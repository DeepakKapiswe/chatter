Message-ID: <000e01c3ff66$90d01950$1501a8c0@lexington>

Hey everyone,

Quick question, I am running a scsi hard drive for Windows XP and an IDE for
Linux.  I primarily use Linux but I want the easy of dual boot instead of
having to reset the bios everytime.  What do i have to make my lilo.conf
look like?  The windows partition is on /dev/sda1 and the linux partition is
on /dev/hda1.  Any suggestions?

Thank you,

Subject: [PLUG] scp problem
Message-ID: <200403011637.i21GbqQl024369@barrierb241.nike.com>

I get this same error when trying to scp files using OpenSSH to a remote system running F-Secure's sshd. I'm not sure that you are having the exact same issue, but the problem in my case is that the OpenSSH scp passes a "-t" option to the remote side to specify the target directory for the files being copied, and F-Secure interprets this "-t" to mean "compatibility mode". There is a clear incompatibility between F-Secure's scp and OpenSSH. I have a case open with F-Secure and they are being very stubborn about even acknowledging that this is an issue. If at all possible, I would recommend to anyone considering anything but OpenSSH to reconsider. Often times companies want to have a vendor responsible for their software and therefore refuse to implement open source solutions. In this case, F-Secure is not taking responsibility and therefore there is no value added by choosing a proprietary solution.

Not that it matters too much, but I happen to agree with Jeme. As a father of two small children who love Dr. Seuss, and being a big fan myself, I read a lot of the good Dr.'s work. The pace and rhythm is very different from Dr. Seuss.

Matt,

It looks like your Win2003 server is the PDC and when you boot the RH9
side there is no PDC to authenticate to (unless the RH9 is set to be a
PDC in other smb.conf parameters).

The section of the smb.conf manpage entitled "NOTE ABOUT
USERNAME/PASSWORD VALIDATION" might help.

HTH,
Keith

It should be as easy as:

Sounds like some computer is looking for a Primary Domain Controller. 
Did you add the RH  box to the Domain?

I don't use LILO right now, but last I recall, here was an option to
hint which BIOS drive each section needed.

Maybe your company should buy another domain name for a year and set up
a Linux mail server the way you want it to replace the existing one. 
With virtual domains, it seems like it would be fairly easy to make your
new site replace the existing one later but I don't even think you need
to go there.  At $35 a year from register.com, you're not entangling
your old system with a new one you want to demonstrate to your employer.
For that matter, why test this on the Internet at all?  Depending on
your company resources, it should be fairly easily to build a simulated
Internet to demonstrate what needs to be demonstrated.  Figure out how
to kick start install the configuration you need for the company and
your good to go as long as you have a window to be down in.  I suppose
the existing server could be put in backup mode and imap taken off it
or the imap ports closed during your upgrade.  As long as there is
enough space on the NT box, you shouldn't lose any email during the
upgrade.

To those of you who work in a mixed-OS environment:

  Is there something a user must do to her installation of Outrage that
would make attachments I send visible? Over the past couple of days I've
sent three pdf attachments to a colleague and she tells me that nothing was
there. I strongly suspect a configuration problem, but I have no idea what
it might be or how to guide her to a solution.

Thanks,

The flash update worked!  I had to put the card in a different machine, of
course, in order to boot form a dos floppy (which was incredibly hard to
make, given that I don't really have any proprietary software in the
house).

I was VERY worried about the BIOS update because the card is marked with a
Dell part number and so very well could be an OEM card and the Adaptec
site is plastered with notices about flashing OEM or imbedded products and
the world-ending consequences of doing same.

I also had the manual that came with the card and the manual says nothing
about Dell and the Dell support site has no bios updates for the card...
so I took a chance.

Phew.

Rich,

Newer versions of Outlook absoulutly restrict attachments.  See the following
links:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;318515

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;829982

Of course, without detail it's difficult to tell. If your collegue is behind
an Exchange server then of course there are several administrative settings
that could affect this behavior.

  Thanks, Cooper. No, she works on her own so there's no server there. I'll
pass on what I learn to her.

This is not completely true. Outlook only restricts "dangerous"
attachments such as .exe, .vbs, etc. This is Microsoft's effort to prevent
users from shooting themselves in the foot by launching viruses or other
malicious programs.

All Microsoft based file types and any "normal" business application file
type works fine in Outlook.

As to your problem, I'd try sending that pdf file to yourself, or to
another email account you have that is outside your network (I assume
your sending from work) If you can receive it fine, you can assume its
something on her end. You might even have her try Outlook Express or some
other email client besides Outlook. I use Outlook at work and have never
had a problem with pdf files.

Recent MS updates have been making changes to a working installation of
Outlook.  The two worst are changing the SMTP authorization settings (turn 
them off) and cranking up the security (or what passes as security) 
settings.

Have her start Outlook, Select Tools, Select the Security TAB and then
look for something about attachments.  I get to deal with this almost
daily but since I don't have Outlook on any systems at home I can't
remember the exacting item in the Security Settings TAB.  (Only because
I've taken users through this so much -- and it ain't my job even -- can I
remember how to get this far.)


I used to be VERY anti-MS product.  But then I realized it's an excellant 
revenue stream.  I have to make up excuses to visit businesses that have 
Linux based servers (several of them became good friends) but I'm always 
visting the MS based sites 'cause that c**p is always breaking.

Jack,

  I've sent these same files many times to others and have had no problems.
You raise an interesting point, however. Both of the local folks who have
had problems receiving .pdf files I've sent them are customers of Earthlink.
I don't know if that's relevant, but it is interesting.

  Also, work == home here. What used to be the living room has been the
office for almost seven years.

Thanks,

Rich

Another possibility I didn't see mentioned was the size of the .pdf
file.  Some ISPs or web based email accounts don't allow attachments if
they are of a certain size and larger.  Perhaps the .pdf is too large
for her ISPs liking?

I've seen outlook refuse Word and Excel docs, apparently the macros are
too dangerous to allow on MS machines...

Brian,

  50-60K. Even Earthlink should permit this.

That's very cruel of you to jump in and correct your own blunder thereby
depriving all of your many admirers on the list the pleasure.  Kind of
you to leave "english". :-)

Rod,

  She's probably using Outrage Express as a single-user in her home office.
I found a Web site that walks someone through the above -- with pictures,
too -- and I sent her the URL.

  I also suggested that she add the phrase, "Microsoft productivity

  In any case, I'll print the documents and fax or mail them to her.

That and Citrix are the worst part about work.  Why should my OS slow
me down that much?  Does having to hit Ctrl-C to copy, and and Ctrl-V
to paste really have to be mandatory?  Why not just do it the right
way, select copies, middle-click pastes?  And stability...Citrix is
about as stable as Charlie Manson, and Citrix is more stable than
Windows...seems like all I do at work is get slowed down by Windows
poorly designed UI and rebooting...

  I'm organizing a directory containing a lot of files by moving them to the
appropriate subdirectory. To expedite this process I would like to list only
the existing subdirectories. The '-d' option to 'ls' gives me only the pwd
as a dot-slash.

  Is there a 'ls' option I mis-read that will list only subdirectories in a
directory?

I can't think of a set of option for ls by itself that will just print
directories recursively - but it's easy using find:

find . -type d -print

Assuming you don't want anything but the subdirectories in the current
directory, you'll want the maxdepth and mindepth options too:

  find . -type d -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1

Stafford,

  Much obliged! Works like a charm. I like it even better when I remove the
print option and pipe the output through sort.

I don't know of one off-hand, but 'ls -F | grep /$' is easy enough.

That other guy who mentioned the bios settings may have been onto 
something - that the settings were fubar'd and causing the mobo conflict 
issues (hit "alt-a" to enter I believe).  I personally prefer to get all 
my BIOS up to date (particularly when they're over 4 versions old). 
 I've had problems with the 2940UW older BIOS not supporting w2k pro 
bootable CD (I believe bios version 1.32), but flashing to the latest 
2.20 bios resolved the boot problem.

Ayup,I've had the very same worries myself with Dell and Gateway sticker 
labels on some of my AHA-2940UW cards.  The one thing that seems to be 
key here is to ensure that the on-screen BIOS message does not have an 
"S" in it (true indication of OEM card).  I've flashed about 10 of these 
cards so far, and haven't had a problem yet (none had the "S" in the 
on-screen BIOS message) - in fact, I made a slight edit to their batch 
file, in order to allow the same disk to be used over and over (no more 
saving old bios, no more checking if old bios already exists on floppy - 
something like that).

Just curious, why did you bother going from 2940UW to 2940U2W?  From 
what I have been able to gather, most U2W drives are limited by an 
~18-23MB/s transfer rate to/from media - sure there will be the rare 
occasional 40MB/s (or 80MB/s with the U2W) bursts to/from disk cache, 
but that should be essentially negligable.  Unless there are particular 
cases where this burst mode actually pays off?

The only time I could see U2W being beneficial, is if you get some of 
the newer SCSI U160/320 15K drives that support 50-65MB/s transfer rates 
to/from media - but then you're talking $4++ per gig (just the drive 
alone).  Of course there is also RAID, a separate beast that I can 
easily see needing U2W (I just picked up a nice AAA-131U2 and have 64MB 
ECC EDO DIMM on the way to replace that measily 2MB default cache)...

I love using old SCA 18GB drives (ST118202LC) with the 2940UW, nice and 
fast *enough* - and pretty economical on a $/gig scale.  I also picked 
up a nice old P2L97-S, which has an aic-7880 (essentially 2940UW) on it, 
which will soon be running a celeron 733.    :)  

Oh, and to keep it slightly on-topic, I use these things in many 
dual-boot w2k/redhat8 boxes (have used redhat 6.2, 7.3, 8.0 and 9 - but 
9 simply seemed to miss the mark in terms of 
performance/stability/flexibility), and need to mess with mandrake next 
me thinkz...

  Yea! Someone else with a 6035 who wants to use it as a cellular modem from
a system (in my case, from my notebook). I've been trying to get it to work
for over 2 years now.

  It would be great if the collective geek intelligence of this group could
focus on how to make it happen.

  On my former notebook, I could dial into my ISP, but the connection was
immediately broken. I've not yet tried to use the phone/PDA on my new
notebook. Other priorities are higher.

Yeah, the -print option is default in gnu find, so it's not necessary to
specify. I'm probably laboring under habits developed on some older form
of Unix where it was necessary to add the -print.

I know you're using find now, but I think you meant to use `ls -d ./*`
before.

Often these kinds of obscure things benefit greatly from hands-on

  The only difference I see when using the above compared to using only 'ls'
is that the former adds a dot-slash in front of each filename and directory
name.

  In this case, I'll be at the next clinic with Sony Vaio VCG-505C,

Sorry.  I was referring to Outlook Express.  Outlook (at least 2000+) 
requires a registry hack.  (Don't you just love it?  :-)

I'd like to get a wireless card for an old laptop I have that has redhat
6.2 installed (2.2.14 kernel).  I've looked at the personal telco list
of Prism2 cards, but I wonder if any of them are available at this

from a philosophical and a practical point of view.  I'm afraid that I
might run into issues with a binary driver on such an old system.  A

Exactly - the "-d" option to ls means list the directory entry, and not
the contents of the directory.

Message-ID: <20040302220043.GA29391@patch.com>

the -d option tells ls to "list directory entries instead of contents"
not to be confused with "list entries that are directories rather than the contents of the argument"

default behavior for ls you provide a directory as an argument is to list the files contained in the directory.

so `ls -d .` would list the dot, as you pointed out earlier

if you have have a directory ./foo with contents of bar and baz

[patch at tire currdir]# ls foo
bar  baz
[patch at tire currdir]# ls -d foo
foo

Jeme could have simplified his example by suggesting `ls -d *` while assuming that you were referring to the current working directory.  for the current working directory `ls -d *` and `ls -d ./*` are synonymous.

I'd like to use my FC1 box to forward certain messages from the
evolution client to another e-mail address.

It looks like one of the options is to pipe a message to a shell command
in my evolution v1.4.5. What would that command look like? I can specify
the address in the command, if it's what I'm thinking, but I've got no
idea what this command would look like.

Suggestions, please.

There is a 200 mW card for ~$80 I've had my eye on.

  <http://www.netgate.com/EL2511.html>
  <http://www.netgate.com/NL2511.html>

(the latter needs an antenna, e.g. the 2.0 dBi clip on)

You probably want to use the HostAP drivers.

Right... I guess I misunderstood your question.

Compare and contrast the following:

ls ./
ls -d ./
ls ./*
ls -d ./*

Because when Apple pioneered the use of cut/copy & paste (ca. 1981),
they used ^X, ^C, and ^V.  When MS stole their look & feel, it only made
sense to take their well-known keyboard shortcuts too.  :-)

I agree that highlight & center-click is often more convenient, but the
well-known shortcuts that have been around since the first real
application of this idea are every bit as much the "right" way.

Unfortunately, the HostAP drivers are not stock and will not be
installed with his kernel.  I have a Lucent WaveLAN Bronze 2Mb card that
would likely work /if anything/ with a kernel that age, since it's of
approximately the same vintage.  There are a bunch of them on eBay:

Right.  But compiling the HostAP stuff (non-stockness and all) isn't
too challenging.  At least I haven't found it so.

  <http://hostap.epitest.fi/>

Anyway, I don't have any direct experience with this particular card.
I do have experience with other prism-based cards and HostAP (I am
running 0.1.2 at the moment).  The reference was really just intended
to be a proof-of-continued-existance for prism-based wifi cards.  If
in my eagerness I drooled a little on it, I humbly beg your pardon.

Message-ID: <4044C003.7000700@alcpress.com>

I just spent an hour investigating what it would take to
convert from QuickBooks Pro Version 5 to GNUcash. It seems
that QB Pro saves its data to a QBW file and GNUcash cannot
read that file. I can have QB Pro make a backup but this
produces a QBB file and GNUcash can't read it. I can create
an accountants copy (a QBX) but GNUcash can't read this.

GNUcash can read a QIF file but I can't find a way to get QB Pro
to produce such a file. So a migration doesn't seem possible
without hand entering all the data. If I'm wrong about this,
please let me know.

Is it possible to convert from any of QBW, QBB, and QBX to QIF
using a newer version of QuickBooks?

Ed,

  Have you asked this on the gnucash mail list, too? They can probably give
you step-by-step instructions. Check out <http://www.gnucash.org/> and
gnucash-user at gnucash.org under mailing lists (Help menu, third from the top
on the left).

Yes, I was all over their Web site and I did a Google search that
seemed to include messages from the GNUcash mailing list. Nothing
I found addressed the issue. If there's no joy here, I guess I will
have to subscribe to their mailing list.

You know, when I was building gnucash on my desktop system, I ran into a
problem importing some files from an earlier version.  I hopped on IRC at
like 2am and found one of the developers hangin' (on openprojects
#gnucash, I'm pretty sure).  The person found the bug and DCCd me a patch
file for the source in about ten minutes.  Very cool.

However, I don't think QuickBooks Pro and GnuCash are at all comparable
products.  You're probably looking for something fancier like SQL-Ledger.

the easiest command I found it this 

'ls -d */'

that works great for me and is easy very short to type. you can also add
any of the other ls options to it.

Message-ID: <20040303054305.GA4588@gate.kl-ic.com>

Quickbooks to GNUcash?  Oh, how I wish!!!  That is one of two apps
that keeps me tied to Win4Lin (the other being a CAD app that I am
working right now to replace). 

Even if I got my files converted over, somehow, I need to convert
them back for my accountant.  However, my accountant is getting old
and it is about time to train a new, young, and hungry one.

For those of you that don't know what Ed and I are talking about, 
Quickbooks is the full business ledger big brother of Quicken.  It
has all the magic mojo for employees, structured debt and receivables,
all sorts of things a 5 to 50 employee business needs.  Unfortunately,
the fine folks at Intuit made Quickbooks write-only;  the .QBW format
appears to be encrypted.  Oh, and they give free samples to all the
accountants in the world, so guess what they suggest to their clients.

Those darl-for-brains! 

For a one way conversion, though, there may be an option.  The latest
versions of Quickbooks have an XML option, I am told.  The data can
be exported as XML, which should be relatively painless to convert 
to GNUcash format (for everything that fits, at least).  So, we write
a converter,  share the cost of one expensive Quickbooks upgrade,
then run all our sets of books through the two conversion processes.

Then we run an accountant through the conversion process.

I don't have time, and don't need another project.  However, perhaps
there is some out-of-work person that is looking for a project and a
small business.  I can loan that person manuals for Quickbooks 5 and
Quickbooks 2000 pro (the last version before XML, I believe).
Quickbooks is one of those "register over the phone" programs, so no
loaning copies, even if it wasn't wrong anyway.

I spoke to my accountant about this. He doesn't really need to
get a QuickBooks diskette from us as we've done in the past. He
says that he can work from end of year reports - on paper. So,
starting March 31 (our fiscal year end), I'm converting to GNUcash
or SQL Ledger. It'll take some work getting it initialized for the
business but thereafter it should be easy. We'll just run a report
at the end of the year and not worry about being compatible with
the accountant's software.

QuickBooks is the last legacy Windows app in the office
On April 1, we should be a totally Microsoft-free office.

There was an amusing testimonial on the SQL-Ledger-users list a week or
two ago about this fellow's accountant being very upset at his switch from
Quickbooks to SL.  It seems there was much less to do, so fewer fees.
Schucks.

I think GNUCash is a great replacement for Quicken, but I don't think it's
the sort of app you want for a business.

Thanks to all for the responses.  I was able to get a used Belkin
F5D6020 with the Prism chipset at Belmont Computers.  In order to
get it working, here's what I did.

Upgraded kernel to last one released by redhat, 2.2.24

Built wireless-tools.  At this point, the card might have worked using
the wvlan_cs driver supplied by redhat, but my configuration was wrong,
though I didn't know it at the time.

Removed kernel-pcmcia-cs rpm.  Built latest pcmcia-cs, 3.2.7.  Got an
oops whenever cardmgr tried to load the orinoco modules.

Built pcmcia-cs-3.1.34.  No more oops, but problems with my config files.

Finally realized that I had lowercase characters for my MAC address in
the wireless.opts file.  When the configuration scripts run, they
expect the MAC address to be uppercase.  After correcting this, the
card started working.


BTW, the high output card (200 mW, http://www.netgate.com/EL2511.html)
that Russell mentioned is $65.  The company is in Spokane. They also
sell some interesting antennas.

  For the past decade, my accountant and I have been using incompatible
accounting software. For the past several years I've run LGL (Linux General
Ledger) and she uses some very expensive winduhs software. Each month I
print out the journal entries and trial balances before I close that period.
Come the first of the year I turn all these reports over to her, as well as
the full-year report for the sales journal, cash disbursements journal and
general journal, and she has all the numbers she needs to work her magic.

  It's been a smooth arrangement because she wants to see the complete audit
trail in any case and needs reports on paper for her own work.

  I'd move to SQL-Ledger if I could learn how to run it without the need to
install, configure and run apache just to have a BUI.

  No, it really isn't. Some folks try to force it to work but it's really
designed for the personal bookkeeping market rather than the business
market.

And we usually retire ideas after a few years, right?  That must be why
we're still using bash, BIND, vi[m], etc. etc.  SMTP has been
sub-optimal for years but we're still using *that*, aren't we?  

Standards have tremendous value, whether or not they are optimal
standards.  Fact is, most of what we do on a daily basis is because of
something that made sense in the 1960's or 1970's.  Whether or not it
makes sense now is frequently irrelevant.


> Everyone else has moved on.

Have they?  Many X11 apps support ^C and ^V, including Evo and Mozilla. 

Highlight-and-click is a great technique, but it makes pasting *over*
another selection more cumbersome.  And it's often harder on a laptop.

Choice is good.  There's no need to anoint one "right" way to do such a
common thing.

$.02 more,

Dylan

No, we retire bad ideas after a few years, if even that long.  You
don't see too many cars that can be driven away like it was a fender
bender from an accident in which all passengers inside died anymore.
I haven't even seen a steam engine since last time I drove The Oregon
on the WP&Z (and that was a diesel-fired steamer).

At the moment I am using a Linux distribution that
runs from a CD, "Blin," whose interface is in Russian.
I can always take it with me if I visit someone.

The use of Web mail, such as this account, is ideal
for use with live distributions. Nevertheless, without
storing information externally, a few basic settings
are lost between sessions.

Mount points are available for external devices, such
as a floppy drive. Could anyone direct me to a
discussion of how the information in Mozilla, say,
could be stored on such a device so that it would be
available from one session to the next?

Sorry, I'm running as root. Fortunately, there's
nothing I can damage by doing so.

The easiest way is to mount a storage device to your

snort does it all better, imo. Heck, you could do it with tcp_wrappers
if you wanted.

Call me cynical, though. 

I'll be interested in what others think, too, yeah.

Is the Orinoco Gold now supported?  I have the Classic Gold which works
and I think I bought for $60. (online via a shop in LA) I had a Gold that
wouldn't work under the 2.4 kernel, but I sold it to a windows user.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0403031209300.393@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I'm embarking on something I've never done before: porting someone else's
essentially-undocumented C++ code from winduhs to linux. I'd also like to
either convert it to Java or (at least initially) wrap it so it can run in a
JRE.

  My first problem is learning what tools I can use to to understand how the
application was constructed: perhaps using tags to track what functions are
calling which other ones and to elicit the overall structure and
organization of the application. The original source is a mess and the
author cannot remember what some undocumented functions are supposed to do.

  I do have a working copy that runs in my virtual-win98 in VMware so that
might help.

  If you're willing to assist and can accept deferred compensation, please
contact me off the list. This is an end-user application, not system code,
and it is proprietary -- the future of my busines is based to a large part
on getting this done quickly and correctly.

Thanks,

Rich

Not an answer to what you're asking directly... but...

I'm using an Airlink Plus card.  $30 or so at Fry's.  It's a Prism2
chip.  Really pretty crappy, but it was really pretty cheap.  I've had
driver issues up the wazzoo in my 2.6 kernel, but under 2.4 I haven't
had any issues at all.  There are three sets of drivers that work with
Prism2 based cards; in-kernel Orinoco (might have misspelled that), the
linux-wlan-ng drivers (which I personally dislike), and the HostAP
drivers (which are the ones I am actually using now).

Before my Airlink Plus, I was using an Atmel based card.  It was a
Belkin, I spent about $60 on it at the BX.  It was a really good card. 
Recently, a guy rewrote the drivers for the 2.6 kernel and did a *very*
good job.  I've been very happy with his drivers.  I was pretty happy
with the SF drivers (originally closed-source drivers until Atmel
released the code, all GPL'd like) until I switched to 2.6... they had
some sort of leak somewhere that caused the drivers to go kaput after
about 250MB of data went over the card.

The Atmel had the cheap Prism2 beat out in terms of range and, IMHO,
quality of drivers.

Hmm, the picture they show looks to be the Silver.  Doing a quick scan via
google, it seems the Gold may now work though.  Maybe it's working now.  I
went through my hassle mid last year.
I still recommend the Classic since it works well with the 2.6 without any
hassle.  (2.4 with some hassle)

Mark,

  OK. I went by the title ("Gold"). Right now I have the 2.4 kernel. When
Patrick releases the next Slackware with the 2.6 kernel I'll be using that.

Rob,

  Because I've not used any of these, does it make any practical difference
between the slower, 'b', cards and the faster, 'g', capable cards?

The only difference between the Gold and Silver is the maximum key
length accepted by the (useless) WEP.

Speed and range.  I understand the 802.11G frequency doesn't travel as
far as 802.11b's 2.1GHz.  I haven't actually read any tests to back that
up, mind you, it's just what I've heard in the rumor mill.  :-)

Speed; the 802.11b cards will give you 11Mbps.  If you're copying big
files around, you'll notice.  It takes a few minutes to move a 300MB
file over the link.  However, if you're not moving any big files over
the link, you'll never notice you aren't on a hard-wired connection. 
802.11G runs at 54Mbps, roughly half as fast as most wired connections. 
Oh, and cost... the 'g' stuff is still more expensive.

I don't think the next version will include 2.6... it *might* include it
as an option, but I don't see it being default.  It isn't in
slackware-current right now, although the source is available.

Slackware 9.1 is Kernel 2.6 drop-in ready.  Make a /sys, compile your
kernel, install it, reboot, and you're good to go.

  I'm just starting to clean things up. There are 512 files, including .cpp,
.h and what are probably Microsoft-specific files. I've already found two
equal header files, but one named in all uppercase letters the other in all
lowercase letters, and another header file that's not included by any .cpp
or .h, according to grep.

  When I get done dusting and cleaning I'll be able to answer your question.

  It looks to me like it was done in some winduhs IDE. No programmer-added
comments (so far) and no MAKEFILE.

Thanks,

***Joe Trippi keynote added to Digital Democracy Teach-In
Joe Trippi, the man whose ground-breaking use of Internet-based
campaigning propelled Howard Dean from obscurity to early front-runner,
has just signed on as keynoter at the Digital Democracy Teach-In. Former
Dean campaign manager Trippi will take Teach-In participants inside the
campaign's unconventional experiment in Internet politics, and look at
both victories and lessons learned. While Dean may no longer be leading
the pack, the other candidates are rushing to emulate Trippi's Internet
strategy--as "Wired News" declared recently, "Internet politics is dead.
Long live Internet politics." Trippi will kick off the Teach-In at 8:30 am
this coming Monday, February 9, in San Diego, CA.

Ken Milburn follows up on suggestions he made in Part 1 of this two-part
series about creating a minimally destructive workflow for the work you do
inside image-editing software. Here he offers five nondestructive editing
steps to take once you've downloaded your images. Then he provides some
second-stage editing techniques to enhance the impact your images will
have on your clients, or your friends and family. Ken is the author of the
upcoming "Digital Photography: Expert Techniques."

To directly answer your question, I don't have any personal experience
with data recovery in Portland.  However, I've had excellent luck using
"readcd" which comes with "cdrecord" to recover damaged CD-ROMs.  Whatever
data is there, it will be able to pull off if coupled with a good CD-ROM
drive.  (I.e. Plextor)

Grab the latest cdrecord from:

http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/cdrecord.html

Build it, and run the command:

cdrecord -scanbus

That will give you the SCSI device list on your system.  Identify the one
for your CD-ROM drive and run:

readcd dev=0,0,0 f=/tmp/recovered-file.iso speed=1 retries=1024

(substitute 0,0,0 for your correct device)

This will read the disk as slowly and carefully as it can, retrying 1024
times on each error.  Hopefully at each damaged point the ECC will "get
lucky" and form a correctable read.

If the CD has been seriously damaged (i.e. backing has peeled off or been
badly scracted) there may be nothing you (or anyone) can do.

Data recovery services tend to be VERY expensive, and probably won't do
anything more than what "readcd" does.

802.11g and 802.11b are exactly the same radio frequency; just a

Subject: [PLUG] driver for epson stylus C64 printer
Message-ID: <1078369611.6928.13.camel@osca>

Hello,

I need help installing a Epson Stylus C64 printer with Red Hat 9.0.  The
System Tools/Print Manager application doesn't have an entry for the
Epson Stylus C64 (it does driver for the C62).  Since RH9 doesn't have
the right driver, I went to epson's website and downloaded the C64
driver rpms:

pips-sc64_63s-2.6.2-1.i386.rpm
pips-sc64_63s-cups-2.6.2-1.i386.rpm

when I try to install either of these rpms, I get an error message
saying 

error: Failed dependencies:
        libcrypto.so.0.9.6 is needed by pips-sc64_63s-cups-2.6.2-1
        libssl.so.0.9.6 is needed by pips-sc64_63s-cups-2.6.2-1

These libraries are in the openssl rpm; I have version ...0.0.7a instead
of ..0.9.6.  I ignored these ssl libraries via

rpm -i --nodeps pips-sc64_63s-2.6.2-1.i386.rpm

Once I'd installed the rpm and rebooted, the System Tools/Print Manager
app reported that the Epson C64 was installed; so far so good. 
Unfortunately, when I try to print a test page I get the top border and
thats all on the first page.  The printer keeps spitting out blank pages
after that without printing anything on them.  

Can anyone tell me how to install the epson C64 driver correctly?

Thanks,

Dave

Why do all of the 802.11g devices say they run in the 5 Ghz range?  And
we all know that 802.11b is using the 2.4 Ghz range.  I haven't played
much with 802.11a devices, but I seem to recall that they also run in
the 2.4 Ghz range.

Just a little confused.

I've been happy with my Cisco Aironet 350.  It's a little on the pricey
side for 802.11b, but has excellent reception and it was automatically
detected the moment I first plugged it in.  I picked mine up on amazon.com

2.4GHz is pretty wide... there's enough room for WiFi, Bluetooth, and
cordless phones, all running in the same room.  My cordless phone
(2.4GHz) regularly sits a few inches from my wifi card.

Yes.  WiFi signals can get noticably worse when a 2.4GHz phone is in
use.  Using channel 11 can help.

Okay, here's whats going on(from somone who's passed the CISCO 1 cirriculum) with the latest, and most popular wireless standards.

802.11a has a short range, operates at 54Mbits, and uses the 5ghz spectrum, and is incompatible with 802.11b(i.e. if one is running, the other CANNOT within the same physical area), 802.11b has a moderate range, operates at 11Mbits, and uses the 2.4ghz spectrum, 802.11g is a technology(OFDM) that allows 802.11a and 802.11b to coexist in the same physical area. 

Oh, and the actual throughput of wireless is much lower than you would expect. 11Mbps is closer to 2 to 4 Mbits actual, and 54Mbps is closer to 20 to 26 Mbits. The reason for these is that the CSMA/CA(carrier sense multiple access / collision avoidance) is similar to CSMA/CD on wired, although when a computer successfully recieves a packet, it uses up roughly 50% of the bandwidth with an AWK to let the sending host know the packet was recieved.

Another thing to proceed caution with is other devices such as 2.4ghz wireless phones, 5 ghz wireless phones, and bluetooth. Supposedly bluetooth and wi-fi can peacefully coexist(although i haven't tried), although bluetooth and 2.4ghz wireless phones and wi-fi "b" cannot, and same with wi-fi "a" and 5ghz phones....this is a touchy subject and i'm not completely sure as some may be able to get away with it and others may not.

I hope this helps you in determining which is better for your needs.

802.11g devices are not using 5ghz; they also use 2.4ghz.  It's the 
encoding method that lets them send "potentially" 54megabits.  To let 
"g" and "b" devices be somewhat compatible, "g" devices can fall back to 
the encoding method used by "b" devices.

802.11a is 5ghz.

If an 802.11b or 802.11g devices happens to hit the same frequency as a 
wireless phone in the 2.4ghz band, yes there can be interference.  You 
can play with channel assignments to try to work around it.  You can 
also (for example) get 2.4ghz interference from flourescent lights, 
microwave ovens, etc.

I supose the same thing is true of the newer 5ghz wireless phones and 
802.11a; if they happen to hit exactly the same frequence there will be 
interference.

 From what I've seen, 802.11a is disappearing to some extent from the 
general consumer marketplace.

There are also non-standard versions of 802.11b and 802.11g; advertised 
as having 22meg and 108meg throughput.  If I remember right they're 
using paired channels.  With the emergence of "g" the non-standard 22meg 
devices seem to be going away; the last time I was in Fry's all the 
22meg stuff was on closeout sale.

Sorry for the slight mistake....802.11g introduces 54Mbits to an enviornment that allows 802.11b devices and 802.11g devices to coexist on the 2.4ghz band, although 802.11a still may not exist. And when an 802.11b device exists on that 802.11g enviornment, the 802.11g cards revert to B as to not interfere with the B card...which can dramatically reduce performance on the G card. There is also a difference in the encoding schemes between the 3 technologies.

The devices that allow 802.11b and 802.11a are the "dual band" wireless AP's which have a much higher price, although can allow interopability between the 3 standards(A, B, and G).

this article is a tad outdated, although might prove useful...

It can. It's an unlicensed band, after all.

Phil,

  Yes it does. Thank you very much. What I infer from all of the
well-thought-out comments posted on this thread are:

  1) Since I'll be using this only away from the house/office, I don't need
to worry about cordless phones; other pontential interferring sources will
also probably be minimal.

  2) The 'g' standard will most likely be replacing the 'b' standard within
the lifetime of my notebook and whatever wireless card I buy, so spending
more for the combined protocols is most likely the most practical decision.

  Thanks very much, all of you. I also see that the premium charged by
Emperor Linux for the 3Com card looks to be not that excessive over what a
3Com 802.11b/g card sells for on amazon.com and other sources.

Personally, I would reference it in broader terms.

"Publicly funded work should belong to the public and benefit the public
as a whole.  This includes copyrightable or patentable works developed
through public development projects or public research funds.  One good
start toward this ideal would be encouraging the adoption of Free and Open
Source software by public agencies."

You can reference the House and Senate bill numbers cited in PLUG
archives.

No, but I've thought very seriously about writing one, but I doubt I'd
have the follow-through or time to do it.

SB941... grep the list archives for more specific information on it.  My
personal archives currently only are easily accessable to December 29,
2002... but the big archives on the web go back almost forever.  :-)

The most recent discussion on the bill I see in my archives happened

webmin can be lighten a lot by going to the webmin configuration area
and only including the modules one needs to have.  Moreover, I think
some of the modules can be lighten a bit by using the configuration
tab or whatever for the module itself - altho this isn't generally
sufficient.  I know we had to write or rewrite a number of modules
for Micro Sharp's Netule project, and in many ways this approach 
worked very well.

Is there any will at SCO anymore to profit on it's own merits?  How are
other companies doing?  The real argument against Microsoft and SCO
is that their business model isn't profitable.  There seem to be many
people with the myopic view of selling software and the "my project,"
syndrome.  Partially, the educational system where textbook monopolies
are so strong despite educational need is probably partially to blame. 
There's a lot of room for improvement at community colleges for example
where often times some proprietary software system doesn't work and
instructors get in competition with the institutions IT staff.  What I
see happening is people increasingly coming to the conclusion that
computers are junk.  This happened with cars at one time causing 
the U.S. auto manufacturer to incur major losses.  I hope it gets
fixed long before major losses occur, I'm not so sure that won't 
require future legislation though.

I'm reluctant to jump too fast, but I do get the impression that either
new laws are needed or old laws need to be enforced in the case of SCO.
If the courts can be bribed into treating Linux as someone's legal
property, we have far greater problems than Linux's future to worry
about.  If Microsoft is losing massive amounts of money on this though,
maybe it's evening the playing field.  The more Microsoft loses on
failed litigation so long as it maintains a predatory business model,
the better.

I was confused, I didn't realize that 802.11a is capable of 54Meg/s
communication.  The marketing people are doing a good job of avoiding
the fact that 802.11a is on the way out.

Something I still don't get is why 802.11a cannot be run in the same
physical space as the other 802.11 devices.  It seems to me that the
frequencies are far enough apart that there should be no interference,
so what prevents them from coexisting?

They were pushing 108Meg stuff last time I was there, but I had never
heard of it, which makes me think that it is a proprietary dual radio
device, that is not really capable of 108Meg/s throughput, but can
transmit and receive simultaneously.  Some marketing guy then added 54
and 54 to make it seem like a very fast device.  This is all conjecture
though, because, like I said, I had never heard of it until that fateful
visit to Fry's.

Getting less confused as time goes on, thanks to all of you.

Erm yeah, you're right.....but its still a rediculous way to ensure the packet

Subject: [PLUG] Routing through non bridged DSL...
Message-ID: <1078457413.17632.23.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I had my cisco DSL-500 bridged because I couldn't masquerade through it.
Is this the case with the Actiontec 1520's that are so common now too?

One curiosity is if there is an alternative to masquerading that would
work with the DSL-500 Cisco box in it's non bridged configuration.

I know you can do aliasing where I wonder if that and a combination
of source and destination nat on a Linux router would do the trick?

It normally has a private subnet in it's normal mode.  The idea would
be to have a one to one correspondence between alias ip addresses and
local ip addresses of machines I want to grant Internet access to. 
Essentially, my idea is to take any packet that shows up on say the
external alias and rewrite the destination address so that it
gets to the internal host.  For packets going out from an internal
host, source nat could be employed to change the source address
to the alias equivalent.  

How is gateway's address used by host-a?

----------    -----------    ---------------
| host-a |----| gateway |----| remote-host |
----------    -----------    ---------------

The machine host-a presumably creates a packet with it's 
source address destined for remote-host, but it's sent to 
the gateway first.  Aren't there only two ip addresses 
in an IPv4 packet?

Does host generate a packet with the source address set to 
the gateway, or does every ip packet have a routing address 
in addition to source and destination addresses?  Is the 
packet with the source of host and the destination broadcast?  
That can't be, the gateway address is needed on host to get 
out.

Are you *sure* Evo doesn't offer a "forward" or "bounce" action?

That is, pipe through the "mail" command, with options to specify the

Lay-flat bindings are back. Readers of O'Reilly books will once again be
able to plop their book next to a terminal or on a cafe table and be sure
that it will stay open to the page they're perusing. O'Reilly is
reinstating the RepKover binding, which allows the interior of a book to
"float" free from its cover. More durable and flexible than a traditional
perfect binding, the RepKover binding allows the interior of a book to lay
flat when open. The bindings will start appearing in bookstores
immediately. Going forward, all new books will be produced with the
much-loved lay-flat binding (except for books that are too thin or thick
for the RepKover process).

***Amazon and Open Source
Amazon realized early on that amazon.com was more than just a book site,
more in fact than just an e-commerce site. It was becoming an e-commerce
platform. Open source has been a key part of the Amazon story, and
although Amazon has closed code, it has created its own "architecture of
participation" that may be even richer than that of many open source
software development communities. Tim shares his thoughts in the 
latest Ask Tim.

***Mod_python's PSP: Python Server Pages 
For simple web sites, inlining code in the pages themselves is shockingly
effective. For more complex sites, it can even work with good MVC design.
Fear not, Pythonistas, mod_python's PSP brings the power and clarity of
Python to web programming. Grisha Trubetskoy explains.

***Day in the Life of #Apache 
Rich Bowen tackles yet another common Apache dilemma in the latest
installment in this series based on his conversations on the IRC channel,
#apache. This week he delves into the sometimes confusing world of
modules: when to enable them, when to disable them, and why.

them manually, scripting starts to look very appealing. brian d foy shows
you some helpful AppleScripts and Perl scripts you can use to clean up
your iPhoto libraries.

***bash on Mac OS X 
In the migration from Jaguar to Panther, one of the lesser-discussed
changes has been the switch from tcsh to bash as the default shell (for
new accounts). In this article, David Miller delves into affected areas,
such as aliases and environment variables, to help you make the
transition.

***The Ideal Digital Photographer's Workflow, Part 3 
You can achieve greater control over the quality of the images produced by
your new digital camera if you shoot them in RAW format. Trouble is, it
can take an inordinate amount of time to convert RAW images into something
your image-editing program can use. In Part 3 of Ken Milburn's series on
creating ideal digital photography workflows, he details several steps you
can take to save hours of RAW-process work after every shoot. Ken is the
author of the upcoming "Digital Photography: Expert Techniques."

Yeah, that was the problem, I guess.  So I added the necessary lines to
smb.conf to make it a PDC, added the users and their passwords, and the

Subject: [PLUG] hdparm and partition tables
Message-ID: <20040306055401.GB29920@gate.kl-ic.com>

Last night in my presentation I mentioned that hdparm doesn't reread
the partition table for disks after hotswapping.

With help from Elliott Mitchell, and the source for /sbin/hdparm,
I learned that when loading a new drive, I should be typing:

hdparm -zb 0 /dev/backup    instead of hdparm -b 0 /dev/backup

RTFSC, I guess.  Of course, once you know the correct nomenclature,
RTFM also applies.

Mea Culpa.  For punishment, I shall read the Collected Wisdom of
Darl McBride.  All done.

Well, I figured out how getting to a gateway works.  Pulled out a 
book I picked up at OSU on TCP/IP networking and eventually found 
a section on it.

What annoys me is that I get so much spam that has invalid addresses
in it where I can't seem to enable Postfix's header checking without
blocking legitimate email.  It seems that a lot of legitimate sites
either aren't forward listed or reverse listed, but they aren't
consistent.  I need a rule that implements an inclusive or on 
reverse and forward address checks, but does Postfix offer this?
Maybe intro to SQL next term will suggest new approaches to
the problem.

The other trick I'd like to pull is processing mail with perl so that
I can extract certain words mixed in with trash characters where this
stuff gets through spamassassin undetected otherwise.

Another thing I'm running into a lot of is a spam trying to bounce from
my server where the server it tries to bounce to 550's it.  For once
it would be nice to see more legitimate emails in my logs than bounces,
etc.  If I 550 an attempt by someone to send email to me, it's stuck
in their cache, right?  I would think if I didn't let somebody connect
to me to send email that they would give up at some point.  Is it
normal to get a lot of apparently unregistered dsl addresses in spam?
For the infinite bounce problem, I've automated a defer cache sweep,
though I seem to be sweeping at least two to three messages a day.

Uh... you're talking about a fairly hefty piece of software, then.

jbrelin at person:~$ ls -l /bin/bash /usr/bin/vim
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root       551548 Sep 25  2001 /bin/bash*
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root       756860 Sep  3  2001 /usr/bin/vim*
jbrelin at person:~$ file /bin/bash /usr/bin/vim
/bin/bash:    ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV),
dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped
/usr/bin/vim: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV),
dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped

That's pretty much one full floppy right there... no kernel, no init, no
nothin'.

Now, if you want something smaller, you might be able to squeeze ash and
elvis-tiny onto a floppy with a very bare kernel, but you'd be pushing it.

But you might be looking for something more like a root-boot floppy that
is essentially a rescue kernel and one of the mini-shell/swiss army knife
utilities like busybox.

What's the purpose of such a thing?  Isn't this why God made Knoppix?

This lists several distributions on floppy.  Some are one floppy, some 
are several.  I think Tom's Root Boot is one of the best of the bunch 
and use it as an emergency rescue floppy.  See #27 in the list.

Best,
Kyle

I've used a number of floppy distro's my favorite was tiny linux, but I 
can't seem to find that one anymore.  However in looking for the page I 
did track this little distro down, seems to be pretty close to what you 
are looking for.
http://zoollinux.sourceforge.net/

Also here is a page with a full list of floppy distro's

http://www.linuxlinks.com/Distributions/Floppy/

Hope this helps.

The 2.6 kernel's NTFS write support is very limited... I believe it is
more limited than 2.4's, but it is *safe* to use.  With 2.6, you're able
to write anything to pre-existing files, so long as you do not alter the
file's size.  That's it.

The 'Captive' NTFS driver, on the other hand, is able to use Windows
files to do the hard work of playing the NTFS game.  You're able to read
and write properly...

I don't understand why nobody has heard of this thing... it has so many
uses (fixing b0rk3d windoze computers accounting for almost all of the
uses).

OK, here's the sitch, kids:

I have this samba server.  It has LDAP installed and (I think) configured.
It has smbldap tools installed and (I think) configured and working.

I'm trying to make it DO something that seems useful.

What I REALLY want is a simple server that will authenticate users for all
shares on the network and create user and machine accounts when necessary.
I want the "single sign on" thing where I don't need to do local machine
configuration except to tell the client to which domain it belongs.

Am I crazy?  When I create users by hand, they don't authenticate.  When I
try to set "security = domain", testparm tells me it's "not recommended".
And when I read the docs at samba.org, it appears as though this only
works when you've got a Winders server doing the real authentication.

What gives?  Is there a better HOW-TO on this?

Gaaaah!!!

It's already a nice addition to INSERT, a Knoppix mini-CD... I don't
remember if I've ranted about INSERT on PLUG yet or not, but I really
really like the thing.  It's the first rescue CD I've actually found
myself using quite frequently when working on dead or dying computers.

I've been struggling with Samba too.  I recently picked up an excellent
book, "The Official Samba-3 HOWTO and Reference Guide."
ISBN: 0-13-145355-6

Definitely pick it up.  There's lots of example setups at the beginning
and then it dives into the details in the later chapters.

Derek Loree, in a later post, asked what it was. So
perhaps there's enough interest that I need not answer
him off the list. 

It's a program for recording movie clips and saving
them in a format that can be replayed, using a Web
cam.

My intention was to indicate that the system
requirements would not be severe. By the way, my Web
cam still exceeds what Movie Maker, one of Microsoft's
best-known applications, can do.

Indeed. If you ask a typical person whether they know
what Movie Maker is, and what Samba is (other than a
card game), neither would get a majority, but I think
far more people would be familiar with Movie Maker.

By the way, any other suggestions?

Yes--as I said, Microsoft should include Knoppix in

I got the impression that this book is just a hardcopy of what is

impression:

  <http://us2.samba.org/samba/docs/>

  ``The current Samba-3 release version of the Samba-HOWTO-Collection

We don't all have US$40-50 to throw down on documentation.  There's, you
know, food and stuff to consider first.

The fact is, I don't even really care about LDAP.  I just want Samba to do
what I want it to do without a Windows Domain Controller.

It seems like a fairly straightforward thing.  "Samba Single Sign-On
How-To"  Why doesn't it exist?  Is it because it's not possible?

I believe you're asking the wrong question.  The answer lies not in SAMBA, 
but in PAM.  PAM controls with authentication methods are considered 
for your environment.  PAM orders the sequence of authentication tries.
PAM is your friend.

Only if you disable encrypted passwords over the wire, which is not
recommended, because it's insecure and because it's a hassle to install
the appropriate registry setting on each system.

Right.  'security = domain' is for when the Samba server is a MEMBER of
an SMB domain, rather than domain controller or stand-alone server.  One
of the latter of the two cases is what you want; both require 'security
= user'.

Exactly how are you creating users by hand?  What does your smb.conf
look like?  Are your LDAP ACLs too tight?  Does does an entry created by
this 'by hand' method look like (hint: ldapsearch)?

> What gives?  Is there a better HOW-TO on this?

Well, there are several, but taking a little time to understand LDAP
would make it easy; LDAP is a big technology to assimilate along with
the mix of Samba authentication.  That said, you don't HAVE to use LDAP
if you don't need replicated authentication (such as having a Backup
Domain Controller)--you can keep everything in flat files (passwd,
smbpasswd, group) like you've always been able to with Samba 2.2.

Subject: [plug] Mounting a linux drive on a Windows box via tunnel
Message-ID: <404CB616.1AF16AAA@tercent.net>

Hi folks,

I have two locations behind firewalls, and I'd like to do a little web
editing using a Windows-based editor, with the files on a remote Linux
box.  The firewalls have 80, 443, and 22 punched through for http/s and
ssh.

I tried Samba tunneling over ssh; it works no problems with my Linux/Mac
OS X boxes (of course) but seems impossible to get going over Windows
(of course).

Does anyone know of a simple solution for how I can use a Windows-based
editor on some remote files without the intermediate step of scp'ing
them back and forth between saves?  I don't have concurrency issues
because it would just be me.

Alternatively, does anyone know of a good Linux-based
syntax-highlighting IDE that supports Perl (I could just tunnel an X
session)?

Best,

Randall

I started with "security = user", but then the Samba-3 How-To said that
domain security was the way to go for "single sign on".  I figured I was
closer to the right track before.

smbldap-useradd

Uh... it's a little long, but it's totally consistent with your wiki

I don't think I've configured any.

I've never used ldapsearch and a cursory glance at the man page doesn't
make a usable command line obvious.

I couldn't get that to work, either, though.  I am MORE than willing to
forego LDAP in exchange for something that actually works.  (Though,
again, the Samba-3 How-To Collection basically pushes you away from
anything but LDAP.)

At the same time, I've got so much of this ready to go, it seems like I'm
just a step away... I just can't find that step.

I don't think you really want to try for "single sign-on"; SSO is more
like Kerberos, where all the services on your network are authenticated
only once, when the user logs in to his machine.  It supposedly can be
achieved with Kerberos, but I haven't done the setup or tested enough to
know how many clients actually support the required authentication
mechanisms.

The global section is really the only interesting thing.

That's probably why; OpenLDAP defaults IIRC to read-only access by
anonymous (or anyone else) and read-write access to the rootdn only. 
Now that I look at my doc, I totally left off the ACL stuff, because I'd
intended to add it later in different sections for master and slave LDAP
servers.

I'm assuming you're behind a reasonably protected network and there
aren't script kiddies continuously looking for any hole to get in, so
why don't you try a wide-open ACL by setting the default access to
'write' (just add a line 'defaultaccess write' to slapd.conf) and
restart.  See if you can add a user with smbldap-add that works
afterwards; my guess is the addition fails.

ldapsearch -x -D <ROOTDN> -W -b <basedn> -h <ldaphost> \
objectclass=sambaSamAccount

The -x is the key part that's easy to over-look.

Well, it does for PDC/BDC setups, because it's the only way to do it
reliably.  Unless your setup is more complicated than I've been able to
infer, you don't need a PDC/BDC setup.  That said, I think the LDAP ACL
is probably the most immediately missing part.

Do you need a full-blown IDE, or just a syntax-highlighting editor? If
the latter, your choices are many:

* vim
* emacs
* gedit (2.4.x; I don't think 2.2.x does syntax highlighting)
* kate (KDE Advanced Text Editor)

and a gazillion others. I happen to be partial to vim, but they'll all
do the job.

On the IDE side of things, Googling for 'linux perl ide' returns a few
interesting links.

process hangs after a couple of steps (as seen when running ssh with '-vv').
But, when I invoke ssh with the IP address the connection is almost instant.

  I suspect this is related to the DNS server at the company providing 'Net
access in hotels, airports and the like, but the IP address and domain name
have been associated for several years.

  Your thoughts on what can cause this behavior is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Rich

I'll put it this way: is anything better than
Camstream? Open-source developers don't flood my
mailbox with spam, so one has to look around a bit for
applications.

Meanwhile, you're hard at work on Jeme Brelin's Samba
problem. At least, I think so. Anyhow, were you aware
that Microsoft's Services for UNIX has been tested
with Red Hat 8.0? It may even be free. I didn't get to
the download page, but there didn't seem to be major
obstacles in my path. If it is free, I may use it myself.

You could try tcptraceroute, it would at least show where the slow down
or failure is happening.

Good Luck,

True, but John Terpstra is the author. I have a great deal of respect for

I've been working on automated scripts for Red Hat installs. The paths
and so on will likely be wrong for Debian, but you might still find it
educational to try to port these over.

Nice of Russell to point out a free source for the info.

Ah.  OK, no other NT server?  Then you want Samba to be the PDC
[Primary Domain Controller].  LDAP is a separate issue, save it for
later.

That said, here's a couple Samba-PDC LDAP howtos:

1. SCP everything over and back.  CygWin has scp, and some Windows GUI
SSH clients support SCP as "file transfer".

2. Get WebDAV working on the Linux web servers.  On Windows it's
called "Web Folders".

3. SSH in and use a Real Editor. ;)

By 'remote login' do you mean

a) from a machine on your LAN, or
b) from a machine off your LAN, or
c) both?

Try an nslookup or dig. How long does that take? Does it return the correct info? It could be a routing issue.

All,

Would someone like to go out and find out if the distro's that carry
weekly news updates has RSS feeds? I'd like to add them to mwvlug's web
site.

This way, not only can you get all the news from LinuxToday and
NewsForge, but you'll also be able to conveniently scan the headlines
for the distro's as well. 

Come to think about it, it would be nice to have an RSS feed for
security updates as well!

I use 'webcam' which is/was part of the xawtv package. The copy I'm running
was built from the sources a while ago, but the xawtv package I installed
from the latest Mandrake didn't seem to include it.

I believe I discounted Camstream because I needed something I could script.
I have 3 webcams running in my house and I didn't want to have to manually
set them up on every reboot.

That and a little JavaScript works reasonably well.

Hello Linux folkz,
I'm using OpenOffice with MySQL and unixODBC 
to view and import data into spread sheets.
Is it possible to do the same but in reverse?
Export data from OO spread sheet into MySQL,
assuming that the number and order of columns are
matching to the number and order of fields in MySQL.

Many thanks in advance,
Alex

This is still a bit nebulous -- a webcam's just a video source, and
you could easily use any movie capture software available for Linux.

Anyhoo, I've been meaning to try this someday with mine:

works out.

SFU is pretty natty. I've downloaded it (it is free) and *somehow*
managed to install it. (Someone on a message board somewhere said that
apart from WinME, this must be the worst product Microsoft has ever
made.) You really should use cygwin instead. :-)

(And I must say "SFU" is the most hilarious acronym.)

Oh, and as far as the "Services" bit: It does remapping of NIS and has
an NFS server. NIS. Oh yay. Contain my excitement.

Message-ID: <1078864680.13137.55.camel@sparticus>

All,

I'm pleased to announce that I've configured MWVLUG's web site to
include instant news feeds from Linux Today, News Forge, O'Reilly,
Debian Planet, Fedora, and Gentoo. Basically, it's a "one stop shopping
center" for your Linux news needs. Of course, the site is here:

  http://www.mwvlug.org

As always, you may and are encouraged to post your own stories as you
see them. You may view the site's statistics so far this month here:

  http://www.gencom.us/cgi-bin/awstats.pl?config=www.mwvlug.org&update=1

Yeah, our traffic rate is growing!

Meanwhile, I don't mind telling you that I've "got RSS religion." I
mean, the idea that you can have story posts go out automatically to
people who want to see them is very powerful. 

It's possible--and I mean it's possible--to have the feed automatically
send out an email to a mailing list every time a new story is posted.
Lug-news mailing list perhaps?

By the way, if you'd like to RSS MWVLUG's site, you may of course do so
using this link:

  http://www.mwvlug.org/backend.php


Thanks,

Why won't my mailserver give up and stop littering my logs with
Connection refused?  I blocked these addresses locally later, 
my mailserver was getting rejected messages from these ip 
numbers before I blocked them locally.  What triggered trying
to send to these addresses and Connection refused
in the first place?  Am I looking at bounce attempts, or am
I infected with an email generator?

I'd like to get checking for A and MX records working, the 
error from email not getting in from pluglist to me hopefully 
shows the problem.  The mailhub I want to fix, goose, can look 
up lists.pdxlinux.org and the ip address using the host command 
no problem.  So why am I getting Sender Domain not found?  Does 
postfix use a different command than host that is broken or 
something?

I'm starting to think that's what needed is an SQL database
and some heuristics to set up temporary blocking if this is
the same guy on DSL or Cable doing this.  It seems like I'm
getting the same message from the same place multiple times,
but on the other hand, there is some slight variation that
looks like nothing more than random garbage characters.  I
wish something could be done to make it easier to defeat
mass email generators.  A USAA magazine listed a poll
that says 94% of people are angry about Internet porn 
and Internet spam.  Spamassassin isn't catching junk
that's hidden by garbage characters, but I'd prefer 
not to let spam get in in the first place.  I don't want
to spend time writing filters, if I can avoid that.

I think using blacklist sites and DNS verification isn't 
working because of DNS problems.  It's hard to see what 
those problems are though because DNS seems to work just 
fine.  I don't have a correct init script for dual DNS 
which I am needing to run.  I have two chroot jails for
a lan and an Internet DNS server where I want to restrict
my internal DNS server to querying by my lan and the 
outside servers to queries from Internet hosts which 
I have attempted to implement by how I bind the servers 
to my interfaces.  I don't know if Bind 9 can run one
dns server that acts as two with different network
views, but that sure would be nice.  I've always wanted
to implement my own domain system on my lan so I can use
name_of_the_room.home, but dns only seems to be desinged
for one naming hierarchy so I've used my externally
registered name internally.

Subject: [PLUG] New Linux class at LCC
Message-ID: <200403091432.42050.kenb@nu-world.com>

Spring Term will commence in about three weeks and with it will 
come some changes in the Linux sysadmin classes at LCC.

The current class will be split into two classes, called Level 1 
and Level 2.  The official descriptions of these classes are 
here...

http://www.lanecc.edu/cont_ed/cont_ed/cc_menu_classes.html#10

... but thanks to insanely early deadlines the official 
descriptions are little more than guesses at what the Linux 
landscape was going to look like right about now.  What follows 
are more recent (and useful) descriptions of the two classes.

We're still following the Red Hat model for training, and now that 
we know what RH is doing with Enterprise Linux training & 
certification we're kinda sorta doing things that are similar.  

LEVEL ONE

The first-level class will cover what's needed to build, install, 
troubleshoot and maintain Linux workstations.  We won't do any 
server stuff at all except ssh and peer-to-peer file sharing with 
'doze boxen.

More details will be available after I create the syllabus 
(hopefully within the next week) but this is what I envision 
right now:

*	Basic Stuff that has been holding back some of the 
less-experienced students in my current classes, such as shell 
basics, grep & regular expressions and networking essentials.

*	Other basics such as filesystem structure and tools, process 
control, package management and local user & group management.

*	Basic host security.

*	Connecting workstations to various enterprise services such as 
NIS, NFS and so forth.  Yeah, I know they're lame but for some 
reason the certification testers are still requiring knowledge & 
experience in that stuff.  No, I don't get it either.  

I probably won't get around to Netware and LDAP interoperabilty 
this term but I hope to cover it in this course sometime in the 
future. I'm kind of waiting for the dust to settle around the 
Novell/SUSE thing.

Basically, Level One will cover most of the stuff needed for 
obtaining an RHCT.  It should be noted that LCC is not a 
Redhat-blessed training facility; we're only covering the topics, 
we're not preparing people to take the exam.

LEVEL TWO

The second-level class will cover most of the ground that is in 
the typical RHCE portion of a Redhat certification exam.  Again, 
this should not be construed as a class that will prepare anyone 
to actually sit for the exam, it's just a description of the 
topics that will be covered.

In this class we will build secure servers (and as much network 
infrastructure as can be done in the lab that we use):

Firewalls, routers, DNS and DHCP servers.  Web and mail (SMTP, POP 
and IMAP) servers.  NFS, NIS and Samba servers, including domain 
authentication for, and interoperability with, 'doze domains.  
Management of large numbers of machines.  And at some point 
(probably not this term), after we know what the Netware/Linux 
landscape is going to look like, hopefully Netware & LDAP 
interoperability.

More information will be available after I get the syllabus 
written, hopefully in the next week.

You can register on-line for either of these classes (or, if you 
know any newbies, for the "Intro to Linux" class) at LCC's 
website (lanecc.edu).  

Please feel free to forward this to anyone whom you think might be 
interested.  Any questions, just ask!

Thanks,

Ken

I've got to say... you lose about 25 points in my book when you base a
class entirely around a single distribution.  RedHat does too many
things that other distros don't to be considered 'The Linux' ... I,
personally, feel Slackware is about as close as you can get to a
non-special distribution, but I realize many people don't like it.  It's
easy to teach distribution-agnostic skills with such a distro, however.

I realize you're aiming specifically for RHCE stuff, and would probably
call it intro to RedHat Linux if you could put RedHat in the title of
the class, but I really just dislike classes calling themselves 'Linux'
classes when they are, in fact, RedHat classes.  Linux != RedHat.

Ok, since you're all stumped.  Let me ask this:

And... reading back over that... it sounds far more rude than I had

I *do* appreciate every little bit of time Linux gets in the classroom
or in the public.  Classes teaching people Linux, even
distribution-specific, are good things.  I appreciate Ken putting the
effort into getting these classes out there.  :-)

I just don't like the way it's so RedHat centric.

I apologize if I came off more negatively than I had originally
intended.

I agree completely. Red Hat Linux classes should be called what
they are. However, there's a downside. If a college only offers
Red Hat Linux classes and not generic Linux classes, this reinforces
the idea that Linux = Redhat. I would hope that the instructors
spend some time explaining this to students, as I do.

On my Debian system, there is a directory: /etc/gnome/panel-config that
seems to contain most of the system wide settings.  I haven't been able
to find any tmp files, nor can I think of a reason for there being any. 
I did find a file in my home directory called .gnome-errors that might
have some useful information in it.

Since you really haven't described how it is "fubared", I don't know
what else to say.

HTH a little anyway,

Try moving .gnome and/or .gnome2 out of your homedir. You'll lose your
settings, but you may gain stability.

Greetings,

I find "Directory Administrator" has the basic features I need, but
it requires X11. Something web-based or text-based would work better
for my circumstances. Any suggestions of packages to try would be

Although there's a much newer and revised tool about to come out (and
you can find via the SourceForge links, I'm sure), even the old
version is better than just about anything, IMO. (Which is really just
saying there isn't much competition, unfortunately.)

There's also a web-app somewhere out there that's plenty functional,
but I thought the interface was kinda clunky.

Subject: [PLUG] All-new All-different smbldap problem
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.52.0403091654480.9438@shaft.bitmine.net>

OK, so I've got some new ideas and started moving forward with my LDAP
configuration (from scratch, here).

I'm using these here smbldap scripts.

So dig this (from smbldap_conf.pm):
# Ex: $slaveLDAP = "127.0.0.1";
$slaveLDAP = "127.0.0.1";
$slavePort = "389";

# Master LDAP : needed for write operations
# Ex: $masterLDAP = "127.0.0.1";
$masterLDAP = "127.0.0.1";
$masterPort = "389";

The documentation explicitly says this is OK if you've only got the one
LDAP server (no way am I setting up two of these before I even know if it
works with one).

Yet:
brat:~# smbldap-groupadd.pl -a -g 200 "Domain Admins"
error LDAP: Can't contact slave ldap server (IO::Socket::INET: Bad
protocol 'tcp') at /usr/local/sbin//smbldap_tools.pm line 100.

How the hell can that be?

What's so bad about 'tcp' as a protocol?  Shouldn't these tools WORK?
What the heck is wrong with my configuration that it doesn't work when
nobody even mentions having this kind of problem with these tools?

OK, there's plenty of reference to this error... ON WINDOWS!

Oooh, a clock tower!  Where's my deer rifle?

Recent versions of Webmin have a module, but it kinda sucks.  I've had
one half-written for about 2 years now, but have never actually managed
to finish it.

That was fubared for awhile, but I got that back.  What is messed up is
the main menu launcher: When I click the start menu it
crashes, without displaying a menu.
Is there something else I should add?

Subject: [PLUG] Implementing only whitelisted allowed to stop spammers...
Message-ID: <1078882464.26612.108.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I've been thinking about the need to close the smtp port 
to spammers to really stop them where it would take a lot 
of research and a lot of iptables rules to block every 
single spammer. A lot of spam comes from innocent sites 
that have been infected by a worm or virus.  In the 
interest of processing time and aware that spamassassin 
isn't always effective, I'm considering blacklisting 
all addresses and maintaining a whitelist for each
user.

Graylisting is an option, but it may stop legitimate 
email since some servers won't retry.  

A perhaps less risky approach involves the use of a 
database and maybe some Perl script.  My idea is to 
pull the headers out of email from untrusted sources 
using Perl and update a running SQL database with them.  
The goal being, have a record of email headers for the 
purpose of helping local users update their white lists.  
All you need to see is the subject and the source to 
know if you want an email, email messages that aren't 
from white listed addresses can be processed so that 
the header is sent to the intended recipient in a new 
message with a special reply address when that address 
hasn't been encountered before.  If they delete this 
processed message instead of replying, they don't get 
the message and the source stays black listed.  They 
also don't get any virus or worm this way since they 
don't have the body yet.  This calls for all but one
email address that will be special to be black listed
for all senders initially.  It means finding out if
an attempt to transmit to the special address is being
made before SMTP gives the ok to send the message.

The biggest problem is how to make this work with a 
mailing list.  It requires white listing the address 
of every single person on that list.  The advantage 
is that I don't have to keep lists of the addresses 
of abusers where there are probably millions.  The 
computer would grind to a halt if I had a million 
ip tables rules to explicitly deny individual spam 
sites.

Ideally if SMTP can get who the sender will be and
the subject without allowing the remote site to
transmit the message body in cases of distrust
putting that information into a useful format, 
Perl won't be needed and this system can prove 
to be a vast improvement over local filtering
for spam and malware.  It changes the game to
on recipient request instead of on sender's 
whim.

I'm thinking about a special email address where
the recipient always gets a special message with just
the header of the sender's message, but that 
could be a royal pain.  The problem I'm trying to solve
over simple white listing and black listing is allowing
for growth by permitting new potential email sources
to send their email address by attempting to send an 
email in the normal way.

Ok, I'll bite.  I know that most people RTFM, but have you checked the Gnome
Administrator's Guide (Gnome2.x-system-admin-guide) (I didn't see a specific
version).  It is available from http://gnome.org/learn/.  I noticed in the
first few pages it references the gconf and gconfd applications, as well as
several others.

Further, in my environment (Red Hat 9), I have the following directories /
files in my home directory:

<d> .gnome
<d> .gnome2
<d> .gnome2_private
<d> .gnome_desktop
<d> .gnome_private
<f> .gtkrc-1.2-gnome2
<f> %gconf.xml

(where <d> represents a directory and <f> represents a file).

Exploring through these I see lots of options, but I see that there are a
lot of files in /etc/gnome-vfs-2.0/modules that you might want to look at as
well.

I hope that helps you......

Did you check for zombies or reboot the system?  I was cleaning up my
~/tmp directory the other day and deleted a directory full of sockets,
which 'lsof' told me were unused.  Well, lsof lied or I deleted
something else because any subsequent GNOME apps I started spewing
connecting errors wrt the ORB, so I logged out and forcibly restarted
the X server and then things became even stranger--text labels were
missing from the error message boxes I got (I could tell they were error
boxes based on the icons).  I switched back to a console shell and found
there were some zombied gnome-terms, so I killed their parents and any
other X clients I found and everything has been copacetic since.

1)  Folks have told you time and again... just use spamassassin.  It works
like freakin' magic and will take care of nearly every piece of garbage
you get.  It's been suggested a thousand times and you insist on doing
insane things to block messages instead of just using the one and only
method outside of shutting down mail services entirely that actually
WORKS.

2)  Try to write your messages without using the word "where" as a
conjunction.  If you don't quite understand why that's a grammatical
nightmare and aren't sure when you should or shouldn't use it, just don't
use it at all.  Try to go a week without typing the word "where".  I think
it would improve your communication immeasurably.  I'm serious about that.
Just don't use the word for a while.

How about creating an new user, does the menu launcher crash for a new
user?  This will at least let you know if you are dealing with a user
configuration or a system configuration.  I the new user works, then you
will have a working setup to copy files from.

Good luck,

Message-ID: <1078891470.5539.44.camel@dell.linux.box>

I've been having a lot of fun with UMLs here recently... I signed up
with Redwood Virtual for $5/month and also PigsCanFly (which has just
shut down their UML-providing service, shoving it off to JVDS.com)...

Looking at the JVDS website, I see they offer virtual FreeBSD servers. 
"Whoa!" I said to myself, "that sounds way cool."  I haven't emailed
them to ask them yet, but probably will once I have my server back up
and running with them... but does anybody know how they would do that? 
I would *love* to be able to run a little FreeBSD UML-type setup here in
Gentoo.  I googled it a month or three ago and found absolutely no
information at all.

Any thoughts?  :-)

In general, I'm not a huge FreeBSD fan, but I think it *would* be fun to
play with.  I have a shell account on one FreeBSD box I haven't really
played with much yet...

So has anybody heard of a UML-like solution for FreeBSD, preferably one
which runs with a Linux host?

I don't know what this has to do uniquely with Linux,
except that good communication benefits everyone.
"Where" is one of the most popular words to use when
(where?) a compound sentence occurs, and some
"plumbing" is obviously needed, but the writer is not
quite sure what to use. If (where) it is not really
the most appropriate term to use, greater clarity will
result from using a more appropriate one.

Will: I rebooted and it made no difference.
I created a new user and copied everything (using tar to /tmp, where I
changed owners and  from/tmp to new user)  (after completely clearing
out the new user home dir) It worked fine, except for bookmarks. Go
figure. I guess it must be something in uid.

OK. As others wrote, my first hunch is that you're not getting decent
DNS service at your remote locale. Usually, the version of ping that
ships with Linux systems will show you what IP address it's trying to
reach, e.g.,

  [heinlein at pecos heinlein]$ ping appl-ecosys.com
  PING appl-ecosys.com (216.99.206.23) 56(84) bytes of data.
  64 bytes from appl-ecosys.com (216.99.206.23): icmp_seq=1 [....]

When you're 105 miles from your LAN, does ping show you the IP address
you expect to see for appl-ecosys.com?

No, it doesn't.  My ISP is struggling with worms where a lot of
the stuff I'm getting does not filter and it's disingenuous of 
you to put political pressure on someone to filter trash that 
has no right to be on the Internet in the first place.  It 
shouldn't be filtered, it should be stopped.  Some 
stuff that filters with spamassassin and some doesn't.  
On a DSL connection, you need to discourage wasteful
SMTP traffic because you don't have much bandwidth in the first
place.  If you don't block spam from coming in, you don't 
discourage it.  Unfilterable, unstoppable, UCE is illegal in some
states.  Why do you assume I can filter it?  Do you think I'd
ask how to stop spam that I'm filtering successfully
on a list that has given me so many helpful suggestions?  

I take issue with the comment that everyone has told me just to
filter.  They haven't.  In fact there has been talk on here about
gray listing which I've used as a reference to look into it.  I
don't feel it's strong enough though.  The dynamic of you send me
email only if I want you to can't be established with filtering 
alone.  I don't have problems with taking an aggressive stance, 
trying to keep up with new filtering methods is absurd.
I find it offensive that someone manipulates my server to 
send me messages I don't want to hear.

As a Calc III student I can say with certainty that there is no such
thing as magic.  The filtering approach to spam is failing to address
the bandwidth loss issue and the intense pressure that worms, etc. 
are putting on mail systems.  A lot of drug ads are getting around, 
I guess drug companies feel the return on negative advertisement 
is worth the bad publicity and anger people will feel.

What are needed are Internet police and advertising rules that strictly
forbid methods that make it hard to filter UCE and other junk mail.  The
SMTP protocol needs to be retired because it was not designed for a
network the size of the Internet with so many hostile mail sources.

The other thing that Zot suggested once that _really_ helped me zero
in on a ssh problem was to run a debugging daemon at a random port,
and progressively invoke verbosity, strace and gdb to the daemon until
clarity is achieved.  One of the non-DNS possibilities is a key problem
(since they seem to be indexed by hostnames).

Since you say you can ssh to the IP number, you ought to be able to
arrange the daemon.  [Aside: You also said that "ssh -vv hostname"
hung after some messages, but didn't say what the messages were.
Those might be relevant and helpful.]

For a similar debugging session, see:  
  <http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/2003-December/027033.html>

which says, essentially:

  On the remote (server) host, run:

    # sshd -D -d -p 2222 > /tmp/debug-log 2>&1 &

  To attach strace (but skip this unless it proves necessary), use a
  command like:

    # strace -f -o /tmp/strace-sshd -p <pid-of-sshd-you-just-started>

  On the client, run:

    $ ssh -p 2222 -v <remote-hostname>

... then inspect /tmp/debug-log on the server host to achieve
enlightenment.  If this fails to bring the lightbulb you are looking
for, try again with the strace and look at the /tmp/strace-sshd you
thus created.

The port number 2222 is arbitrary (substitute your own if you prefer).

If your server host is hidden inside your network, you will need to
forward the port appropriately at the firewall.  Something like:

  # iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 2222 -j DNAT --to 192.168.xxx.yyy

where eth0 is assumed to be the firewall's external interface and
192.168.xxx.yyy is the internal address of the server host.

And then apply the universal Feynman Problem Solving Algorithm:

  1. write down the problem

  2. think real hard

  3. write down the answer

That's what I'd do, anyway.

Please list one that is a source of legitimate e-mail.

The real problem is that Spammers could work around it (needs more
processor, but with them using cracked machines this isn't a problem).

Yes, unfortunately, as Jeme mentioned in rather rude terms, so far
filtering has been the only successful approach.

You're worried about the bandwidth consumption of e-mail on DSL?! I
didn't realize it was possible to get 1kbps DSL.

I was almost going to agree and say nearly as hard as keeping M$ systems
up to date on patches, but then I realized it isn't anywhere near that
difficult. Near the same number of updates, but they're a heck of a lot
easier to deal with.

So do you report every piece of spam you get (including those that spam
assassin captures) to the ISPs involved?

Ha! Noticed how effective legislative methods have been at stopping spam?
Not effective at all. Certainly looks like SMTP is dealing with a network
the size of the Internet just fine, it still delivers mail just fine. I'm
not sure protocol changes could affect the problem anyway. There have
been suggestions of methods that would force processor consumption on the
source, but the spammers already have a way around that, the hords of
zombies they're already using.

I'm very surprised at this conclusion, but spamassassin is getting to be
so effective that some day we might actually defeat the spammers. Spam is
turning into gibberish in order to get past filters, how long until
humans won't understand it either?

That raised my eyebrows, too. On an awful day, say I
get 100 unwanted e-mails of 10K each. That's 1 MB
spread over the entire 24-hour period. I don't think
it will bog down my 640K connection. The judgment
exercised in sorting out messages with misleading
titles wastes a lot of time, though, and that's the problem.

Message-ID: <1078909755.1709.108.camel@alexlinux.qwest.net>

	Having a bit of trouble with a MDL9.1 install. This is my home webpage
server and it was working fine until tonight when I attempted to run top
to check how long it had been up since I replaced the harddrive a few
weeks ago. It told me that there had been a core dump.
	I checked my home files and found 4 dump files and decided to do a
restart. 
	At that point it came up with a root PW screen and then it only logged
me out but would not reboot and poking around I saw that one of my
partitions was no longer mounted.
	One shutdown and restart later and I saw the "touch: untouchable..."
messages start to appear.
	I am getting the partition to show up as clean but then am told that it
might be the wrong file system (ext3) or too many inodes but am unable
to mount to check for that. I can run fsck,ext3 forced or unforced and
it comes back clean every time. My fstab is correct also.
	What am I missing here? Have I maybe been hacked? Everything but this
one partition seems to be intact.

Hmm. Russell's suggestion about setting up a debugging sshd is a good
one, probably the first I'd try. Here are a couple other semi-wild
ideas:

1. Are you running nscd? (ps or pidof will show you.) If so, does
   stopping it and/or restarting it make a difference?

2. Is there any mention of appl-ecosys.com in /etc/hosts? If so, does
   removing it help? If not, does adding it help?

3. Same drill with /etc/resolv.conf (careful here, however, because it
   might be autogenerated by your dhcp client)

4. You mentioned earlier in this thread that "ssh -vv" tended to stop
   in the same place each time. Can you identify what's going on when
   it stops?

5. Have you tried wrapping ssh in strace to see what's up? E.g.,

     strace -o /tmp/ssh.trace ssh appl-ecosys.com

   Then have a look at the last entries in /tmp/ssh.trace to see which
   system calls are running when things fail.

I do, and everybody at ursine.ca gets less spam because of it.  You

But if you don't report your spam, spamassassin is only solving half

If you mean the "My Documents" folder on the Windows desktop, then I
believe the setting is made on the client side, not within Samba.

Absolutely correct. Right click the shortcut onthe win desktop, change
the location to \\server\share and you're off like a gallon of milk. You
might move their docs over from the local machine, too since most of win
users do not understand that the folder on their desktop is not actually
the my documents folder. 

My kids had their "my documents" on my redhat workstation for nearly a
year before they noticed.

You might also try putting an entry in /ect/hosts, and set /etc/nsswitch.conf to look there first, to see if that makes a difference. If it is the network, as opposed to sshd on the remote host, there is probably not a lot you can do about it.

I was hoping Samba could setup this association automatically in their

Okay- now I see. Samba is about the only software I know of that does
not have direct access to windows core components. (security joke)

Sounds like you need a registry hack to switch the desktop icon, and and
a batch file that moves the contents. I do not know where the registry
keeps the values for the shortcut, but you could search for and export
that part of the registry, tweak it for each user and then put it in
their share. Tell them to run (click on) them, adding the registry
values, assuming your win boxen are all the same flavor.

How many desktops are we talking about?

I did this (somehow) but it was a year ago and I don't remember what I
did.  Maybe it was the "logon home" parameter in smb.conf (but that's
just a wild guess).  I solved the problem with a manually executed
genetic algorithm: I kept reading stuff and trying things until the
fitness improved to acceptablility.  Whatever I did, "it" works now.

I have done this when the Samba machine is the domain controller.
This may be more elaborate than is necessary, but it works.

in smb.conf general section you put
logon script = logon.bat

the logon.bat file on the server in the netlogon share looks like
c:\windows\wscript  \\mypdcserver\netlogon\RegChange.VBS

and the RegChange.VBS looks like
-------------
Dim WSHShell
Set WSHShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
WSHShell.RegWrite "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\Start Page","http://www.google.com","REG_SZ"
-------------

You just have to substitute the correct registry key for the location of the "My Documents" folder
I think it will be this, 
WSHSHell.RegWrite "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders","\\server\share","REG_SZ"
but I have not tested it.

Then as each user logs on, their folder location gets changed.

You should make the file permissions on the RegChange.VBS and the logon.bat pretty tight.

This makes no sense to me:

IO::Socket::INET: Bad protocol 'tcp'

The only reference to this error I can find on the net is for Windows
systems.  I can't imagine what on Earth could be causing such a thing.

Surely there are thousands of people out there using the smbldap-tools
that come with the samba-doc package... so what gives?

Subject: [PLUG] CVS branching question
Message-ID: <031120040053.9429.49dd@comcast.net>

I'm working at my new job, happily slaving away for the man, when he asks me to check out a module from the cvs repository. So I do. Then he asks me to make it a branch of my very own. So I do. Following the instructions in this cvs document...

http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_toc.html
and specifically this section:
http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_5.html#SEC51

The docs say that this "branch creation" is sticky; and so I won't need to play with it until we merge again. However, I've created a new file and added it (cvs add filename) to the branch and then committed it (cvs commit filename). And now, if I look at the directory with my new-found-friend Cervisia (a graphical front end to cvs) it has tags for all the files with my branch name _except_ the file I added and committed, which implies that the new file I added is on the trunk rather than on my branch.  

So the question I have is -- did I do it >wrong?< 

And this CVS thang is really cool- I can see using it with "wordpress" (blogware tool at wordpress.org) to make my changes and keep my changes in place with their updates (because I"m running an old version and I'd like to upgrade but ... well... you get the idea).   I was using RCS before, so I'm not a version-systeming virgin, but CVS is a sweet sweet love.

Your help is, as always, appreciated.

You did it right. All the files have been branched except the file you added, which you need to explicitely branch, since it was not present when you created the branch tag for the existing files. CVS is very cool :)

The stickyness applies to file that have already been branched. After you branch the new file the stickyness will apply to that file as well.

...so I emailed my WinXP guru, who said:

When you have an active dialup connection and "Log Off" you are met with
a box that says...
 
"The dialup networking connection "xxx" is currently active.  Would you
like to close the connection  Yes/No"
 
This is true with a standard dialup connection, not so with AOL. The AOL
program closes when you log off.
 
If you just "Switch Users" without logging off then even AOL will
provide the other user profiles with Internet access, since the programs
running on the original profile do not close.

I tried several today. A buggy lot it was.

The workable web-based one I found is phpLDAPadmin. I think I'll go with that
if nothing drastically better comes along. I'm still looking for good shell
utilities. There's a set called UserTools that looks promising based on
the description. Maybe tomorrow.

What do you want done?  I can make it subscriber-post-only, although it
doesn't particularly seem to be used much.

You won't find old packages for testing.  Daily sid snapshots are
archived at snapshot.debian.net.  Why would you ever need snapshots
for testing?  Sid and testing aren't meant for production...

  The BizJournal must be expecting a _huge_ crowd because it will be held at

$25 each if purchased by March 25th. If there are enough interested -- and

On that same day and in the same place, I'll be conducting two
Linux and FOSS sessions at the Innotech show. These are geared
for business people. If PLUGgers know people that just don't
see the wisdom in switching some of their computing away from
Windows, send them to these sessions and let me have a shot at
them.

Ed,

  I'm certain it's no coincidence that the breakfast is there and a
half-hour later than usual. A new sponsor of these events emerged this year:
Microsoft. You know those folks, they're the ones who brag, "Your
productivity. Our profit." Sigh.

I'm not using them for production.  Just the home thing.  But recently
debian rolled out the new net-snmp and it has changed the way some MIBs
are presented.  So now within Cricket I cannot monitor stable and
testing boxes within the same tree.  I will either need to regress the
snmpd package or rebuild the tree.  I'm more inclined to regress the
package.

Russell, et al.:

  I'll have to try to work this out at the clinic in a couple of weeks. I
don't know of a place I can plug in locally to test why the IP address works
but the domain name doesn't.

  Yes, I realize that. But, I didn't copy them to a text file at the time.
When I have an opportunity to plug in remotely again I'll make note of these
messages and let everyone know.

  Thanks, Matt. I just ordered (from amazon) a 3Com 3CRWE154G72. I hope it
won't be a hassle to identify the requisite drivers.

Have you looked here:

  <ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/n/net-snmp/>

Also, I don't use it enough to remember exactly how it works, but I
believe that you can specify version numbers to the apt tools.

I have no idea what's wrong here.

I've created a sambausers, sambamachines, and sambaadmin groups.

I've created a handful of system users with /bin/false as their shell and
sambausers as their primary group (one of which is called
"administrator").

I've added a subset of these to the sambaadmin group ("administrator" is a
member of that subset).

I then ran `net groupmap add ntgroup="Domain Admins" unixgroup=sambaadmin`.

I've created an account for a machien.  The account name ends in a $.

For each of the members of sambausers, I have run `smbpasswd -a` with
their username as the final argument and added a password.

And yet, when I attempt to configure a W2K machine to join the domain, it
fails.  When it is the machine for which I have already created a machine
account, it still asks for a username and password "with permission to
join the domain".  I give it the administrator username and password and
it comes back with a logon failure.

What gives?  Next steps?

Two days behind schedule and desperate -

I had this trouble with a Win2000 machine once and it had something to
do with the Win machine not the Samba Server. Is it all W2k machines or
one in particular?  Anyway it turned out the W2k machine had a Samba
sign on to a the same Samba server with a different directory.  The old
sign on tried at boot to use the out of date info to sign on and failed
because that directory no longer existed.
Problem was solved when w2k was reinstalled(school machine; they just
write preconfigured system to all the machines).

No way around it these days.  I'll bet it eats up a fair amount of

Looks like someone's infected Windows box has Zot's contact information!
Did yesterday's "important" monthly security patch from Microsoft cover
this?

I've been meaning to talk to Dave about letting me change the MX records
and Exim config so mail for pdxlinux.org routes through my Mail Defender
server.  Until now my main impetus has been to make list moderation
easier for myself, since 95% of the messages that get held for
moderation are spam.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0403111623180.27780@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  On my Slackware-9.1 notebook xpdf sometimes cannot find the appropriate
fonts to display a document. I've not before encountered this problem on my
other systems. Perhaps I don't have enough fonts loaded on the new machine.

  Has anyone else encountered this? I see messages such as "cannot create
freetype for ..." or "cannot find ... font".

Thanks,

Yet another comcast spew from c-24-20-71-51.client.comcast.net
Though the messasage ID was rather suspicious.
I would think for this list, sending messages with exe, pif, etc...
attachments straight to /dev/null would be a non-issue.  (And password
protected zips as well)

That would be cool.  Drizzle *was* running AMaViS a while back (Karl set
it up)...  I see it is still running now, but if it isn't catching spam,
something is amiss.

Your Mail Defender server kills those stupid password protected zips,
right?  :-)

While you're in there playing with DNS... I remember a few years back
y'all were looking for slave DNS servers.  I have a UML server in
California and one in Michigan now, both running BIND 9 (both at colo
facilities with "100Mbps burstable connections").  It would take me but
a few moments to add the lines to my named.conf for y'all, if you want
more backups.  Ping them at uml.axpr.net and uml.no-ip-here.net if you
wish.

OK, so I got smbclient to allow to connect to a share on the localhost as
a samba only user.  That seemed like success.

But still, when any of the W2K machines tries to join the domain, I get
"Logon failure: invalid username or bad password" (or very similar words).

I would think that I had an authentication issue with the samba server,
but that's clearly not the case because I can authenticate with smbclient.

Perhaps W2K is using a different authentication scheme?  That seems wrong.

Gah.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0403111705470.13738@sco302.DavidMandel.com>

Hey,

    What do people use for drawing network diagrams, organization
charts, and the like?  The tools I have used for this do the job, but 
are slow and clumsy to use.  

    My students have introduced me to MS Visio and at first glance it 
seems pretty nice - except that it runs under Windows which is slow and 
clumsy to use.

    So, is there any equivalent to MS Visio (preferably Open Source)
that runs under Linux or some other Unix OS?

                                          Sincerely,

Did you try dia?

I've only used it a few times, but it was fairly quick and painless for
diagrams.

Dave,

  I have identified at least 7 vector drawing programs for linux. The one I
like (and use for the illustrations in my book) is 'tgif'. Others include
xfig, dia, sketch, ipe and a couple of more whose names I forget. Oh, ...
one's called 'grace'.

Here's my smb.conf:

[global]
workgroup = testdomain
netbios name = Samba
server string = Samba PDC
domain master = yes
domain logons = yes
wins support = yes
interfaces = eth1 172.16.1.10
bind interfaces only = true
socket options = IPTOS_LOWDELAY TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192
add user script = /usr/sbin/useradd -m %u
delete user script = /usr/sbin/userdel -m %u
add group script = /usr/sbin/groupadd %g
delete group script = /usr/sbin/groupdel %g
add user to group script = /usr/sbin/usermod -G %g %u
add machine script = /usr/sbin/useradd -s /bin/false -d /dev/null %u
logon path = \\%L\Profiles\%u
logon drive = H:
logon home = \\%L\%U
os level = 65
idmap uid = 15000-20000
idmap gid = 15000-20000
hosts deny = all
hosts allow = 172.16.1. 127.0.0.1
obey pam restrictions = yes
force create mode = 0777
force directory mode = 0777
force security mode = 0777
force directory security mode = 0777

[netlogon]
comment = Network Logon Service
path = /var/lib/samba/netlogon
admin users = root,m
guest ok = yes
browseable = no

[Profiles]
comment = Roaming Profile Share
path = /var/lib/samba/profiles
read only = no
profile acls = yes


I create a Linux user account on the Samba box and add that user to the
smbpasswd file "smbpasswd -a <username>".  Then on the Win2K box, I change
it to the Samba domain (after it prompts me for a domain admin/pass),
reboot, and then login to the Win2K box with one of the users I created on
the Samba box in the domain.  So I never add the machine accounts to the
Samba server directly.  This is handled for me when I change the client to
the new domain using the 'add machine script' section of smb.conf.
I still need to understand what's going on with the profiles directories
better because the only way I could get profile information to be saved
after a user logged out was to force the permissions to be wide open on
the server.  Hopefully I can lock this down soon as I learn more about how
this works.

If your Window Manager is smart like mine us, you can hold down your ALT

Rob,

  Sigh. Why do I always forget this? Perhaps because these things happen at
the end of a busy day and my NPU is dropping bits.

  Thanks for the reminder!

Some options:

     -  Shrink from the top, then move it up (I don't think this
        actually works in this case).
     -  up your res. to be > than 768 vertical (obviously not an
        option all the time..)
     -  up the res and use a virtual desktop (gets arround the issue
        above)
     -  Change WM's temporarily (Enlightenment supports the
        alt-movement)
     -  Create two or more desktops (or workspaces--terminology changes
        based on WM) such that windows span from one to the other.
     -  drop in an extra video card an use xinerama to spread your
        desktop across both cards (orient the screens vertically).
           Note that this does _not_ require two monitors.
     -  I imagine you could copy your .acrobat or .adobe or whatever
        from another computer and restart acrobat.
     -  There may be an accessability tool that could help, or a
        keyboard sequence that lets you select the "accept" button
        w/out seeing it.


Hope something works, I've had this issue in the past, but I've always
had an enlightenment install arround.  By the way, gnome/kde have long
ago passed E in terms of required resources.. at least untill dr17 is
released ;).

For Visio-like network diagrams, I'd have to second Jeme's nomination
of dia. I've used it more than a few times and it's very similar /
very nice.

XCircuit is intended to be a schematic layout and capture app, but it
works pretty good as a general-purpose drawing program, too. It saves
the files it creates as PostScript.

I've always found dia frustrating to use, and xfig downright
excruciating.

I get dozens, sometimes hundreds, of pieces of spam per day from my
comcast account. I rarely see any of them.

1. Grab your mail using fetchmail. Comcast supports POP over SSL, so
   you can encrypt your session if you so desire. Here's a
   ~/.fetchmailrc snippet:

   poll mail.comcast.net proto pop3
     user "remote-you", with password "password", is "local-you" here,
     ssl,
     sslfingerprint "86:4B:ED:3A:64:CE:70:D4:56:C1:DE:57:C6:92:AC:19"

2. Using procmail (or sieve or whatever), feed all inbound mail to
   SpamAssassin 2.63. Here's a ~/.procmailrc recipe:

   # scan all inbound messages under 200K in size for spam
   :0fw
   * < 200000
   | /usr/bin/spamassassin

   # send spam to spam folder
   :0
   * ^X-Spam-Flag: YES
   .spam/


   For better performance, read up on using spamd/spamc instead of the
   the spamassassin script.

3. Season SpamAssassin to taste in ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs:

   # See 'perldoc Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf'
   required_hits      4.00
   use_bayes          1
   bayes_min_spam_num 100

For the libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3, you'll need the compatability rpm:

  compat-libstdc++-6.2-2.9.0.16.i386.rpm

The gd and png libraries are easy to find:

  gd-1.8.4-4.i386.rpm
  libpng-1.0.14-0.7x.4.i386.rpm

I'm a bit unsure of which openssl package will satisfy the *.so.2
dependencies; it'll be one of the following:

  openssl-0.9.6b-35.7.i386.rpm
  openssl095a-0.9.5a-23.7.3.i386.rpm
  openssl096-0.9.6-23.7.i386.rpm

All of these packages are available via the Fedora Legacy site:

  http://download.fedoralegacy.org/redhat/7.3

Original release rpms are in the os/ directory; later fixes are in the
updates/ tree.

Sorry - to add more information.  I haven't had enough coffee yet.

I get the same errors from png and gd and I also have installed the
openssl package which is supposed to solve the crypto and ssl
dependency.

My problem here is that I am told a dependency and then try to install
it and it says installed.  

Sorry for making y'all guess at my intentions.

Just a quick question... 

Why are you installing php-4.1.2-7.3.6.i386.rpm when the latest is
php-4.3.4-1.1.i386.rpm?

I assumed he was working on a Red Hat 7.3 system, but I suppose it'd
be worthwhile if Cam confirmed that. :-)

- This is a Redhat 9 install.  Real basic.  Acting as a mail gateway
(Postfix-Amavisd-Spamassassin-Clam) but I would like to add web
capability.
- I tried to build from source apache 2 and the latest PHP. Followed
instructions on how to compile with php, etc 
- My compiles and everything worked fine except my php scripts would not
run. I would get the script text at my site (http://mysite) or if I
explicitely typed the php (http://mysite/index.php) it would prompt me
to download.
- I read on some boards that PHP is unstable with Apache 2, so I decided
to back-off and load Apache 1.39(?). 
- So I went back to RPM's and installed Apache 1.3x and went to install
lated PHP
- Latest PHP has a dependency to an Apache 2 (httpd-mmn ....) so I have
been trying to install earlier versions of php as a base and then figure
out how to step up to later versions.

I guess my question is should I scrap it all?  Uninstall the rpm's to
this point and go with the latest RPM's for Apache and PHP?  Where can I
get the latest RPM's.  I have not found the latest on Fedora or Redhat
download sites?

Personally I try to go with the latest stable version or the update to get
rid of the "EVIL BUGS" which lurk there. php-4.3.4-1.1.i386.rpm can be found
on Fedora... And I imagine the latest Apache also...

What do you think Paul?

The problem is that you were trying to install a package built for Red
Hat 7.3. You'll need the php-* packages for Red Hat 9. Head to a
decent mirror, e.g.,

  ftp://limestone.uoregon.edu/redhat/updates/9/en/os/i386/

and grab the php-* rpms. Try those instead.

Feh. PHP works fine with the Apache 2.x packages shipped with Red Hat
9. Try those thoroughly before doing anything out of the ordinary.

Sorry if I am spamming but today is issue reolution day:

My crontab looks like this:

----------------------------
Problem - Neither jobs are running.  I don't know what I did because
they worked a while back when I was installing stuff and testing.

I have a customer that needs a software product certified on that

Everything looks ggod in the logs. I just added a PATH: statement at the
top of my crontab and it seems to be working now. Why?????  I guess what
is disconcerting is that sometimes I get e-mail for the sa-learn
portion, and most of the time not.  I get no e-mail for the
queue-cleanup, but I will have to look at my perl script.

I guess we can table this discussion for now.  Thanks for the help.

The problem is that you were trying to install a package built for Red
Hat 7.3. You'll need the php-* packages for Red Hat 9. Head to a decent
mirror, e.g.,

  ftp://limestone.uoregon.edu/redhat/updates/9/en/os/i386/

and grab the php-* rpms. Try those instead.

Feh. PHP works fine with the Apache 2.x packages shipped with Red Hat 9.
Try those thoroughly before doing anything out of the ordinary.

Could it be libpng-1.2.2 provides libpng.so.1 and not libpng.so.2?

Google... perhaps there is a different libpng version you need to
install.

I really think the best route for you, however, would be to just build
the derned thing from source.  There was a dude in an irc channel a week
or three ago who was having a similar problem with his RH box.  He
needed to upgrade PHP badly.  None of the RPMs worked for him... he
couldn't get them working, either.  Just couldn't satisfy the
dependencies.

I suggested he just compile the thing from source.  It worked like a
charm.

What version of Red Hat are you running?  What version of Red Hat did
you get the httpd, php, libpng, and gd packages that you are trying to
install?  Try doing "rpm -q httpd php libpng gd".   

You can also investigate the dependencies manually: "rpm -q --provides
libpng" tells you what libpng provides.  "rpm -qp --requires
gd-1.8.4-4.i386.rpm" tells you what the package requires.  "rpm -q
--whatprovides libpng.so.2" tells you if anything provides that
dependency.

You might want to install yum or apt.  They do the dependency
resolution and download the packages.  I use the versions from
http://freshrpms.net/.

Well, the "link below" assumed you were running Red Hat 7.3, since you
were trying to install a package built specifically for that
distribution.

Here are the packages I'm running on a Red Hat 9 web server:

  httpd-2.0.40-21.9
  php-4.2.2-17.2
  gd-1.8.4-11
  libpng-1.2.2-16

And here are the packages you tried to install:

I don't know about the gd-1.8.4-4 package. I'm using -11.

Here's what I see when I ask the gd package what it sort of png-ish
stuff it requires:

  [heinlein]$ rpm -qR gd | grep -i png
  libpng12.so.0

I don't see anything about libpng.so.2. Are you sure that the gd
package you've downloaded is intended for Red Hat 9?

I haven't seen a binary distro out there yet that doesn't have some very
messed up dependencies.  Source distros still have a few messed up
dependencies, but far fewer than any binary distro.

The whitelist in spamassassin user_prefs? I know there's SAManager
which is a web-based front-end for that (PHP); www.samanager.com
If you mean another whitelist it could probably be easily tweaked
to edit the appropriate file.

Subject: [PLUG] more cvs confusion
Message-ID: <031220042243.16100.4c14@comcast.net>

My new love, CVS, is sobbing incoherently. Perhaps some more help from a CVS porn star would help =)

Scenario:
I have checked out from the repository, and branched my changes (using cvs tag -b javascript). Now, I've edited the index.php file, and I've tried to commit it, and it won't commit to my javascript branch (and so, natcherally, I fubarred the trunk's index.php, to the consternation of all). And I've gone on to add a directory (/jscript) but when I try to commit the files in that directory, either manually or with cervisia, the branch names do not "take" the javascript tag. 

In fact, the version numbers on the jscript directory look like "1.1" rather than "1.2.1.2" -- but that's just because I wrote the whole shebang and committed it rather than checking and rechecking the files. But, since these files are part of the branch, shouldn't they look like the (magic version number) 1.1.1.1 - having 4 places?

I can fix the index.php issue; but how do I convince cvs to put the /jscript directory in the javascript branch and not in the trunk? The RCS/Entries file doesn't even have the "javascript" tag at the end of the lines.

If you do a cvs status on the files in this directory, do the files show that they are from the javascript branch? If not, do a "cvs update -r javascript" to update them to the branched version. Then edit index.php and check it in. To undo the fubarred index.php on the trunk you can run "cvs admin -o 1.x index.php". This command will delete version 1.x from the repository. BE CAREFUL WITH "cvs admin -o"!!!

You are correct about the version numbers, but these should only be seen after a commit has taken place on the branch, until then you will see things like 1.3 or 1.8. After a commit on the branch you will see somethink like 1.3.1.1 and 1.8.1.1. I seem to remember that one must first create the branch with "cvs tag -b", then update to the branch with "cvs update -r" before the file in the local sandbox have the branches sticky tag.

In CVS directories are not version, so there is no way to tell CVS that the directory goes on the branch. You must brach the file and then update to the branch. Run "cvs status" to be sure that the branch sticky tag shows up before you edit and commit.

Based on the feedback given to me this morning, I backed off the 1.3 and
went to this link and downloaded the recent packages from there, which
are NOT the latest versions, but a later than what I had installed.  I
will try the suggestions below:

  httpd-2.0.40-21.9
  php-4.2.2-17.2
  gd-1.8.4-11
  libpng-1.2.2-16

I am running into the problem now with gd and libpng - httpd went in
fine.

Thanks,

Cam

Feh. PHP works fine with the Apache 2.x packages shipped with Red Hat 9.
Try those thoroughly before doing anything out of the ordinary.

Well, the "link below" assumed you were running Red Hat 7.3, since you
were trying to install a package built specifically for that
distribution.

Here are the packages I'm running on a Red Hat 9 web server:

  httpd-2.0.40-21.9
  php-4.2.2-17.2
  gd-1.8.4-11
  libpng-1.2.2-16

And here are the packages you tried to install:

I don't know about the gd-1.8.4-4 package. I'm using -11.

Here's what I see when I ask the gd package what it sort of png-ish
stuff it requires:

  [heinlein]$ rpm -qR gd | grep -i png
  libpng12.so.0

I don't see anything about libpng.so.2. Are you sure that the gd package
you've downloaded is intended for Red Hat 9?

OK, I noticed something just now that I hadn't before: libpng.so.2 is
provided by the libpng10 package; that's probably the one you need to
install to get gd installed.

Hmm, yes, the status command does not show them to be in the correct place.
To force them to be in the javascript branch, I'm echoing a blank line to them and then putting them where they go. It seems to be working. :)

Subject: [PLUG] Real time screen capture
Message-ID: <20040312235740.GB26514@gate.kl-ic.com>

Are there any applications that do real-time full-motion screen capture
for X-Windows displays, perhaps over the network?  I would like to be
able to run an animation, or show something being typed, and capture 
what it does to a file, without slowing down the machine, but also 
without smoothing over the irregularities and jerkiness of the rendering.
There is probably a big Heisenberg factor here, and I am probably out
of luck, and instead should just feed the VGA output into a dedicated
recorder.  Still...

I would like to apply this to live computer demos that are part of
presentations.  Rather than have everyone watch while I laboriously set
up that particular bit of a demo, it would be handy to show video clips
of the demonstration instead, edited for brevity, and capable of being
stopped to point things out.  Video clips used that way would really
speed up and smooth out a presentation.   

But again, that may be asking too much.

Ideas?

Keith

There used to be a few different ways to record VNC sessions... one
which was used for a test at tightvnc.com, but it is no longer mentioned
there.  Google says http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bsd/vncrecording.html might be
able to do the job for you.

There are utilities to export an existing X session out over VNC.

That should do the trick for you.  That's how *I* would go about it, not
knowing of better alternatives.

dpkg doesn't allow screwed up things like dependencies on a particular
file, and folks making .debs tend to follow Debian guidelines instead
of making up their own package names and standards.  Therefor, any
.deb, any distro.  None of that retarded "It's a Red Hat package that
only works on Mandrake" bullshit.

Thank all of you who responded to my question.
It looks like either dia or xfig would work, but neither of them are
any where close to as nice and smooth as Visio.  The main differences
are that:

         -  Visio seems to have better clip art
         -  Visio allows one to attribute objects in a meaningful
            manner.  (Of course, Visio doesn't allow one to do 
            anything useful with these attributes.)

Of course, these conclussions are based on limited experience with
dia and extremely limited experience with Visco.  

On the other hand, I use to use xfig a certain amount in my former
life in GIS.  It works pretty well, but is far from perfect.  I did
remember that it had clip art objects in it.  I guess I never used
these.


Anyway,

                                                     Thanks,
                                                     Dave

Message-ID: <1079174357.21283.10.camel@x1-6-00-40-f4-82-41-d5>

ok so I am running suse 9.0 for my self, winXP for my family, and I want
to add debian to the mix. All of this is on one hard drive. I have not
installed debian yet I was wondering if anyone has any advice. 

How could I make this happen?

I have my /home directory on its own partition. so that makes things a
bit easier. I would like to keep suse as an option at boot time until I
test out woody a little bit to see if it will fit my needs.

I want to stick with stable releases for now so that means woody. It was
released in 2002. So that seems like it may be a problem but I have
heard a lot of good things about debian even before I figured out what
the shell prompt was. 

Any thoughts?

Anyway I have the flu right now so I hope this makes sense and I don't
get the "how to ask a intelligent question FAQ" link

Keith,

  Have you tried escaping the entire newline sequence: \\n?

RPM repositories have come a long way in the past couple years. Both
yum and apt are superior tools for non-trivial rpm installations and
upgrades.

At work, I now point most Red Hat and Fedora boxes at a local
yum-ified repository, and package updates/installations work just as
smoothly as they do on the Debian boxes I've got at home.

Dave,

With a little work you can make your own objects. Dia uses XML to
describe its objects.  Modify the supplied objects as you like and make
your own library.

Dia's data is stored in compressed ascii if you are interested in bit
fiddling.

Hi Russ-

I have copies of 4.1, 4.3 and 4.5 but no 4.2. I don't know if that will
do you any good. Let me know if that will help you at all.

Does anyone have a copy of FreeBSD 4.2 lying around?

I have a customer that needs a software product certified on that

download.

Thanks!

I found a mirror site with 4.2 iso images.  That might work better for

Happy hunting.

  Got this one resolved, too. Xpdf was looking for fonts in a non-existent
directory. So, making a symlink from the directory where they are located to
the directory xpdf wanted to use fixed the problem. It's been reported to
the support team at Slackware.

Vim will do the right thing, I think.  I usually just hit the Enter
key.  Vim also recognizes some meta-characters, like <cr>, hm, but
apparently not in ex commands.

I'd *guess*, but not know for sure, that Graybar would have it.

That might have been my thread you are recalling, and that was a *long*
while ago.

I ended up going to Greybar Electric per a suggestion from someone on the
list and found what I wanted. Their PDX location is on NE 60th next to I-84.
The corporate web site is www.greybar.com.

I think I also browsed some equipment catalogs in a Platt Electric office
but they didn't have quite what I wanted at the time. And the particular
office I visited was pretty clueless about computing-related equipment.
That's going to vary from one office to another. Plus again, it was a long
time ago. Things change.

Message-ID: <20040313001858.21516.qmail@post.phpwebhosting.com>



I am trying to set up ssh to allow root logins on a redhat 6.2 box (I am well aware of the security issues, we have our reasons).  I changed the sshd_config to PermitRootLogin yes and restarted the sshd server.  Still I can log in as a normal user and I can su from a normal user.  I checked the permissions on /root/.ssh they are set at 700 (which I believe is correct).  

Also one more interesting thing, perhaps this is relevant.  If I set it up with authorized_keys from another machine, I can log in without a password as root (however ths is really not what we need). 

Google turned up little to no help at all. Has anyone seen this or have any idea why root logins are still denied.  What am I missing?!

  There was a place on SE Macloughlin mentioned. And, as far as I know, you
can give a rack any name you want, just like a hostname.

There are usually (as of a year ago, when I drove by daily) several
sitting out in the rain at 5040 SE Milwaukie Ave.  I presume these are
intended as advertising for others that are kept under relatively
consistently dry conditions.

I would like to put some of my machines in a rack, as tower boxes are
bulky and disorganized, but the thing that is the real sticking point
for me is the inability to find rackmount ATX enclosures (say 3 or 4U)
for less that multiple hundreds of smackers.  A rack without ATX
enclosures would be pointless, and thus no further progress has been
made in that direction.

Russell,

  Why not build a rack version of LOBOS? That's Lots Of Boxes On Shelves?
With shelves on the racks you can stack 'em high and stack 'em wide.

Adding Debian to SuSE's boot loader might be best,
assuming that you use NTLDR to boot either XP or
Linux. Then selecting Linux from NTLDR's menu would
lead to another choice, from GRUB, of SuSE or Debian.

Microsoft has also produced Virtual PC 2004 for XP
Pro, which might be more convenient but probably would
not perform as well as a native installation.

well from my understanding the partition table for all systems is on
hda1. I also have my winxp on the same hda1. All my linux partitions are
on higher number partitions. 

So I want to get rid of windows. If I delete my hda1 partition with the
linux fdisk program it seems like I would destroy my partition table and
lose my ability to get into my linux system. 

what would be the best way of becoming free of windows with out killing
my linux system in the process.

thanks for responding. I decided to just get rid of windows for now and
postpone the debian install until I get a CD-RW drive. See my other

I'd think you should be able to re-format the Windows partition from
within Linux and then just use it as bonus hard drive space. This ought
to work fine if you don't feel the need to rearrange everything after
removing Windows. AFAIK, Linux doesn't really care what the type the
freshly wiped partition is marked as.

  To add to what Paul wrote: if you use fdisk (or cfdisk), as root and on a
console, you can change the filesystem type of /dev/hda1 to 83 (linux) while
keeping it as the bootable partition. However, you'll need a mount point for
it and most distributions (well, at least Red Hat and Slackware) want to put
/ on /dev/hda1.

  What would most likely turn out to be the quickest, easiest and least
frustrating would be to back up everything you want, repartition the drive
and re-install the OS. If the partition was anything but /dev/hda1 I think
you'd find it a lot easier.

Grab a second hard drive, move your installation to it.  Use the Hard

Do "host 66-42-36-140.sttl.dial.netzero.com" (or nslookup or dig or
whatever's appropriate) and it'll return an ip address. Then do "host
xx.xx.xx.xx" on that ip address. If they don't match, the isp is doing
something wrong, or someone who controls their reverse lookup was
trying to take advantage of host-based authentication (which you
shouldn't do anyways) to break in. If they do match, your DNS server
may have had a hiccup, or they "cleaned up their act". The benign
answers (incompetent isp and dns hiccup) are, unfortunately, the most
likely answers. ("Unfortunately", in that it's a bit like Chicken
Little.)

I didn't use google and the solution wasn't that great.  For
typing up equations something else would be better.   It
was finding an obscure menu and copying the desired character
out, it looks okay though.

Sarcasm isn't a virtue, there's nothing wrong with not
wanting to browse a search engine all the time.  Think 
spam's bad, you can easily google into far worse.  A 
solution out on an unpredictable internet is not a 
secure one.  The Internet we're so fond of is turning 
into a mass bingo ditch.  I like to stay out of ditches
when I can.

I don't have any rack mountable boxes either, but I would like a way to 
enclose my loud-ish computers into a cabinet which will muffle the sound 
somewhat and my girlfriend would like to not see all the wiring that a 
half dozen or so computers requires.  Other enclosures would fit that 
bill but a rack cabinet will also allow me to mount a rack mounted 
computer or two should one be in my future.

Also, if you are considering getting rackable cases you can find a few 
3U and 4U ATX for only 1.5 hundred dollars or less at newegg.com.

Thanks for the note but I might be in a different price bracket than 
Greybar or Platt - and are Greybar and Platt friendlier to their

If you are on a tight budget but have some time, then consider some
surplus solutions.  The Tektronix RAMS (recycle and material salvage)
store often has 19 inch racks.   The Tek store is open on Thursdays
from 2 until 5, call ahead.  There might also be some racks at Wacky
Willie's.

But a better way to go is a small modification of Rich's suggestion,
LOBOS, lots of boxes on shelves.   Rather than fixed shelves, get
some of those wire-shelf on roller pole systems ( www.metro.com).
This means you can move the system up against the wall, or turn it
around to work on.  The open-wire shelves are nice to wire-tie cables
and power strips and hubs to.  If you can't find these racks used at
one of the surplus places above, they are expensive new.  There are
very expensive but pretty versions at Storables;  but you can go there
and see some of what is available.  In any case, these might be the
way to go for stacks of odd sized boxen.

Word processors weren't designed for typing up things like math papers,

Better look at the response you received.  I see a *ton* of sarcasm in

There is something wrong with utilizing a mailing list as a personal
search engine, I think.  If the answer was that easily obtainable, why
even waste the time posting here in the first place?  Regardless of
whether or not it is 'right' to ask stupid questions here, it just
doesn't make much sense if googling is *faster*...

Yup, that is evil. "PermitRootLogin nopw" is insufficient for your

on the target system. If the solution is obvious do it, if not asking

Useful data point, but pretty much useless without the logs.

I am on a budget but it's not super tight, time is a slight issue too.

I checked the NW Wacky Willy's and the one they had currently was too 
"rough" for my tastes, it's doubtful I'll make it out to their westside 
location.  I'd forgotten about the Tek store, I'll have to give them a call.

I'm a huge metro shelving fan, they provide half of the total storage in 
my kitchen and allow me to roll around the TV along with 200lbs of AV 
equipment in the basement with something approaching ease - but I'm 
looking to go fully enclosed now for  noise and aesthetic reasons.

No, the partition table isn't stored on a partition, it is stored in a
special set of sectors that are not included in any partition scheme.

Good move, getting rid of windows lets in lots of fresh air.  Deleting
hda1 won't delete any other partitions, but it will delete the windows
boot loader.  This may or may not be a problem, depending on how your
linux boot loader is configured.  If it is configured to load from the
master boot record (/dev/hda and not /dev/hda?) then you should have no
problems.

There is no real answer to this question, you have lots of options.  The
"best" way depends on how your boot loader is configured, what you want
to do with the partition, how the rest of the drive is partitioned, and
how much free space you have left on those other partitions.

Good Luck,

I have LOTS of this style of shelving.  Some of it is from Storables and
some of it is genuine Metro stuff (culled from dumpsters and garage sales
and the like).

I can attest that they are highly compatible (the desk at which I sit now
has a Metro 36x24 shelf and a Storables 36x24 sliding shelf on Storables
vertical supports)... but it's not 100%.  Basically, you can mix the
shelving all you want and all the accessories work perfectly with the
latest Storables stuff (some of their old shelves had lengthwise grills
instead of width-wise) and classic, unchanging Metro stuff, but for a
given shelf, you have to choose either Metro or Storables (I forget their
upstream vendor's name) poles.  While they are both marked at 1"
increments, there are little double-bumps every five inches on the
Storables poles that makes perfect alignment impossible above five inchess
off the ground.

Anyway, I've got piles of this stuff (all in use and almost always
wanting/needing more) and heaps of experience with the various little
bits, so I'm surely going overboard here.

FWIW-I use Gorilla Racks. Not rollable, and not horribly attractive,
but you can put a zillion pounds on them, and if you hit the sales at
Freddie's just right, you can get a full 18x36x72 unit for $25.

Home Depot has some of this stuff in stock too, seems like it was less
expensive than Storables (where I got my first LOBOS setup).

The root password. Just kidding. What exactly is the error message that you recieve? You should try to ssh in as root from the local machine to eliminate any *other* stuff (perhaps another machine with the same IP is responding? I don't know). Send your sshd_config. What ssh/sshd package are you using? If I recall, RH 6.2 did not come with OpenSSH.

Keith responds:

I see where you are trying to go.  Your problem will be cooling;
anything closed up will interfere with case cooling.  One thing I have
done on my machines in the past is put foam cushioning tape between the
big metal sides of hinge cases, and the metalwork inside - it reduces
the "guitar sound box" effect and muffles the fans.  There seems to be
quite a lot of quiet-fan activity among the case modders, and those
see-through plastic cases they are fond are a little less resonant than
the metal cases, though they would look ugly with foam tape added.

Now, I am imagining modifying one of those Honeywell HEPA air cleaners
to feed a dryer duct, and run that from outside somewhere to the back
of a large wooden cabinet, on rollers, with doors front and back.  Too
wierd and expensive, probably, but it would look nice and be quiet.
Wood = quiet compared to a metal case.   Of course, wood = flammable,
too.

But keep in mind cooling - the insides of computers get too hot anyway,
and those cheap sleeve-bearing fans fail easily.  Plan on fan upgrades
(to quiet/reliable) for all your computer cases before you stick them
in anything closed up.

Perhaps another alternative, if it all goes into a sealed metal case,
is to remove all the computer case covers and operate them open, and
blow air through the entire cabinet.  I read somewhere that the noise
from a fan goes up as the 5th (!!!) power of the air velocity, other
things being equal.  So a 2X radius fan (4x area) moving the same air
volume will need 1/4 of the velocity, resulting in ( 1/1024 (V^5) x 4 (A) )
or 1/256 of the noise - 24 dB less.  So imagine a cabinet with a 4
foot Casablanca-style fan sucking air through a furnace filter and
blowing air through open cases.

More realistically, you have better things to do than invent funny
cases with big fans.  Do the fan mods, find some metal shelving
with an open front, line it with sound-absorbing material (fiberglass
insulation?) and turn it around so you don't have to look at your
computers.  But don't restrict the airflow, or Mr. CPU will get cranky
and write binary obscenities on your hard disk, and Mr. Power Supply
will sing some flame thrower kareoke.

With the exception of its excellent performance, I've been

It's been a few years since I've used Exim, so I downloaded
it on Friday and spent the weekend reading the documentation.
The documentation is very well done and it appears that Exim
has more functionality and flexibility generally and especially
in the area of spam-suppression. I realize that I'll take a
performance hit, but other than that, does anyone have any
reasons why a switch to Exim from Postfix may be a bad idea?

I think water cooling is where you need to be looking.  A single 120mm
fan can cool a system fairly well... and very quietly.  Assuming you
aren't using some super-hot video card, you'll do better with water
cooling than with air cooling, just in the temperature department.

Invariably, people I know who try to close up their computers come to me
to replace their failing hard disk after about a year.  It just doesn't
work unless it is done properly.

Again... water cooling pretty much helps this out.

When dealing with traditional air cooling, you *need* that directed flow
over components.  If you have lmsensors installed, watch your CPU
temperature go up as you open the side of your case.  Your drives won't
get the directed air flow, either.  Neither will your video card. 
Instead all the not-hot stuff gets as much air as the hot stuff does.

If you don't direct the air flow, you're going to need a lot more of it
to keep everything cool.  That'll lead to more noise.

Water cooling is going fairly mainstream in the last few years.  Check
it out... you can cool a whole system, assuming it isn't something
really hot, with a single 120mm fan.  Toss a second 120mm fan in there
to cool the PSU and disks with a little added airflow if you want...
120mm fans are darned quiet compared to what is in your system now.

Ooooo, nice to know there aren't actually any motivations to switch to
Postfix from Qmail as I was contemplating. (i.e., if the license's the
only reason ...) That all sounds pretty much the same, and I've
already got plenty invested in my own setup.

FWIW-Debian defaults to Exim, and so spends time packaging it as
nicely as possible.


(Sorry my email isn't otherwise helpful.)

Making a boot disk should cover all the bases. If you

I had to return the Home Despot stuff because it was totally incompatible.

Does anyone have experience with d-link:

  pcmcia card model dl-g650(802.11g)

Does anyone have a favorite base station card combo(802.11g)?  I'd
prefer something known to  work with Linux.  I'd just as soon have a
base station that is also a simple router and the card might as well be
the g type.

It looks  like the d-link stuff may be too cutting edge for me.  Turns
out the base station supports linux, but the card is some new super
duper fast thingy that has to be firmware updated.

So recommend easy to use base station/router and card please.

Bill,

  I just went through the exercise of seeking a pcmcia WiFi card for use in
my notebook running Slackware-9.1. I ended up purchasing a 3Com 3CRWE154A72.
This is a pcmcia 802.11a/b/g card. There's a newer model, but the
EmperorLinux support folks write that this one is known to be well supported
by linux.

HTH,

Rich

Well, maybe, but I think asking stupid questions is better
than a lot of the OT stuff that's gets on here.  It would be
nice if the Internet had more search engines that more
accurately avoid giving you what you don't want,
no matter what that is.  If you search meta tags for
math stuff and someone says math, but gives you something 
else, what you gonna do?  Why isn't there an equivalent
to Journals searchable through something like google?  
It's hard to keep current information in journal style 
materials, but it's annoying to run into so much stuff 
that's way off that this problem has to be put in 
perspective.  At least there's a real question when
a search can produce anything if you ever want to 
search alone.

If plug list shouldn't be used as a search engine in any
sense, then why does it exist at all other than the
occasional OT post everyone loves, the question that 
google doesn't answer ( uh, I meant OT question again, 
google must have the answer ).  

I don't see how questions on how to use Openoffice's help 
affectively is OT, it was very difficult to find what I 
needed where I cheated by copying the character
I wanted out of the help file once I finally found
a useful page.

I don't think I'm the only one who feels the Internet
is more like a street that cuts through the good and 
bad parts of the world than anything else.  To go to 
a place like that to answer technical questions is 
well, controversial.  For those who say content is 
holy and it's people who make some content a problem,
they've never been addicted to anything or they
don't see anything wrong with addiction.

Maybe searching for Lambda doesn't in most cases produce
links to unsavory sites, but what if you need to find out
about a virus named after a woman.  I guess the best bet
is to simply not search alone, but I wish there was a
better answer.

You can always reformat the hda1 partition to your liking and if it doesn't 
boot you can use a boot disk, chroot to your current linux 
enviornment(/dev/hda2?) and run lilo/grub, that should fix any problems with 
that. Might have to edit the bootloader config though.

Actually in the benchmarks that i've pounded through(all on 32 bit windows). 
The AMD-64 laptops give 2+hours of gaming on battery, and 3-3.5 hours doing 
standard things such as web browsing and simple tasks, and dvd playing 
somewhere in-between. On windows the Athlon-64 underclocks to 800mhz(although 
doesn't affect performance as expected) from 2ghz when on battery saver mode, 
so it saves quite a bit of battery life when you don't need the "extra 
performance".

I'm running dual-opteron 240's in a (currently) 32-bit debian
install, and it is extremely zippy.  (2.4.18 kernel compile in 1:06).

While I haven't played with the laptops, and the AMD-64's have less
I/O than the opterons, I would still reccomend them over a p4 or
p4m.  I wouldn't expect to run a 64-bit environment without a great
deal of work though.  

Looking at the Gentoo-64 technotes/forums may be a good thing to do,
since many of the issues that arise there are not tied to gentoo.
(For example, lilo dosen't work with amd-64 at the moment, and grub
dosen't compile under amd-64--not a big deal, but worth knowing).

Just a side note about AMD-64 performance.. the amd-64 chips are a
great example of frequency (mhz) as a meaningless measurement.  The
1.4ghz opteron is _much_ faster than the 1.4 ghz Athlon MP, even in
32-bit environments.

No, but I've got a nice tarball of exim.config backups from my site

Exim is well-worth the switch.  It's the single thing that makes me
wonder why everybody still uses sendmail...

Yes.  10 minutes of tweaking in any direction from the default Debian
config and you can make exim do darn near anything.  It's the little
MTA that can.

My ibook G4 plays Q3 fine and I get about 4.5 hours in real time usage 
(apple says 6...). It has a 32 mb ATI Mobility Radeon 9200 and 640 mb 
of memory. I guess you wanted a linux solution though.

Another option, I'm not sure if blackbox specific, is to use Alt+RMB
(Right Mouse Button) to resize the window.  Same idea as an Alt+LMB but
you can grab and hold the window anywhere and then resize by moving the
mouse around.  Quite handy.

  None here. It's for external use, particularly when I'm traveling. I
really have no use for one here, other than keeping a cat5 cable from
running across the floor from the office to the den so my fiancee can work
from there on her laptop.

  I'm not even sure what drivers I need for that card. Last night it had
made it to Salt Lake City and should be here tomorrow.

WAP's are not OS specific, if you have a card with drivers that work, it
should communicate with any WAP that uses the same protocol. 
Wellenreiter and my Zaurus loaded with OPIE have hooked up to many
different AP's, it is truly amazing how many open AP's are out there.

The only AP that I have not been able to configure from linux was an
Apple Airport, but that was because it was setup to only communicate
with the Apple-talk protocol.  I have not come across an AP that
requires Active-X or that proprietary browser from Redmond, and the IP
protocol is used as the default by everyone but Apple (and that may have
changed as well).

I must also add that my favorite AP's are just computers running linux,
Gibraltar (http://www.gibraltar.at) being my live-CD distribution of
choice at this time.

Good Luck,

Derek Loree

Subject: [PLUG] Font problem: Slackware-9.1
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0403161818170.26852@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  On my notebook with Slackware-9.1, xpdf would not display many files. It
was looking for fonts in a directory where they weren't located:
/usr/share/fonts/default/Type1. The fonts it sought were in
/usr/share/ghostscript/Type1, so we made a symlink from the former to the
latter. That was good for xpdf: it displayed documents without error
messages. However, ...

  Now I cannot invoke X. When I watched the system boot just now I saw that
the attempt to update the X font indexes (by running
/usr/X11R6/bin/fc-cache) failed; fc-cache seg faulted. Same thing happens
when I try to run fc-cache from a console.

  A google search indicates this happens with some freetype fonts or Hershey
fonts. None of this was a problem with Slackware-8.1 or 9.0 on my other
notebook and it's not a problem with xpdf on my Red Hat systems.

  I'd greatly appreciate some suggestions on how to get fc-cache to run and
update while still being able to use xpdf to view all documents.

TIA,

Rich

All this from a simple symlink?  Is the symlink
/usr/share/ghostscript/Type1 -> /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1 or vice
versa?

Pros - My broadcom wireless works in Linux, which it otherwise wouldn't.
Cons - Most features of it aren't supported, flaky as hell.

Yeh, I was bummed when they went that route, but it is a very powerful
firewall.

I'm still using the pre-1.0 release which is GPL, and the 1+ versions
are free for personal use if you don't want to use the web interface for
configuration.  Since it is based on Debian, I really don't need a web
interface for configuration, ssh works just as well or better.

Brian,

  Believe it or not ... yes! I just did some futzing and here's what I've
discovered.

  The fonts that xpdf requires for many documents are located in
/usr/share/ghostscript/fonts/, but xpdf is looking in
/usr/share/fonts/default/Type1/ for them. So, we made a link from
/usr/share/fonts/default/ that pointed Type1 to
/usr/share/ghostscript/fonts/. X won't load because fc-cache seg faults on
boot. If the system is booted with this configuration, xfce won't complete
loading because the panel crashes.

  If I remove the symlink and run /usr/X11R6/bin/fc-cache, X will come up
just fine, but xpdf won't properly display several files I'm using for
tests.

  Next, I copied all the fonts from /usr/share/ghostscript/fonts/ to
/usr/share/fonts/default/Type1/ after making the last directory. Same
problem as with a symlink: X won't load. Or, at least when booted, xfce
won't load because the panel crashes. Remove all those fonts and X loads
just fine.

  This is something I've not seen in the years I've run linux. I'd be
pulling out my hair over this but there's not enough hair left to pull. If
you -- or anyone -- can help me figure out why I must choose between running
X or being able to display _all_ pdf files, I'd greatly appreciate the
solution.

Thanks,

Rich

It might be nice to see some relevant chunks of your dhcpd.conf file.

Message-ID: <51C21F51CFFAF948A5B9948821B3FE89560764@ex.oci.pcc.edu>

Hi,

I work for a computer training group at Portland Community College.  We
offer general computer courses, certification tracks in Cisco, Oracle,
and Microsoft, as well as courses in OSS. Our URL is
http://www.computers.pcc.edu  

We are revising our offerings and I would like to get feedback from the
open source and Linux community.  We are also looking for people
interested in teaching.

My overall question is what courses would the OSS community like to see.
Some ideas are below but we welcome your thoughts.

Applications - mysql, php, ???

Apache - would people want a short course (a day or less) on
installation and configuration or more advanced topics (if so, which
ones?)

Programming - are there particular stand-alone programming languages
(Python for example) that people want or would programming be more
useful in the context of use in industry, for example J2EE and Web
services.

Small Office/Home Office - is there a need for a course on Linux and OSS
to get a small business up quickly (or encourage a shift from MS).  What
should be included?

Is Linux certification desirable?  Is there anyone with a Linux
certification who has found it worthwhile?

I think you'll want to wrap most of those options in the subnet
declaration and most your host declaration into a group. Plus, I'd
bump up the default lease time on hosts that get static addresses:

# global stuff
ddns-update-style ad-hoc;

# local subnet
subnet 10.0.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  option domain-name-servers 206.26.36.34, 198.107.0.14;
  option broadcast-address 10.0.1.255;
  option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
  option routers 10.0.1.4;
  # declared hosts get longer leases
  pool {
    default-lease-time 21600;
    max-lease-time 43200;
    deny unknown clients;
  }
  # unknown hosts get shorter leases
  pool {
    default-lease-time 360;
    max-lease-time 720;
    range 10.0.1.21 10.0.1.40;
    allow unknown clients;
  }
}

# known hosts
group {
  host apollo {
     hardware ethernet  00:07:95:B0:19:76;
     fixed-address 10.0.1.19;
  }
}

How giant is that network?

The way I handled moving over from a network of static IPs to DHCP is...
assigning the static IPs via DHCP, assigned by MAC address.  :-)

I think, however, you'd find running bind with a local zone would be
worthwhile.  It isn't difficult to set up and gives you a little bit
more flexibility... no messing around with 50 /etc/hosts files.  You
make a change in one place and it is changed everywhere.

There's another way to handle this... the ddns stuff... I haven't gotten
in to that yet, although I hope to shortly.  Perhaps I'll try that stuff
out during spring break.  :-)

You should set up DNS anyway.  It's not hard and it will help you grow.

You can assign static host names to all the DHCP IP's and that can be
done as one line in a DNS file

or you can allow your user's to update a dns server with their
hostnames.

Something must be misconfigured, or you have another DHCP server running
on the network.  My guess is the later, because a fresh DHCP server will
almost always dish out addresses sequentially.

More info would be needed if you are positive that that is the only DHCP
server on the network.

There are also a couple of packages that will update DNS zones from DHCP
leases.  I can't recall what I was using, let me know if you can't find
any information on this topic.

When you keep the hosts file in your head, it doesn't have to too big.

I just discovered from Paul's file how to give all the old guys their

Thank you so much Paul. I'd  looked in books, on the web and the much
out of date HOW-To and I really didn't have a clue.
Although once I'd seen your file, the man page did make some sense.

OK:

I have two Linux boxes. One is a gateway machine w/firewall, the other is a

Now, when I fire up a browser on the job machine and point it to www.ados.com, 
all appears well. BUT, when I use the same browser from the GATEWAY machine 
and point it to www.ados.com, I get "No web site is configured at this

Any hints? I can do this in Mozilla and in Konqueror.

Is the firewall configured to prevent traffic on port 80 _originating_

i.e. 

traffic on port 80 originating from inside network == okay
traffic on port 80 originating from firewall == not okay

Do both machines return the same IP address for that website?

Subject: [PLUG] Sendmail and DNS checks
Message-ID: <20040317222246.GD9869@ahapala.net>

I've been asked to help with a box that is denying mail from the LAN
to the world. I'm not very familiar with bind and not at all familiar
with sendmail.

Old setup:
eth0 -> DSL
eth1 -> LAN 192.168.1.254

New setup:
DSL -> netopia firewall -> LAN
no eth0
eth1 -> LAN 192.168.1.254

So now the internet IP is bound to the netopia and I'm getting an
error like:

Mar 17 12:06:22 server sendmail[19557]: i2HK6LfR019557:
ruleset=check_rcpt, arg1=,
relay=gw.domain.com.zzz.yyy.xxx.www.in-addr.arpa [www.xxx.yyy.zzz] (may
be forged), reject=550 5.7.1 ... Relaying denied. IP name possibly
forged [www.xxx.yyy.zzz]

when a LAN user sends mail. Sending mail from the server itself goes
just fine. I tried adding 192.168.1 to /etc/mail/access, rebuilding
access.db and reloading sendmail but that didn't help.

thanks for any help
Keith

This looks like DNS isn't setup properly for your LAN. How do you
manage name lookups internally (e.g., /etc/hosts, DNS)?

The server is running bind, so the server itself is the DNS
server. LAN clients are resolving Internet sites itself.

Reading on the sendmail site I get:

"Here the (may be forged) is the important part: it means that the DNS
data for the host is inconsistent, and hence the name is not used for
the relaying check but only the IP number. So this is the same
situation as before. If the host name would be used, it would be
simple to circumvent basic anti-relaying checks because the PTR
records might be under the control of an attacker, so he can chose any
name he wants for his IP address. That is, he can select a name for
which you allow relaying because that name is one that you control
(your domain name). However, the forward (A) lookup will fail or give
at least a different IP address, hence the name is marked as (may be
forged)."

>From the server and externally I can dig gw.domain.com,
mail.domain.com, and domain.com and they all point back to the correct
public IP address.

What does dig or host turn up when you feed it the IP address you
masked out in your original message ("www.xxx.yyy.zzz")?

Also, I'm a bit suspicious of the name sendmail gets for the relay:

  relay=gw.domain.com.zzz.yyy.xxx.www.in-addr.arpa

That's just bizarre. I grepped through some sendmail logs for similar
error messages, and never once found sendmail reporting a hostname
ending in in-addr.arpa (the reverse-pointer faux domain).

Keith,

Are you using Bind's split dns feature?  The LAN (i.e. not NATed)
address of mail.domain.com isn't what would show up for external
sites.

Howdy-

I do not have the answer to your query, but I can help a little. 

Most of the guys on this list do not read HTML formatted e-mail. the die
hards that you want to respond to your query have already tossed your 
message, since they are seeing the HTML interspersed in the message.

I'd suggest re-posting in text-only format to get your the results.

Bottom posting will get you more interaction, too.

I know it's a little picky and arcane, it's just the culture of this
group.

when I run host www.xxx.yyy.zzz on the server I get:
zzz.yyy.xxx.www.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer gw.domain.com.zzz.yyy.xxx.www.in-addr.arpa.

and on another machine I get:
zzz.yyy.xxx.www.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer name.dsl.pdx.spiretech.com.
(spiretech is the ISP)

also, if I telnet to port 25 it shows:
Connected to name.dsl.pdx.spiretech.com.

I would think it would report the real domain name.

Mike,

Having just looked up what split dns is, I'd say not. the named.conf
file just has a few zone sections, nothing fancy.

Since that was my first post I will indeed repost with plain text, so I
appreciate the advice, Mike.

Well if we did offer a course in LAMP or Apache or Linux someone with
knowledge and interest in teaching such a course.

PS I hope that this arrives as plain text.

or port 53.  But honestly, that's the sort of behaviour I'd expect and

So when sendmail askes for the IP address associated with mail.domain.com
it receives the external world address.  Yet the connection is coming from
your internal address.

I can only assume that when sendmail does a dns query the bind that is
running on the same server replies. If I do host mail.domain.com on
the server it replies with the public IP address (which is now bound
to the WAN port on the netopia firewall).

The response you get on the server is incorrect, and almost certainly
the source of your problems. Unless you're running a split-personality
BIND and Mike R. suggested, the responses should be identical.
Something is amiss with the DNS setup on the server.

Arrghh! It turns out the client on the LAN was sending it's outbound
mail to the EXTERNAL address. Now it is pointed at 192.168.1.254 and
all is well.

I'll continue to look into the DNS configuration.

  What controls the contents of ~/.fonts.cache-1? I'm wondering if that is
where the xpdf problem I'm having with Slackware-9.1 originates.

  If I have fonts in /usr/share/ghostscript/fonts/ that xpdf uses for some
files, can I add that path to /etc/XF86Config?

Thanks,

  Well, that makes no difference. But I notice that /etc/X11/XF86Config does
not contain /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1, either.

/me is late to conversation, so may not know what's gone before.


Have you tried looking at your xfs config? Most distros set up XFree
to use it rather than doing fonts directly, these days.

Subject: [PLUG] "New Horizons" Scam
Message-ID: <200403180259.i2I2xTFl020220@m5p.com>

People involved with PLUG may be aware of more incidents with "New
Horizons". Pretty much they're a high-tech training company, enticing
people to pay based on the suposed shortage of high-tech jobs. We of
course notice there is only a shortage if you're trying to bring people
into the country, the reality is quite different.

At the moment there is a search for people who have encountered them to
help with the volume of complaints. If know anyone knows people who have
used their services, please pass this along:

-----8<-----------------------------------------------------------8<-----
Back in August of 2003, we succeeded at changing an advertisement found in the Sunday Oregonian for New Horizons Computer Learning Center in Beaverton.  The paper describing the problem is still on our website at:

http://www.ortech.org/newhoriz.html

Unfortunately, this is not the end of the story.  Some New Horizons students have contacted me regarding this article and have shared their personal experiences as students at New Horizons.  Unfortunately, they have not been satisfied with their experiences and are now facing the realities of our current economy and profession.  I will not go into the details of their experiences as this is really their story to tell and not mine.  

To date, a total of 8 ORTech members have been involved in the original as well as an on going investigation of New Horizons.  In general, New Horizons sells the idea of a shortage of IT workers in an attempt to sign up unemployed, underemployed, and desperate Oregonians into a 6-8 month program costing $17,635.  The bait used to lure students is the promise of high paying careers just waiting at the end of their program.  Over the next few weeks, there will be more details regarding the current situation and it is appalling to say the least.  

I have sent complaints to the Oregon Department of Education regarding New Horizon?s business practices.  After a number of conversations with them and with the Oregon Department of Justice, it turns out that the state of Oregon does not investigate so much based upon the quality of evidence presented, but rather on the quantity of people complaining.  

If anyone has been to a presentation at New Horizons in Beaverton or has any other experiences they would be willing to share, the students need your help.  Even a short email note to the Dept. of Education would be of great help at this point.  As always, feel free to pass on this email to anyone you think might also have an experience worth sharing.  Be sure to send a copy of anything you write to info at ortech.org for our records.  

Send your email comments regarding New Horizons to:  

ray.lindley at state.or.us

Subject: [PLUG] Time format conversions....
Message-ID: <1079578805.4983.8.camel@dell.linux.box>

I set up an InfoBot on an IRC channel I'm op in... and wish to use his
logs to provide HTML-ized logs of the channel.  I already have pisc
(something like that, anyway) generating neato-toledo stats.

HTML-izing the logs won't be too difficult, except I'd like to keep the
timestamps... they're currently of the 1079578515 type format, which I
understand is the number of seconds since 01011970 00:00.

I can use perl or bash and any standard utilities on the system... I
have bits of a python script that does this conversion, among many many
other things.  I haven't had much luck ripping it out yet, though... and
would rather avoid python for this (the box in question is a 32MB RAM
UML, I want as little as possible on the box).. but if need be, I can do
python...

Anybody have any thoughts on how to accomplish this conversion?  I think
date -d might be the solution, but how to use that isn't very well
documented (unzipping the code now)...

Well, after looking for a few hours and finally giving up on finding a
solution myself, a friend IM'd me after discovering a lot more
information on the GNU date utility.

rob at dell rob $ date -d '1970-01-01 UTC 1079578994 seconds' +"%Y-%m-%d %T %z"
2004-03-17 19:03:14 -0800

...works like a charm.  :-)

Here's a script I use (sorry, Python:
#####################
#!/usr/bin/python
#
# Quick script to convert a UNIX timestamp to a
# human-readable date string.
#
# $Id: unix2date,v 1.1 2003/01/28 23:00:12 wcooley Exp $
                                                                                
import sys, time
                                                                                
mytime = int(sys.argv[1])
                                                                                
print time.strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S +0000", time.gmtime(mytime))
#####################

I think you can also do it in a Perl on-liner.  Doing a single-format
conversion in C would be pretty easy too.

~/.fonts-cache-1 and the fonts.cache-1 files in /usr/share/fonts are 
produced by the fc-cache utilities for fontconfig.  fontconfig is for 
client-side fonts; I don't think xpdf uses fontconfig so that likely 
isn't the problem.  But having fc-cache crash when running X is not a 
good thing.

On Fedora, xpdf requires the Type1 fonts in urw-fonts.  These are in 
/usr/share/fonts/defaults/Type1.  It sounds like they are in 
/usr/share/ghostscript/fonts for you.

Are you using xfs?  Or fonts directly from XFree86?  With xfs, add the 
path to /etc/X11/fs/config.  Otherwise add it to XF86Config; I forgot 
the syntax.  Also, you need to run mkfontdir to rebuild the fonts.dir 
files.  On Fedora, /etc/init.d/xfs script does this automatically.  It 
should be "mkfontdir /usr/share/ghostscript/fonts".

I've also been looking, though probably won't buy until sometime this 
summer.  The current models from E-Machines (M6805, M6807) are 
apparently oem models from a company called Arima (sp?).  There is a 
website around somewhere talking about running Linux on these systems. 
I don't have the exact url at the moment, but it's relatively easy to 
find using google.  The summary seems to be it's another "mostly" 
working situation, with problems getting acpi support exactly right, and 
one device needs a driver that's only available in binary.

Another Athlon-64 laptop is the one from Hypersonic 
(www.hypersonic-pc.com).  This one looks like it's intended more as a 
desktop replacement notebook.  There are more speed options; more 
configuration options, etc.  You can order it without paying the Windows 
tax (e.g. they can ship it to you with only a formatted hard disk 
installed).  You can also have the case painted in many different 
colors.  It's a bit more expensive than the E-machines system; probably 
between 2000-2500 depending on configuration.

I've heard that Alienware also has an Athlon-64 notebook; I haven't 
checked that yet.

Just an FYI to let everyone know that there is an electronics distributor
called Nu Horizons.  They are also located in Beaverton.  They sell
electronic components, and compete with companies like Arrow and Avnet.

No, I'm not affiliated with them.  I would just hate to see them get
confused with this 'training' company.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0403172319250.28908-100000@uplinknetworks.dyndns.org>

I have users that have lots of subfolders in Mozilla mail.  When they move
messages to a folder, the messages don't show up.  Some folders will
appear empty.  They can go into the IMP webmail and see all the messages
in each folder, however.  But for some reason these messages aren't
showing up in some of the folders (some folders work fine and have their
messages).
We're using Courier IMAP and Postfix on the server.  Mozilla 1.6 on Win2K.

Has anyone encountered this before?
Thanks,

If this is the same place, I have an acquaintance who teaches there yet

He is, however A+ Certified, whatever that means.

Yes I have.  Since I access my mail from several different systems and 
several different accounts IMAP is the only reasonable way to go.  I tried 
the web mail interface and sometimes still use it but it is two slow and I 
have to login to each mail account instead of getting them all at once.

This happens from WinXP - Mozilla 1.6, RHL 8.0 - Mozilla 1.4, and Fedora 
Core 1 - Mozilla 1.6 systems.

I was thinking it was because of the IMAP server I am accessing (all
accounts come from the same 'mail server' software) but feel a little
better now as someone else is experiencing it.

As times permits I'm searching for 'the' solution.  Nothing so far though.

Yeah,
	I actually found that Maitac makes the hypersonic and the older voodoopc 
athlon-64 notebooks for them. There are a ton of companies around that are 
willing to sell the same exact notebook(different labled name) for $300-500 
less. With Hypersonic and Voodoo, you're paying more for the fancy paint job 
and the "brand name". And here's a few interesting sites i turned up:

AMD Board -- http://www.amdboard.com/athlon_64_notebook.html
	nice list of currently available athlon-64 notebooks

AMD 64 Notebooks - http://www.amd64notebooks.com/
	They have forums, and are fairly new. An actual place for people to talk 							   
about the Athlon 64 notebooks.

I'm actually looking to buy one at www.cyberpowersystem.com, they seem to have 
the best deal around so far for a 3400+, 1 gig ddr-333, extra battery, 2x 
dvd, 60 gig 5400 rpm, and no OS for about $2300. That same system at 
Hypersonic is about $2700 and $3500 at voodoopc.

I guess you did not read the whole message then, it is not a chain
letter, or a petition.

Why would you not want to stop a scam that victimizes people?
Why do you care that others try?

The difference is this is a computer industry-focused mailing list
and the original message was about training in this industry.

My apologies. I intended no offense. 

I would have worded it differently if I had composed the mail for the
list, but his reply-to address was broken, and, without thinking, I just
sent it back to the list.

Most non-?nix users do not have the slightest idea about the rules, I
still get all-caps e-mail from customers. 

Again, no offense intended.

Message-ID: <031820041714.21556.1546@comcast.net>

I'm not sure I'd call this a "scam." However, I would place it on the "PLUG-TALK" list. 

It's my humble opinion that a lot of training places (not just New Horizons) have under-qualified instructors.  I'm recently employed (in a shop in Vancouver) after being unemployed for four months and that free pizza was sounding awful tempting. I was actually more interested in the LapTop training courses- I liked the idea of getting an "extra" laptop. 

My only previous association with NH was giving them money a few years ago to take my MCSE tests (yes yes whatever. drool over there please). But I've worked with another place like NH (affiliated with a state instution of higher learning) and I have to admit- some of the teachers were great, some were not-so-great. 

Something I've learned over the years; the most important thing about taking a class is how you approach it yourself. If you have a good teacher but you don't apply yourself in a learning frame of mind, you're not going to get it. If you have a mediocre teacher, she/he will keep you more or less on track as you learn. If you have an underqualified teacher- at least you've got the time spent going to the classes and learning in a group. The group would be the second most important thing about learning. Followed by the teacher.

I wouldn't classify "New Horizons" as a scam- or their selling methods that way either, unless you also go after IT Tech, Laptop Training and any other "school" that's going to charge you (a lot of money) to train you for a position that may or may not exist- and if you believe their salespeople (who just want butts in chairs) without doing your own research on job availability... you're at fault too.

Subject: [PLUG] Redhat Psyche updates
Message-ID: <20040318174325.GC13326@ahapala.net>

I am helping a friend manage a Red Hat 8.0 (Psyche) box. I migrated my
own RH servers to Debian last year so I'm out of the loop as far as
the RedHat/Fedora status goes.

I'm going to need to need to maintain the updates for this box and
need some pointers to get back in the groove. The client isn't
registered with RedHat Network.

Is RedHat still providing updates for 8.0? Is Fedora providing updates
for 8.0 or are Fedora updates only for Core 1 and newer?

I guess the main question is: What is the updates URL for my
situation?

TIA,
Keith

1. download yum:

   http://linux.duke.edu/projects/yum/download/1.0/yum-1.0.3-1_80.noarch.rpm

   You'll also need to install the librpm404 and rpm404-python
   packages if they aren't already on the system(s) in question.

2. concoct a decent yum.conf, e.g.,

[main]
cachedir=/var/cache/yum
debuglevel=2
logfile=/var/log/yum.log
pkgpolicy=newest

[base]
name=Red Hat Linux $releasever base
baseurl=http://download.fedoralegacy.org/redhat/$releasever/os/$basearch

[updates]
name=Red Hat Linux $releasever updates
baseurl=http://download.fedoralegacy.org/redhat/$releasever/updates/$basearch

[legacy-utils]
name=Fedora Legacy utilities for Red Hat Linux $releasever
baseurl=http://download.fedoralegacy.org/redhat/$releasever/legacy-utils/$basearch

3. as root, grab the current header set and look for updates (may take
   a couple minutes):

   yum check-update

4. do needed updates:

   yum update

5. put a cron job in place that does periodic reporting; at work, I
   put this script in /etc/cron.weekly:

#!/bin/bash
#
# yum.cron -- weekly report on what packages need to be updated
#
# $Id: yum.cron,v 1.2 2004/02/02 22:48:48 heinlein Exp $
#
YUM="/usr/bin/yum"
echo "####################################################"

echo "# Yum update report: $(/bin/hostname)"

echo
if test -x "$YUM"; then
  $YUM check-update
else
  echo "$YUM is apparently unavailable."

Ditto with Pine.

As a word of introduction, Byron has been teaching UNIX-related classes
at PCC for quite a few years. I've taken them & felt I got my money's
worth. He's definitely of a different level of quality than the
``training center" mentioned in another thread on the list.

In other words, has more skill & experience than many of us regulars
on the list -- just perhaps not in certain areas.

So if he's done something minor -- such as accidentally using HTML format
in writing to the list -- treat it as if it were something on the level
of a typo & move along.

I'm reminded of a radio commerical I heard a little over a year ago
while visiting the in-laws in Ohio. It was hyping a local training center --
which offered the usual run of Microsoft & A+ [1] certifications,
as well as Web programming classes -- & happened to mention that obtaining
any of these would result in immediately landing a job paying $60,000 to
$70,000 a year.

I was a might incredulous about this claim, since it was more money than
I've ever seen offered for any comparable position -- even with several
years of experience.

How long is the Fedora group going to update the legacy RH8.0 version? Have they said?

I maintain a half-dozen boxes that still run Red Hat 8.0: a couple
servers and some workstations used by Ph.D. students who want an
absolutely stable environment while they finish their disserations. I
migrated all those hosts to Fedora Legacy stuff a few months ago.
Repeating the info is simply a cut-and-paste operation. :-)

You'll probably want to read the Fedora Legacy FAQ for yourself:

  http://www.fedoralegacy.org/about/faq.php

If something is unclear after that, I'd be happy to take a stab at it,
or you can ask on one of the Fedora Legacy mailing lists:

I am setting up a Hylafax server. I have a couple of questions...

1) How do I deal with 10 digit dialing and seperate local 503 numbers from 
non-local 503 numbers?

2) Is there a way to get caller ID or ANI information from incoming calls?

3) Any suggestions on Mac OS X clients for Hylafax?

Back in the days of FidoNet you simply had to keep a list of all the
local exchanges and make rewrite rules based on those. I imagine
there's a way to ask the telco's around here. Anybody know?

Alternatively, you could find a way to make your users choose, somehow.

I do hope, Keith, you haven't actually flooded any mailboxes with crap,
as you seem to be implying you've done.  WVI is not a very large
company, it's usually pretty easy to talk to TPTB, 'cause usually TPTB
is singular in such companies.  I've dealt with them before, too, they
seem rational.  :-)

It's about as much good, really, as a RHCE.  Something to look nice on a
resume for potential employers who are lacking in Clue.

Hi,

It looks like the Linux network administration class will finally have
enough students to be held Spring term at PCC (Sylvania campus in room
SS103).  It is part of a sequence designed to prepare students for an
entry-level position as a system administrator of a network utilizing the
Linux network operating system. Networking, TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, NFS, Apache,
Postfix, Samba and a bit of network security are covered.  Text is TCP/IP
Network Administration, 3rd ed. by Craig Hunt:
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/tcp3/.  We cover most of what's in the book
plus some.

Prerequisite: CIS 240L or knowledge of computer concepts, *nix file and
directory system, common command line utilities, basic shell scripts,
installation,  configuration and basic administration of a stand alone
Linux box.

Class meets Tuesday evening from 6 to 8:50 starting March 30 for ten weeks.
 Send me questions, register online (www.pcc.edu, CIS279L) or just come to
the first class and we'll work you in.

Thanks,
Mike

Does this class provide actual college credits or is it CE credits?  :-)

Windows is just another hammer. Granted, it's made from balsa wood 
and glass, and I wouldn't sell it to my friends, but for some people 
it's an adequate solution. I'm not in the position you folks are in- 
I can't turn down a job because it uses the Empire's software. I can, 
and do, encourage others to look into Linux, but if the client uses 
Windows, I try to help them use it.

At any rate, I got my MCSE in the past too. And when my Evolution 
stopped "having messages in the inbox*" this week, I restarted my 
computer, laughed about the MCSE solution, and got on with my life.

*Yeah, I looked for other solutions. I looked for deleted messages. 
I opened up my mbox and ensured there was stuff there. I killed all 
evolution processes and restarted them. I didn't try just restarting 
X and KDE. Restarting the computer "solved" it.

I use RedHat at work, Debian at home, Slackware in the past.

Does anyone have an easy solution for allowing remote users to relay mail
through a mail server after they've been authenticated by the IMAP server?

The few solutions I've discovered so far require rebuilding the software,

Matt,

Using postfix and courier-imap that can be done a couple of different ways.
Currently I have my users using authenticated smtp for sending their email.  If
you want to see the important parts of my config, see this page:
http://borosenclave.com/index.php?p=33.  You can certainly also setup
pop-before-smtp following this howto:
http://www.stahl.bau.tu-bs.de/~hildeb/postfix/postfix_pop-before-smtp_en.shtml.

If you need more assistance than that, I would be glad to send you my full
configs off list.

I have a client who travels a lot. Unfortunately, there's no way to know
in advance what network he's coming from so I check the sender's
address. This way, if the sender originates from my_networks or they
have a sender address of client at client.com then we relay the mail.

Yes, I know that a spammer could "hijack" this address and use the
server to spam through it. I watch the server closely and it really
hasn't been a problem. If someone tried that, I'd know about it almost
immediately.

In /etc/postfix/main.cf:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
    permit_mynetworks
    check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/sender_access
    reject_unauth_destination

In /etc/postfix/sender_access:

userone at yourdomain.com	OK
usertwo at yourdomain.com	OK
....
lastuser at yourdomain.com	OK

Note: be sure to "postmap /etc/postfix/sender_access" to has the file.

I hope this helps!

There's DRAC, but I don't know if it works with Courier and in any case
it's something of a hack.  Almost all MTAs now support SMTP AUTH, which
isn't too hard to set up with Postfix, once you work out file permission
problems (which can be nil if using saslauthd).

Yeah, how about it - "Get your free Domino's pizza, and sign up for a 
6-8 month training seminar for $16K!!!"

I'm simply not getting how fools are falling for this bunk - I mean, 
that's more expensive than one of the national top 5 engineering 
universities, out of state, for a semester/two quarters.

I guess when there's money to be taken, the taking's good...

Probably nothing.  I just have to research what it is and how it's
configured first.

You seem very bitter.

Perhaps some meditation?

Put yourself in the others' shoes and see if you can understand instead of
just getting angry and indignant.

I'm pretty sure the OP said he was using Postfix and didn't want to mess
around with his current configuration any more than was necessary.  :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Perl strategies for parsing multi-line configs
Message-ID: <20040318223453.GB5353@rauhaus.org>

I often have to compile information from things like Cisco configs, and
I'm hoping for some suggestions to deal with this in a more elegant
fashion than my normal mess of "if (/^interface/) { ...blah...; }".

Here is part of a typical config:

interface FastEthernet0/16
!
interface FastEthernet0/17
 description cubicle x
!
interface FastEthernet0/18
 description Company CEO laptop
 duplex full
 speed 100
 switchport access vlan 152
!
interface FastEthernet0/19
 description Crappy Server
 switchport access vlan 51
!
interface FastEthernet0/20
!

So each interface is the basic unit I'm working with, but there are a
variable number of items that follow each interface.

If I want to make a list of, for instance, interface, vlan, and
description, is there a cleaner way to do it rather than testing for
'/^interface/' and setting $description to empty and $vlan to 1 (the
default) each time I hit a new interface line?

What I would really like to get are generalized strategies for reading
multi-line, variable-length text records.

Thanks,
--Stafford

I'm told good things about Parse::RecDescent. You should know
something about lexers, though.

I was marking off the section that was copied directly from what I
received. Your illustrative example was much more helpful in figuring out
how you were misreading the message. I suppose I'll have to send a
warning back to the origin about the possible misread.

The key difference here is that I *know* the originator, so I know this
is a genuine issue. Be assured that I will never pass along the sort of
garbage you're talking about.

>  How about I start posting George Bush sucks letters and ask people

The key difference has already been pointed out, this is tech related,
and it is specific to the Portland-Metro area. Both of which made it
reasonable to send here.

Folks involved with the origin of the message (http://www.ortech.org/)
managed to convince New Horions to tone down some of their claims.

So, does your postfix not have SASL support?

I believe all you need to do is put this crud in your
/etc/postfix/main.cf:

smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes
broken_sasl_clients = yes
smtpd_sasl_security_options = noanonymous

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
<whatever your real stuff is, plus>
                                permit_sasl_authenticated

smtpd_sender_restrictions    = check_sender_access <some lookup method,
mysql, pgsql, hash, whatever>

Then you need to create something like /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf:
pwcheck_method: PAM <or whatever method you like>

And then create a PAM thingie for smtpd in /etc/pam.d/smtpd:
auth	requisite	pam_modulename.so options
account	required	pam_modulename.so options

I think that's all I had to do...

Actually, you want to use 'saslauthd' here, and run 'saslauthd' with PAM
authentication.  Before Cyrus-SASL 1.5.27, you had to dance carefully
around permissions to do PAM authentication because Postfix, Cyrus IMAP,
OpenLDAP, etc drop priviledges and can't automatically read /etc/shadow.

> And then create a PAM thingie for smtpd in /etc/pam.d/smtpd:

The PAM auth name is smtpd, even if you use saslauthd.  (Actually, I
think it's just 'smtp'.)

This is from another Keith (the one with a hard-to-spell last name),
requesting:

1)  Please move the discussion of New Horizons to plug-talk.

2)  Please do not send anyone any threats, obscenities, or especially
    computer viruses.  This stuff is actionable, and can involve jail
    time.  I have better things to do than appear in court to testify
    against impulsive hotheads.

3)  If your name is Keith, put your last name on your .sig so the SWAT
    team attacks the right house.


I've had bad days, too.  Sometimes my only comfort is knowing that if
I act *really stupid*, they could be a whole lot worse.  Lashing out
on email ranges from unwise to really stupid.  It's a sunny afternoon,
take a walk and cheer up!

Ian,

  It crashes only if 1) there's a symlink from the directory in which xpdf
is looking for the fonts and the directory where those fonts are actually
located or 2) I copy the fonts from the latter directory to the former
directory.

  On Slackware-9.1 there was no ../fonts/defaults/Type1 in /usr/share. We
added the /fonts/default directory then used Type1 as a symlink to
/usr/share/ghostscript/fonts.

  There is no xfs running as a process. However, there is /usr/X11R6/bin/xfs
which can be started from within rc.local using the '-daemon' option. I just
added /usr/share/ghostscript/fonts/ to /etc/X11/fs/config, ran 'mkfontdir',
killed X and restarted it. No change.

  What next? This is a real puzzler to me and the folks on aols haven't been
any help.

Thanks,

Cliff and I lost classes that were under 17. Aparently we weren't as good

  We have a clinic this Saturday (20 March), don't we?

  I'll bring my notebook for assistance with the xpdf fonts problem and the
new wireless card so I can get that up and running, too. Turns out the
notebook has neither linux-wlan-ng nor HostAP as installed drivers. I'd like
to get these two up and running, as well as being able to use my Kyocera
SmartPhone QCP-6035 as a cellular modem with the machine.

  Hope the requisite expertise can be there!

TIA,

Rich

I hope so too! :) As usual we will try our best - which is a fancy way of
saying "I'm not sure if we have anyone with those exact skills." Are you

Rob,

  The HostAP driver works with cardbus cards, too? All I see on their Web
site refers to WAPs attached to a workstation.

Dan,

  Don't have one. But, I can bring a wire coat hanger and hold it between my
teeth. :-)

  Ectually, if I can get the proper drivers installed and recognizing the
card I'll be satisfied. I realize there's no WAP in the lab. I'll read the
wireless-HOWTO prior to the clinic so I should know a bit more than I now
do.

HostAP can either work as an Access Point or regular drives... as
regular drivers, yes, they work with cardbus, PCMCIA, miniPCI, PCI, and
I think even USB wireless NICs.

  Ah! I suspected that to be the case but the Web site wasn't very clear --

The HostAP website, IMHO, pretty much sucks.  It was unclear to me, as
well.  I asked on this list a few months ago if HostAP could be used as
a regular driver or if it was just for acting like an access point
*because* their website didn't seem to outright say it.  :-)

Err... yeah, that's what I'm doing.  'Cept it ain't saslauthd, it's

Err... right:

-rw-r--r--    1 root     root          366 Nov 10 01:23 /etc/pam.d/smtp

Most of that was off of the top of my head.  Certainly not intended as a

  I just discovered a difference between Red Hat and Slackware that may be
useful to others here. Or, I may be the last person in the world to discover
this. Regardless, ...

  To convert from DOSs cr/lf to UNIX/linux's lf, Red Hat has the utility
called 'dos2unix' (and it's twin, 'unix2dos'). These are not found on my
Slackware system. But, thanks to the good folks at google (who are looking
to hire, by the way), I found the reason. The equivalent tools in Slackware
are called 'fromdos' and 'todos'.

  I wonder what else I'll find to step in on the conversion path.

The previous reply is right, look into Parse::RecDescent.  But
for this particular case, there is a very good, very simple
core Perl solution:

Each record is delimited by \n!\n.
Each element appears to be line delimited (\n)

So this should work:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

$/ = "\n!\n"; ##Input line delimiter set to record delimiter

while (<>) {
  my @fields = split "\n";
}

Now it's up to you to parse each element.

I need a haircut. Jeme didn't mention the fact that,
even with a primitive Web cam, you can point it at the
back and sides of your head to assess this without
using multiple mirrors. 

I installed Mandrake 9.1. They try to make it
impossible to get RPM's without joining their club,
although I would consider doing it. So I compiled
Camstream. To tell the truth, I would like an
application with a few more features, but this is just

I have two IP addresses that are assigned to the same WAN interface on a
Linux router/firewall.  Users are NAT'd behind this box.

I want normal traffic to use one IP address, but if the user is going
through the Squid proxy running on the router/firewall, I'd like the
traffic to use the other IP address.

So, for example, if the user browses to a website then they would appear
to come from 1.2.3.4.  But if the user has configured their web-browser to
connect to the Squid proxy then they would appear to come from 1.2.3.5.

Is this possible?  If so, how would I configure the router/firewall?
Thanks,
~M

Do both machines return the same IP address for that website?

First of all thank all of you for putting in some time with these suggestions.
The problem at the gateway machine went away. I am a field engineer (PE in 
mech eng,) but not a network admin - I know how to 'ping' but that's about 
all the tools I can apply to the problem.

The only difference is that when I ping my ISP (ados.com) from the gateway 
machine, I get : "Destination host unreachable."

What commands can I type to find out what to do?

Also, I live out near St. Helens/Scappoose. Does anyone know of a Linux 
'techie' who can take a look and fix this?

Currently the problem is intermittent, and I have gotten away with powering 
off both systems and then restarting both, giving the gateway a 'headstart' 
by a minute or so of the "[ OK ]" listings.

It looks like the "tcp_outgoing_address" option in squid.conf should
be what you're looking for.

The following message pops up from time to time,
though I don't seem to have reduced functionality:
"Could not find MIME type inode/chardevice."

I had just removed a .RPM (though not with the
"nodeps" option), so perhaps it took out something
that some application other than the removed one was
actually using. The screen is a little annoying,
though, so if someone could explain this, I would
appreciate it.

The application I suggested was actually a frivolous
one, so this was intended as humor. At the same time,
with a Web cam not now much more expensive than a
second mirror, and certainly more convenient to use
for this purpose, it might have the edge.

Well I see they have 12, so I'm in.
I'm looking forward to your excellent skills as a teacher again.
I've really missed not being able to continue directly from one class
to the next. I admit now to being rusty. I assume you'll help bring me
up to speed for the class?

Well, I've got the book and have started chapter one. Anything else to
recommend?

  There are some of us who would burn out the sensor with reflected light if

Hi,

It's about $250 plus the text, $30 from bookpool.  Plus you may want to
setup a lab at home, a linux box and another box with TCP/IP, two NICs and
a crossover cable.  You can use the lab at PCC but there is a special kind
of knowledge you get at 2 in the morning when you beat up a problem with
the assistance of loud music and peperoni pizza.

Cheers,
Mike

Hi,

The official word is the class is going to happen so do a couple of
installs (Red Hat 7.3 is fine but I may use Suse 9 in class) review your
CIS240L text and practice binary/decimal/hex conversion (just kidding,
we'll cover the math in class).

Cheers,
Mike

Mike,

  Generally, that special knowledge is that your neighbors don't appreciate
your tastes in music -- particularly loud music -- at 2:00 a.m. And after a
certain age, you learn that your waistline reflects too many pepperoni
pizzas.

Mike has good cheatsheets for the math stuff, too. 

If I was more employed, I'd sign up for the class.  :)

Hi,

Holy cow!  I'm 54, how much longer can I get away with this?  It's the only

I don't think I have the knowledge/skills to benefit from this class.  I 
have yet to successfully set up a Linux box, despite hours of effort and 
reading.

Is there a class/place where I could learn the basic's and get a box set 
up and running so I could start learning Linux?

Thanks,

Does the ping return an IP address, before the "Destination host
unreachable"?  Most firewalls these days will drop ping packets, because
they can be used for denial of service attacks.  A program called
tcptraceroute is much more useful, and most firewalls will allow traffic
from it.

Good Luck,

Bring your box to the clinic tomorrow afternoon at Riverdale!

J.

PS.  Is anybody going from NE?  I would maybe like to help out this week
and I'll actually be awake for it.  I would like to ride along.

Cruise around mail and news with an agent capable of seeing X-Face
headers and you'll eventually find someone who was burning out the
sensor with reflected light while they were taking the picture for
X-Face.

Yowsers, I've been using slack for about five years and never noticed
the `todos' and `fromdos' commands!  I did however have `dos2unix' on my
box because I needed it and grabbed the source and compiled it.  Now
that I know about the two that come with slackware I can just toss
`dos2unix'.  Thanks Rich!

well for some time now my solution to see any type of media is to
download it to my harddrive and play it with Mplayer. I have come across
sites that don't let you download the files such as this one.

http://www.apple.co.jp/quicktime/trailers/casshern_large.html

I would like to see the trailer but how can I do this with out
restarting my computer and loading winXP?

I have tried to solve this problem several times in the past and have
failed miserably. Any pointers would be helpful?

I use the epiphany browser.

Mike,

  Today's clinic is a very good place to start. Personal assistance, lots of
eager helpers, many others in the same situation.

  1:00-4:00 p.m. @ Riverdale HS on SW Twilliger.

  Bring your system (box, monitor, keyboard, mouse) and your distribution of
choice.

Subject: [PLUG] Cups Printing Problem
Message-ID: <1079794253.6203.12.camel@apollo.spears.org>

I have cups installed and running on three computers, all running
Fedora1. An hp1200 is installed on computer P and it works. Up until
recently it also worked across a network on computers L and O.  The only
thing I changed was the net work IP addresses and I now use dhcp. Yes,
they can ping each other.

P is set up to broadcast its printer and L and O show it in their admin
(http://localhost:631).
1 When L or O try to print a test page, a job is created locally but not
on P.
2. On L, lp works about like admin, it appears to create a  job, by
returning a request id, and nothing happens on P.
3. On O, lp says that no default destination available.

What I often do in this case is view the source of the page and find 
where the movie is.  Then use wget.

Check the log files on L and O.

Check permissions on P.  I think if I remember right be default, Cups
won't talk to anything except itself.  You will have to edit the config
files by hand, the webpage doesn't have this functionality in it.

Then restart cups.

Most of the stuff in cupsd.conf has to do with restrictions on from
where you can administer the server.  As I said this alway just worked
before I did dhcp.

Forget this one.  In red, at dlink support, any static addresses outside
the pool range will not be assigned. Well, WTF, did they accept them
then?  Why didn't they say something? All these commercial  bas-ds worry
about us 'stealing' their IP.  What about them stealing our time through

OK, my networks a mess now. I might as well run DNS locally and see if

Have you tried the mplayer mozilla plugin? (available from whereever
you got your mplayer). It plays quicktime files great here from
within the galeon browser, and is reported to work with all browsers
in the moz family, including epiphany.

Message-ID: <405D3764.5020908@comcast.net>

I posted a plea on Friday, March 19, 2004 for info on where I could find 
some help getting my very first Linux installation to function.

Rich Shepard, Jeme Brelin, Mike Neal and Galen Seitz responded with 
blinding speed, telling me to turn up at the monthly clinic at Riverdale 
on 3/20/2004 at 1:00 p.m. and to bring my box, distro and problems.

Much to the amazement of Jeme, Russell and several other wonderful and 
incredibly generous guys, I did so.  I suspect that someone lost a bet 
on whether the guy with the stupid question would actually turn up the 
next day.   Lost bets notwithstanding, I received an incredible amount 
of help for which I am extremely grateful.

If you are a lurker or other newbie, don't be afraid to bring your 
computer down and join the fun.  These folks are nice, knowledgable and 
very helpful.  Next time I'll know to bring diet Coke or donuts, or 
something to fuel the crew.

Seriously, I'm reasonably competent in my own field and frequently 
volunteer my time to help new or otherwise inexperienced folks out.  I'm 
frequently rewarded immediately by learning something new and often 
rewarded later by a nice reference or referral.  All that said, I really 
appreciate the effort by Russell, Jeme, John, and all the other folks 
who were so welcoming and helpful.

I promise that if I ever learn anything, I'll be ready to give back as well.

Thanks again,

Mike Layne

Message-ID: <1079854918.4581.9.camel@rhws.theplatinumrule.com>

I'm looking for a way to keep copies of mail I send through my own mail
server. It's running RH8 postfix and sendmail.

I've tried tweaking postfix, but it does not appear to have anything to
do with outgoing mail. Google tells me to build a special version of
sendmail and then compile it, something I'm not interested in.

Am I missing something basic here?

A quick google tells me it is easily created with the command:

mknod /dev/sg0 c 21 0

Google really does know everything.  :-)

Surely your system comes with a MAKEDEV script of some sort.  Often you'll
find this in /dev.

Postfix AND sendmail?!?  That's... unusual.

In fact, I think there would be some definite stomping of toes with that
combination unless you're doing something really interesting and know
exactly what you're doing.

But anyway, are you just hoping to keep copies of the mail you send out
yourself or copies of other people's mail going out through your server?
If it's just your mail, I would think that you'd just want to set the FCC
in whatever MUA you're using (or use tee if you're sending it directly to
port 25 or using mailx or something otherwise strange).  If it's other
people's mail that's passing through your mail server, well, I don't think
I'd like to participate in getting that to work.

It was a pleasure helping, Mike.  You're on a great track and I think that
after the first few weeks of learning, you'll be very happy with what your
system can do for you.

Feel free to email us if we didn't get you totally on your feet.  I know
we ran out of time right there at the end.

> I suspect that someone lost a bet on whether the guy with the stupid

As a matter of fact, Russell and I were discussing your email to the list
on the way to the clinic.  It seems there's ALWAYS one person who cries
out for "some place I can go to get this working" in the last day or two
before each clinic... and, inevitably, the person never shows up.  Glad
you did.  Hope to see more of you around the list and meetings.

> I promise that if I ever learn anything, I'll be ready to give back as

I think you'll be surprised at how soon that time comes.  The curve is
steep, but the view from the top is great (well, that's what they tell
me, anyway).

Welcome to the club.

It's a function of your MUA, not MTA.  Try enabling using an FCC: when
you send.  Pine and mutt support this.

Mike,

  I suspect you are: your MUA. Whatever you use to write your outgoing
e-mail then passes it to the smtp tool (postfix). It's up to the MUA to save
that message.

  Pine and sylpheed certainly do, and those are the only two in use here.
I'm certain that they all do this.

Why is that? Is it due to personal/ethical or legal reasons?

Bill,

  I cannot directly answer your question because I changed hats when they
switched from a Red Hat to a plain Fedora. However, from 2.0.8 (or whatever
it was in RH 4.0/4.1) through what's currently running on my RH 7.3 box,
I've downloaded source tarballs from kernel.org, built them and installed
them without problems.

  FWIW, go for the 2.4.24 kernel instead. It's a bug fix for the .23
version.

HTH,

Rich

Postfix 1.x and later has 'always_bcc', which will send a copy of every
message to a particular address.  Later versions of 2.x (possibly only
in the snapshot) have more fine-grained controls.

You mean 2.4.25 which is a bug-fix for .24 version which is a bug-fix
for the .23 version? ;-)

  Well, what I saw from Red Hat's bugzilla report for Top Hat-9 referenced
2.4.24. The latest Slackware kernel is 2.4.24. So, I suppose one could spray
raid0-raid5 on it to kill the rest of the bugs.

Having experienced the fun of hauling a tower system to the Linux clinic 
at Riverdale H.S., I want to non destructively re-partition the hard 
drive on my old Toshiba Satellite 2545XCDT and make it a dual boot 
system with Debian on the new partition.

I've read about fips and downloaded all the info from the Redhat distro 
so I'm about ready to pull the trigger however I have this nagging 
question that I haven't been able to answer thus far.

Will fips work with Win XP Pro with the NTFS file system?

Thanks,

No, I doubt it.  FAT filesystems are considerably simpler than NTFS
filesystems, so it seems unlikely.  OTOH, there might be a tool in the
ntfs-utils for Linux, but I don't know.  However, I seem to recall that
2k/XP also have a disk administration tool than can resize filesystems.

Quote:

  Marcelo Tosatti followed up his release announcement with another
  email highlighting security fixes in 2.4.25 and 2.6.3 [story]. He
  explains, "2.4.25 contains several security related fixes, including a
  fix for another sys_mremap vulnerability. Upgrade to 2.4.25 for those
  who use mainline kernels is recommended. [...] For those using 2.6,
  upgrade to 2.6.3 is recommended." Linus Torvalds added, "please
  upgrade if you allow local shell access to untrusted users."

So, make sure your distribution has at least back-ported fixes.

PartitionMagic can do NTFS. (And Ext2, even.)

fips is seldom useful when the partition you're trying to
shrink is a Windows partition of any type, including FAT.
Windows sets many of its disk blocks as "unmovable" and
fips cannot move these unmovable blocks. The disk defragger
program supplied with Windows also cannot move these blocks.

This means that the most space you can recover is from the
end of the partition to the unmovable block closest to the
end of the partition. In most cases this will not be enough
space to install Linux.

Partition Magic is the typical solution.

  But, for the non-typical user, defenestrating completely is the better

Yes, I was. The settings I was I was trying to tweak is procmail. I use
sendmail.

It seems like it should be easy to keep a log or something of the mails,
I do not need to have them e-mailed to anyone, I just want a record of
what I send through my server. It doesn't seem like it should be a big
deal to do, but what do I know. It seems like companies would like to
know what gets sent through their servers, too, doesn't it?

  I can confirm that fips will NOT work on NTFS. When I installed SuSE
9.0 Personal on this system, it took considerable effort to get it where
I wanted. I have a 60GB hd, so it seemed reasonable to slice off 20 or
so for Linux. The tool that came with my distribution worked to some
degree, but was quite conservative, and I was left with a much smaller
Linux partition than I wanted. I finally backed up my personal stuff,
then blew away everything. I reformatted to give a third each to
windoze, Suse, and future use. I'll probably eventually put Fedora in
the remaining space. After completing the Linix installation, I restored
WinXP, providing an NTFS partition (C:), and a FAT partition (D:). So,
here is what I see from here:

mel at d8qbcf21:~> df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda7              19G  5.4G   14G  29% /
/dev/hda5              16M  4.3M   11M  30% /boot
/dev/hda2              16G  5.8G  9.3G  39% /windows/C
/dev/hda3             2.1G  1.4G  698M  66% /windows/D
tmpfs                 125M     0  125M   0% /dev/shm
mel at d8qbcf21:~>


It's worked out nice so far.

Indeed, but the latter unmovable blocks are usually paging space, so you
can set the maximum paging space to 0 to move them.  At least, I recall
having done that at some point in the past.

I read an article written by some ACLU folks that seemed to imply
storing email that is simply passing through your server was not exactly
legal.  I'm no lawyer, so I really don't know what merit that had.

Either way, I would make sure before doing something like keeping track
of every email that passes through your server that doing so is, indeed,
legal.

The paging space wasn't the problem. Even if you eliminate the
paging space, you'll still have tons of unmovable blocks on
disk.

Well, I'm now the proud owner of Partition Magic 8.0, now a Symantec 
Product by the way, and am busily wrecking the hard drive on my laptop.

Meanwhile, on the desktop model, the install is plugging along.  I go 
down sporadically and add a -f command to whatever's going on and that 
seems to make it happy for a while.

More anon.

Good luck with that.

Remember the install tricks we talked about yesterday.

The 2.4 kernel boot iso is here:
<URL: http://debian.linux.org.tw/pub/boot-floppies/cvs/bootbf2.4.iso >

It's a small iso and you can put it on the tiniest CD you've got (business
cards or whatever).

When the installation process asks if you'd like to add any additional apt
sources, go ahead and say yes, then change all of the "stable" lines to
"unstable" and save the file without exiting the editor, then hop to
another virtual console (alt+F2), login with the root account, and run an
`apt-get dist-upgrade`.  I THINK that will work.  If it says the apt
system is locked, just go ahead and go back to the first console (alt+F1)
and continue the process as directed.

Yeah... sometimes you've got to tell it to "fix" when you've interrupted
the process (as we did about five times yesterday!).

Have you tried the new Debian Installer? Beta 3 came out last week and
is quite nice:

http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/

Installs sarge, grub is now the default bootloader (I like this, others
may not), can install via wireless PCMCIA devices (even w/ a WEP key),
etc.

Since it's just you using the server, I'm sure you're fine.  :-)

Uh... but not sid?  Personally, I've had very bad luck with testing and
much prefer unstable for boxes that can afford a little downtime and
stable for servers and things on which others rely.

Haven't used grub yet... I'm wary, but not for expressable reasons.

Damn those liberals and their blasted human rights!

Anyway, the proper answer is still just setting the FCC in your client.
That way you don't rely on particular server settings and can change your
smtp relay if necessary and still get your desired behavior.

Or just BCC yourself as so many people do.

  Wow! Your own personal copy of Michael Powell, right there in your

  I suppose, however, that's only available with Debian unstable. Oh, well.

Grub rocks.  Everything is determinable at boot time rather at the
last time you had the system running (and thus could re-run lilo).
You can start any kernel you have on your filesystem dynamically.  You
also don't get the "LI..."  messages.

LILO essentially "pre-cooks" your booting options.  When you run lilo
after modifying /etc/lilo.conf, you are writing a list of data block
addresses of your kernels, etc, to the second stage of the boot
loader.

Grub's second stage knows about various file systems and can read the
configuration files, kernels, initrd's etc at boot time.  If you screw
up booting from the harddisk somehow, you can build a simple Grub boot
floppy by dd'ing a couple of generic files onto the floppy and then
use any of the kernels already safely on the harddisk.  Much more
flexible.

For a nice explanation of how boot loaders work, see:

  <http://www.xs4all.nl/~lennartb/bootloaders/>

Grub does have some peculiarities, such as zero-based disk and
partition numbering, e.g. the first partition of the first disk is
called (hd0,0) in grub parlance.  This takes a little extra toll on
them arithmetic processing unit up there in the grey cells, but on
balance it seems worth the price.

I don't have _any_ LILO boxes anymore.  Grub is worth learning.

Not that I have an opinion or anything. ;-)

Subject: [PLUG] Laptop search...
Message-ID: <1079977149.21551.40.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I'm looking for a 100% Linux compatible laptop to run 
maple 9 on under X and either Redhat 9 or newer.  Turns 
out I need at least a 700 megahertz Pentium III, but I 
am wary of buying old considering old is a greater 
issue with laptops than desktops.  New is also cheap 
now, Dell starts at $700.

Digging some, I have found
http://www.linuxcertified.com/liunx_laptops.html.
The web listed  prices are a bit high and I don't know 
if they are reputable, what their shipping times are, 
what the brand names are that they sell, etc.

I also ran into ALS looking at a Linux laptop Howto, 
this place is worse on prices than linuxcertified though.

Linux is free, yet a Linux compatible laptop appears to cost
significantly more than a Windows laptop.  What gives here?

Any incompatibility on a machine I expect to take to college
to study Linux, Vector Calc, and database with could cost me 
time, but the cost of getting a perfect Linux laptop may be 
too high also.  The only other thought is to figure out from
what doesn't work on different models what the Linux community 
will most likely fix by the time I need it working and get 
that laptop. 

I can probably get a Dell fairly reasonably, but if they have
abandoned their Linux line, what do I want to get in today's
offerings?

Doesn't HP have Linux preloaded laptops?
It'd be nice if I could run maple on Debian since that's
a more popular system to learn administration, etc, on.
I've never installed debian, hence a pre install would
be extra nice.

I've always had good luck running Linux on Dell, Toshiba, and IBM
laptops. There are gotchas on some models -- winmodems can be a
problem, and bleeding-edge video and/or wireless chipsets may not be
supported -- but mostly they work just fine. I'm typing this message
on an IBM T22 that's rock-solid with Fedora Core 1.

  I should have noted that the real problem with resizing the windoze
partition, wasn't because of the Linux tools. It has to do with
defragging in preparation. In theory, this is supposed to push all files
to the "front" of the disk, making all free space contiguous at the
"end" of the disk. You then carve your Linux partition from the free
space. I found that with WinXP, there were always some "unmovable" files
near the end of the disk.

Another vote for IBM T series notebooks.  I bought my T21 several months ago 
for less than $500 and the convenience of running it in the living room 
wireless (i.e. on the couch next to my wife) out weighs the performance 
boost from desktops in the computer room.

Subject: [PLUG] Perl - Passing my script's arguments to another program
Message-ID: <1079984393.3841.10.camel@timmy>

I want my script to take any number of files as arguments, then pass
them off to a separate program for processing, and capture the output in
either a file or a variable. This would be easy, but the filenames may
have any number of weird or strange characters in them, including
spaces.

I have tried this:

open (TMP, '>', "/tmp/file");
select (TMP);
system ("command", @ARGV);

That sucessfully runs "command", but does not put the output in
/tmp/file.

There is no switch for the command to output to a file.

How can I do this?

system() spawns a subshell.
you could have your script do the following

$outfile = 'Foo.out'
$command = "uname -a > $filename"
system($command);

as a side note, try to stay away from system() if you can.

This may turn out to be one of those utterly pointless and frustrating
responses we see on this list sometimes, but I have to ask.

Is this part of a larger perl program or standalone?  I ask because it
doesn't really make sense to do what you're trying to do in perl.  It
seems very much a shell-script kind of task.

Not the case. Thanks for asking.

This is a very small perl program. I know very little about how to do
anything in a shell script, so please show the way.

I do know that, in bash, $* is the arguments passed to the script. So I
tried this (the exernal program is metacam, my script is script.pl):

#!/bin/bash

metacam -ax $* > /tmp/metacam-tmp.xml

script.pl /tmp/metacam-tmp.xml

Then script.pl will read the file $ARGV[0] for further processing.

But even this breaks when the filenames passed to the bash script
contain spaces.

So now my question is broader: How do I pass args to a command of this
form:

command $ARGS > filename

in any language?

Escape the spaces... or better yet, don't use filenames with spaces in
them.  :-)

Either use quotes or \'s:

rob at dell rob $ touch "a file with spaces in its name"
rob at dell rob $ ls *spaces*
a file with spaces in its name
rob at dell rob $ cat a\ file\ with\ spaces\ in\ its\ name
rob at dell rob $ cat "a file with spaces in its name"

Either way, the thing should all be passed as ARGV[1] to
perl/c/c++/whatever, or $1 in bash.  Since spaces are what seperates out
the ARGV's, if you don't escape them it assumes you meant to have
separate arguments.

Why?

I read somewhere that you shouldn't use backquotes unless you wanted the
output to be put into a variable, so that's why I'm using system().

@   Expands to the positional parameters, starting from  one.
    When the  expansion  occurs  within  double  quotes, each parameter
    expands to a separate word.  That is, "$@" is equivalent to "$1"
    "$2" ...   When there are no positional parameters, "$@" and $@
    expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed).

Subject: [PLUG] Mbox Size Monitoriing Script
Message-ID: <1079992361.8980.41.camel@localhost>

Hi All,

Every once in awhile, something really great comes along that just
perfectly fits the bill.

That was the case this morning with the 'mboxfull' script authored by
Dave Regan at Armored Penguin.

A little background: I sent an email recently asking if anyone had a
script that would monitor a user's Inbox and warn them if it were
getting too full. I had actually included a script that may be modified
to suit my needs and offered a $25.00 bounty for the first one to
produce a "production quality" product.

The next day, Dave sent an email that quoted as follows:

"There are a number of ugly things about the program you found such that
it will be easier to start fresh rather than modify it..."

Shocking for some, an inspiration for others; note what Doug McIlroy,
the inventor of Unix pipes and one of the founders of the Unix
tradition's words:

  "Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh
rather than complicate old programs by adding new features."

Dave was right. 

Dave's mbox monitoring program was nothing short of spectacular. The
script was well thought out, cleanly documented, and indented
perfectly.  You'll see what I mean when you click through to his script
here:

  http://www.armoredpenguin.com/mboxfull/

In the first sentence of Dave's script site he writes, "mboxfull is a
trivial little program, without any runtime, to send email to users
whose email box is nearly full." If only he could see how happy his
script has made my client!

Oh, and the booty? Dave had this to say:

  "If you send me a check, I'll only spend it.  Instead, send it to
Pamela Jones at Groklaw."

A man of great character. Thank you, Dave.


Best,

Yeah, this isn't a particulary perly task.  It'd probably faster to just
run it in a shell.

Here's a quickie bash way of doing it:

for file in "$@"; do
    command "$file" >output_from_"$file";
done

Dig that?  You quote the variable instances so that the literal characters
in the variables are used instead of splitting on the spaces or what have
you.

Season to taste.

Apparently a good choice except for ACPI problems.  I don't know if the
5100 on Dell today is the same as the 5100 I am finding a lot of
positive comments about.  The only thing other than the ACPI
problem is evidently the touchpad which the manufacturer will
supposedly provide source code for and the network card,
a broadcom something.  I wanted to find out if the 1100 is
Linux friendly but by the time you put a P4 on it it almost
costs the same.  Dell evidently forces an office suite and
more on you, anyone cashed this stuff in for a refund?

Do you get installation CD's or is Dell's software only installed
to the computer's hard drive?

For $1000 or less new, this is looking like the way to go.

One thing to keep in mind with a low end machine like this. It is very 
heavy in my opinion. My wife has an 1100 and I certainly wouldn't want 
to lug that around all day, compared to my ibook, it is just plain 
unwieldy. The graphics that come with it are also fairly anemic. I 
would upgrade to the separate graphics card if you can afford it. The 
onboard Intel card shares memory with the system, so plan for that. I 
personally think you are going to have a hard time keeping that system 
at under 1000 if you add anything that a student would most likely want 
like a cd burner and wi-fi card. The card dell sells isn't that great. 
I think you can get a better deal at best buy.
	As far as a software rebate, you do get disks, but they are not 
official application disks. I would be highly surprised if you are able 
to get any sort of discount or rebate on those.
	I know you are into linux, but you should really consider an ibook as 
well. These are highly usable and well under the 1000 mark with 
educational pricing. You can run PPC linux quite well if you want, but 
i think if you tried OS X you would be really surprised. It is a very 
friendly environment for a Unix hacker and with fink, you can get 
almost all of your favorite Open Source apps. Also, I have compiled 
several things from source and since you get gcc, its fairly 
straightforward. Just a though and an alternate view from someone who 
is doing what you hope to do in the future.

Dell stuff comes with installation media, but the preinstalled software
is configured in such a way that you just can't boot the thing (or even
get into the bios setup) without first agreeing to the Windows license
agreement, which makes you the sole user of the software whence you are
contractually bound to not resell the stuff and you can't trade it in as
unused.

Neat, huh?

There's a difference between freeware and Free Software.

If you meant to include Free Software in that comment, all you're really
saying is that your idea of "practical" is separate from your value of

Admittedly, it was over three years ago now, but when I a Compaq
Presario laptop with W2K preinstalled, it was on a FAT32 filesystem.
I was able to FIPS and install linux without great difficulty.
Remember, the worst you can do is destroy Windows.  Where's the big

Well, I talked to Dell and I have to say that at least they are
diplomatic unlike that gal at IBM.  They don't carry a Linux laptop
product line anymore, which is frankly disturbing.  A couple of places
have gone broke, so it doesn't look like anyone knows how to do it.

I would like to see some new laws after this ordeal.

    1) No diagonostic tool sold with an OEM computer shall depend 
       on a proprietary operating system to function unless these 
       tools only make sense for troubleshooting that system.  
       A customer that rejects the license for the installed OS 
       shall be offered a refund for it and any other charged 
       for software that depends on the presence of that system
       to function.  The refund offer must cover the full amount
       charged for this software or the best estimate possible
       must be offered.

    2) No computer manufacturer may be charged a tax on each 
       computer manufactured for a software product(s) 
       regardless of whether or not a customer wants 
       that product or a vendor installs the product.

    Violators of these above two proprosed laws should owe
a free laptop for each violation :-)

IBM has been advertising Linux, why on earth did I get an
angry and nasty woman when I called and asked for a Linux
Thinkpad?  Dell at least said, "let's try to find you a Linux
specialist."  A+ for effort Dell.  I signed up for a temporary
account and they did suggest the 300M and 500M models when
I told them 7 lbs is a bit much to carry.  Unfortunately,
I don't know that a Pentium M covers a Pentium III or better
requirement where it's $1500 for their 3 lb laptop, the 300M.  
The Dell Inspiron 5100 should take Linux okay.  If I had a 
digital version of each of the books I carry, the 7.22 lbs 
problem wouldn't be such an issue.  The battery indicator 
evidently won't work under Linux, so I should probably buy 
a second battery and run it the way they did with the old 
Volkswagons before fuel gauges were introduced.  I'm not 
settled on it yet, but it's nice to know that someone at 
Dell appreciates the guy that wants to run Linux ;-)

OEM's have right and I hope some day that these rights
can be protected so that consumers can ask for what 
they want without fear of Microsoft or any other
Goliath retaliating.

Yesterday, I went through the usual hell of working with CUPS.   I
eventually got it to work, although I'm not convinced I did it the right
way.  Today, while skimming Slashdot, I came across these links to
commentaries by Eric Raymond about his similar experience with CUPS in
which he says that we will have to make software much more discoverable
and transparent if we want it to be widely used.

No, I think having too many laws in place over these kinds of things
isn't a good idea.  There's no need to get so nitpicky about it. 
Besides, I understand people have had luck getting a Windows Refund.

Taxes are traditionally government run things, aren't they?  The
government isn't charging the Microsoft tax.  The Microsoft tax is a
misnomer.

Is it faster than 700MHz?  You should do fine with a Pentium M.

As much as I hate to send you over to another list I regularly read...
you'll find much more information about running Linux under any Dell
laptop on the linux-dell-laptops Yahoo! group.  I will leave it to you
to locate the group and ask questions there.  From what I've read, the
5100 is pretty well supported under Linux.

Good luck finding digital versions of all the books you carry.  ;-)

Use a recent kernel, like with the relaxed whatever ACPI (AML, is it?)
setting and you'll likely find you have much more luck with battery
information.

There's been a Dell dude posting off and on to the linux-dell-laptops
list.  He put together a little bit of information, too...
linux.dell.com, I think it is?  Maybe it's support.dell.com/linux or
something.  Google knows.

The market just isn't there yet for Linux laptops.  It won't be there
anytime soon, either.  That is why those who do sell Linux preinstalled
laptops have such high prices.

I have a San Jose client that will be jumping into Linux with both
feet (Yay!).  They want to buy about a dozen preconfigured Linux boxes.
Unfortunately, to be compatable with the expensive CAD software they
will be buying, they will probably be running Redhat 7.2 on most of
them (Boo!).  Given the driver-sensitivity of some of the older distros,
they will need some pretty lemonade boxes with no need for fancy drivers.
They will also want screaming speed.  What's a hacker to do?

They would rather buy pre-configured boxes from IBM, HP, Dell, or Sun,
even if they are 2X-3X cost.  They don't want to spend a lot of time
fiddling with BrandX boxes, and they want hardware support.

Hell, for 2X the cost I'm sure any of us... I definitely would... would
be willing to put together a dozen Dells running RH 7.2.

Or better yet, real vanilla boxen.  It would be fun.  :-)

  It's too bad that it takes someone of ESR's stature to get a positive
response from folks like those at Easy Software. I went through the same
nonsense a few years ago. But, I discovered that configuring CUPS through
the command line interface didn't work; I _had_ to use the BUI to do the
job.

  This is, unfortunately, another validation of why developers should never
write documentation. They cannot see the software from the naive users'
perspective. In the late 80s I wrote a database program and asked a friend
at work to give it a usability test for me. He crashed it almost
immediately! I was watching at the time and asked him why he did what he
did. He shrugged and said it seemed like a fun thing to try. Well, with
Fred's help I blocked all the possible wrong things a user could do that
didn't even occur to me. It was a very good lesson, though.

Yeah, worst case, you'll have to restore from backup.
Laptops get dropped, fried and stolen.  You *do* have a backup, right?

Heh.

Also, I found that GNU PartEd would do a nice job of moving the data on
a FAT32 partition out of the way.  

This was particularly useful when I was setting up a new IBM laptop that
had WinXP preinstalled.  There was a FAT32 partition that'd boot,
configure Windows and then convert itself to NTFS.  So I caught it when
it rebooted to do the NTFS conversion and used PartEd to shrink it down
and make room for a Linux install.

NTFS ain't a bad filesystem.  It's a shame M$ seems to use it mainly to
shut out other OSes rather than, say, enhance the security of PCs.

I have something like this for a Windows app that you could modify for
Hylafax. It's got most of the exchanges for Portland. 

I also have a Hylafax server at work with MS clients. They use Winprint
HylaFAX to send faxes. It works nicely. The user just inputs the

interested...

HP (Compaq) Proliants are very nice server boxes. A DL380 is a good 
choice for a rack mounted  server if you only need 2 processors. The 
also have DL385s coming out this month if you are interested in a 64 
bit chip. These use the AMD Opterons and look like they will be a very 
nice solution. They also have excellent remote administration via 
"Lights-Out" cards. Expect to pay 3-7K a box for a decent 
configuration. See
http://h18004.www1.hp.com/products/servers/platforms/index-dl.html for 
more info.
I am not sure if you can get them to do RH 7.2 anymore, but you can 
ask. I have run that particular configuration in the past with no 
issues.

Contact me off list if you want me to put you in touch with someone 
from HP.

Actually, you can get ffmpeg packages in binary form if you put this in
your sources.list:

deb http://marillat.free.fr/ unstable main

You might want to also include the Rarewares resources for some of the
other video/audio utilities:

deb http://pessoal.onda.com.br/rjamorim/debian/ ./

I'll second the DL380 suggestion. We've got a half-dozen or so in
production at work, three of which run Linux: an educational login
server, a file server with a 1.7TB filesystem exported via NFS and
SMB, and a general-purpose server providing SquirrelMail, Mailman,
LDAP, and NTP. They're all configured with redundant power and dual
processors. I've had one power supply go bad; otherwise they've been
flawless.

I've also got a DL360 (a 1U case, no redundant power, ...) that's done
very well.

Which CAD package?  I _try_ to follow what is happening in the Linux-CAD
world but don't always succeed but a software package that relies on a 
distribution that old (verses Redhat's 7.3 enterprise stuff) surprises me.

Thanks! In the meantime I had cobbled together a perl regex to escape the
funny characters, but I knew that was a kludge. Now it's much better: a
wrapper bash script first calls metacam and then my script.

Seems like you could put together white boxes, and for less than 2x-3x,
send them extras.  If a machine goes down, they will have extras already
on site, loaded and ready to go.  

The best thing that you can do for speed is fast hard drives, either
SCSI spinning at 15,000 RPM, or SATA spinning at 10,000 RPM (like the
Western Digital Raptor).  Dual Channel DDR is nice, but in my
experience, the hard drive is the biggest bottle neck.  I just built a
machine using the ASUS P4P800-DELUXE that could run the SATA drives in
"legacy" mode, making them appear to the OS as regular IDE drives.  I
was pressed for time, so I wasn't able to try loading linux on it, but
I've never seen 2k run so fast.

I also have had to do less repair on the white boxes that I build
compared to the branded boxes that my clients bought.

Just some food for thought,

on the whole "developers debugging their own program" topic. it is not 
possible for a developer to debug their own program well. for that matter, it 
is not possible for a developer to do a very good job debugging a program 
they know well. this has nothing to do with the intellegence of the 
developer. it has to do with the fact that the developer knows what the 
program is supposed to do, and how to make it do the things that it is 
supposed to do. since they are predisposed to this information, doing the 
things that the system aren't able to handle never come into perspective 
because knowing how the system works, there would be no reason to do that, 
since it should do nothing. 

i guess the point is, i just wanted to back up Rich in saying that you always 
want a third party to test and try and break your application. and finding a 
regular user as opposed to a fellow developer is a plus as they will be more 
likely to do the random things that are likely to cause problems.

I have to look this up every 6 weeks it seems so I thought I would post

kernel (say for wireless, ntfs, alsa, etc).

The pattern follow.  It create the kernel tree, dependcies, paths, and
include files.  You can include "MODULES=ntfs" to make just one module.

  A friend is a graphic artist making his living as a CAD operator. Several
years ago I helped him boost the responsiveness of his system. Yes, hard
drive data transfer speed is a major throughput bottleneck, but so is the
speed of the video card. They're probably much faster now than they were
then, but there is very heavy number crunching going on for the display.

Good point, the biggest problem in this regard, these days, is the
built-in video that shares system RAM and use the main processor for
most of the GPU operations (the Intel on-board video is an example of
this).  These make anything displaying more than a text console very
slow.  

Most 4x AGP cards should be quite fast at rendering 2D, and fast 3D is
not very expensive any more.

  Red Hat 7.3 comes with gcc-2.96. An application I want to build and

OK, so after Russell's ringing endorsement, I installed grub on a box at
work.  Havoc ensued.

So, whatever I did, the system was unbootable for a while.  I eventually
figured out how to make it bootable and even wrote a barely functional
/boot/grub/menu.lst to boot the thing.

Seems OK, but not perfect.  Here's the sitch and the concerns:
/dev/hda1 is /boot, ext2.
/dev/hda2 is /, reiser.

Debian creates symlinks for the current version of the kernel and initrd
image in / (/vmlinuz and /initrd.img, respectively).

I want a grub menu item that will default to the current kernel image and
associated initrd, but the symlinks span filesystems.

What's a boy to do?

If I simply create symlinks in /boot, will I have to do this with each
kernel upgrade or will Debian do the right thing automatically?

Does everyone that uses grub with Debian just manually update the menu.lst
every time they update their kernel?

Well, if you use the "update-grub" script it will create a menu.1st file 
for you (well, it will regenerate a portion of it, but leave your 
changes) with all the kernels you have installed, and the latest at the 
top (and therefore the default), this is the most useful most of the time.

I don't know about "everyone", but as for me, basically, yes.  

  make oldconfig ; make ; su -c 'make install ; make modules_install ; vi /boot/grub/menu.lst'

Also, I don't have a separate /boot partition, which makes grub work a
little nicer.  The separate /boot partition requires (when I saw this
~6 months ago at a PLUG clinic) a small kludge.  See the GRUB docs or
FAQ for your choice of kludge.

My menu.lst files look like:

   default	saved
   timeout	5

   title	Linux 2.4.25
   root	(hd0,0)
   kernel	/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.25 root=/dev/sda1
   savedefault

   title	Linux 2.4.22
   root	(hd0,0)
   kernel	/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.22 root=/dev/sda1
   savedefault

   title	Linux 2.4.20
   root	(hd0,0)
   kernel	/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.20 root=/dev/sda1
   savedefault

The "savedefault" does the obvious thing, it makes the corresponding
index the default on the next boot, presumably by stashing the value
on disk somewhere.

You could probably hack /sbin/installkernel to modify menu.lst if you
wanted to avoid the manual editting.

Thanks, Dan.

And if I build a custom kernel, I just run /sbin/update-grub.

Good stuff.  Pretty straightforward.  A bootloader with a shell, though...
phew... isn't that what they used to call an "operating system"?

I've done it, on RedHat I think.  What happens is that the gcc binary is
installed as gcc-[version] and 'gcc' is a symlink to the version you're
using.  Change the symlink to change the version of GCC.

I think some makefiles can be told which version to use, too.

Good luck,

No, just something better than your normal brain-dead boot loader.  After 
dealing with Sparc architecture for couple of years and the accompanying 
OpenBoot boot manager anything Intel architecture seems positively brain 
dead.  Grub is a nice step in the right direction, IMO.


I'm really curious to see if any of the linux based bios motherboards will 
make their into the commidity realm that we experiece with other pc 
hardware.


But speaking to the original topic.  One particular thing that I know LILO 
does but have not seen with GRUB is the ability to test boot on a new 
kernel and if that fails the subsequent reboot go back to the previous 
kernel.

Yeah, I used that a whole bunch.  There was some good and some bad.

Don't some Macs use OpenBoot?  They used to.

I just remember that awful Open Firmware song on the Sun site.

As in lilo -R?

I kind of got the idea that Russell's setup did that... sorta.  You
selected something and it only became the default if it boots
successfully.  Is that right?

I'm thinking about doing something to really drive my wife nuts and 
install Ethernet Jacks in  the  living room right behind my chair and in 
the attic where  I'm planning to install a couple of wireless access points.

In the process I plan to move my home office from the main floor bedroom 
where it gets in the way of everyone but me, to the basement which is 
cold and lonely but can be heated by running several computers at a time 
in what I hope will be a combination home office/computer lab.

This will involve moving my Comcast data cable from its existing 
location on the main floor to a different location in the basement; 
Running an uplink to a patch panel, probably in the attic, then running 
cable to the wireless access points and to the Ethernet port behind my 
chair in the Living Room.  I may have to install some additional power 
outlets for the access points etc. in the attic by extending a circuit 
from an existing electrical junction box in the attic.  I'll probably 
just put a switch in the computer lab so I can play with 3-4 machines at 
once.

I'd like to be involved in the process and am looking for someone who 
really knows his/her stuff and would be willing to work with me on the 
project without sending me to the bank for a second, or actually third, 
mortgage.

As always your recommendations for who would be a good choice would be 
appreciated.

Thanks,

It seems wrong that your kernel is not in /boot. I mean what else is /boot for?
One solution would be to  put the kernel and initrd in /boot, put the symlinks 
there also and grub  will have no trouble with the symlinks. 
The other possibility is to skip using /boot and point grub to / instead.

The kernel is in /boot, there are just automatically installed symlinks 
that reside in /. This is old and pretty standard behavior, useful for 
lilo, but not so useful for Grub, at least if you have a seperate boot 
partition.

Mike;
I did basically this, last fall- and I can tell ya that Home Depot has the stuff you need. They have ethernet cable, snap-together jacks that come with the worlds worst working punchdown tool (and semi-coherent instructions), and a patch panel (I overspent and bought the one that will do cable tv and phone, but they allegedly have just the patch panel). 
Once I figured out that the patch panel was not equal to a hub, I was golden.

On a wall in my basement is mounted the comcast cable modem, the hub, the patch panel and cables out to my work area in the basement and the living room.

My wife still ruminates about the holes in the walls, but they're mostly scabbed over now, and we're not going to talk about me drilling UP from the basement through the hard wood floor to get the ethernet cable up to the living room.

IMHO the hardest part was the wall-stuff. We have plaster and lathe and it's hard to patch a big hole so that it looks semi-normal. I was content to run the ethernet cable around the top of the ceiling in the basement.

Subject: [PLUG] Is Debian that hard to work with, or am I that dumb?
Message-ID: <4060B605.CAA77F9F@tercent.net>

Hi folks,

I have had a real interest in Debian for a year and a half now, ever
since I did a net install on an ancient machine that has long since
died.

However, the last two times I went to install Debian, I gave up in
frustration and broke out the RedHat ISOs after a couple days of misery.

These last two times were with a Compaq ProLiant server and a Dell
Dimension -- both extremely ubiquitous units, one old and venerable and
one new and up-to-date.  However, both times, I had to play all kinds of
games with kernel recompilation just to get the NIC working, and I never
did get XFree86 up.

What I want more than anything for production machines in future is a
boring version of Linux that is rock-solidly stable and slow to mutate,
supports Apache 1.3 and Perl 5.6, is widely used by the clueful and has
good documentation on how to secure it, has an automated update system
for security updates, and installs reliably and straightforwardly on
very standard hardware.

It seems like Debian has all of those things except the last.  Am I
missing some low-hanging fruit (like, "nobody uses the standard ISOs
since they have no drivers on them, just buy a CD set from XYZ Corp with
all the drivers in there")?  Or is the solution just to buy a bunch of
RHEL licenses every time I want to put up some web servers?

Best,

Randall

I'll tell ya... I installed Debian on a Dell yesterday.  I had no such
trouble.  I had to choose the network interface driver (eepro100) at the
stage where the install asks to select additional kernel modules, but it
(of course) just worked after that.  Very normal part of the set-up.  I
also installed the DRI module for i810 (the motherboard chipset) and then,
when the XServer package was being configured, I told it to use the i810
driver and gave the horizontal and vertical sync of the monitor (from the
web) and X came up perfectly on the first try (I had to adjust the monitor
itself to center the image, but that's not unusual).

There may be something that seems obvious to me that has, heretofore, been
hidden from you by "user friendly" software configuration, but I can't
imagine what it is.

Netinst images are the way to go, of course.

Sounds like you should have been at the Clinic last Saturday.

I do _not_ really know my stuff, cable pulling anyway, but having
faced a similar problem, I'll share how we solved it.  

Basically, rather than start drilling random holes in lath & plaster
walls and screwing around with fish tape, we went wifi.  We do have a
cable run from the basement to the second floor.  That run is
accomplished with a conduit running up the outside of the house (which
is not inconsistent with what seems common practise in my
neighborhood).

I have had similar difficulties with Debian in the past.  Specifically 
with a Compaq DL-380.  The current (at that time) Debian installation
didn't recognize the HW Raid disk partitions or the NIC card.  I asked
my team to give me some time to fix the problem and they agreed.

After much teeth nashing I found a website (which I can't find right now)
that explained how to install your own custom kernel on the debian 
installation disk.  I built a custom kernel, which I do on all my 
computers (production or not) which supported the Compaq array and the
NIC card and proceeded with the installation.  I think I had to go to 
another terminal at one point to run one command manually.

Ok, so that doesn't sound like it was worth it.  However, that same server
has been up for over 3 years now.  The kernel has been patched twice, and 
all the software has been kept up to date with apt-get.  The server has 
reboot twice in three years for kernel upgrades, less than 5 minutes each
time.  That is my book puts that server at over 5x9's of availability.

Red Hat has had three new OS versions so far.  Reinstalling the latest OS 
or running a very old OS isn't an option that I would want to support.  
All the time I see people running RH6.0 (for example) and wondering how 
to get the newest ssh installed on it.

I guess my point is spend the time up front getting it to work right the 
first time and you will spend less time supporting it in the end.

One final note: Try the Debian BF2.4 installation disks they have a pretty
good selection of equipment support

  For the record, at last weekend's clinic we discovered the source of my
inability to display certain pdf files using xpdf on my notebook. The
incorrect font paths were in ~/.xpdfrc. Because I had never needed to do
anything with either a global or local rc file for xpdf I didn't even know
that one existed.

  Editing the font paths in that file made all the difference. Another day,
another linux lesson.

I should have mentioned that in my post.  I always use the 2.4
boot-floppies netinst cd image for stable.

You probably should replace that kernel after installing, though... either
with a debian kernel package or with your own.  (For one, there is no
generic scsi or ide-scsi on the bf2.4 kernel image, so you can't write to
an IDE CD burner with that kernel. -- Don't mistake that for no SCSI
support, though.)

Now that my MythTV box has been kickin' ass for more than a month, I need to boost the hard drive capacity so I can keep my son's Scooby Doo episodes and still record Survivor and MadTV. I need to replace the existing hard disk with a bigger one, rather than just add a disk. The reason I don't want to just add another disk is because the cabinet that this box is in gets a little warm, and adding another disk to the system will not help in that respect. The box will take a second disk so I can have both new and old disk in the box at once. I guess my plan is as follows:

1. Install the new 120G disk as a IDE slave
2. Boot up. Partition and format the new disk.
3. Sync the files from the old disk to the new disk, one partition at a time.
4. Install the bootloader on the new disk. (How do I do this part??)

Does this sound like the path of least resistance? If so, how do I do step 4?

Thanks,

It should work, but I would do it all in single user mode so you don't end
up with all your pidfiles and things copied across.  That could be a real
mess.

It depends on what you're running and how you want to go about it.

One very easy way would be to just copy everything to the new disk,
install remove the old one and install the new one in the master position,
boot with a boot disk of some sort giving root=/dev/root/on/new/disk on
the command line, then run the boot loader's command to install it in the
MBR.

There are other options; many that do not require a boot disk.

In fact, I think with grub you wouldn't have to do anything but install it
in the MBR of the second disk right away.

Furthermore, the upcoming sarge release has been reduced to a minimum
of 10 keystrokes for the entire install, most of which are "Enter".

I'm close to getting my wireless card working with a static IP address,
but it is getting errors when pinging the AP, and hence is useless.
The card: D-Link DWL-G650 rev B2, F/W 2.23
The AP: D-Link DI-624
Tell me what else you need to know.

In addition to the "default" directive in menu.lst, use the "fallback"
directive.

This (and for LILO too, I believe) only helps if the physical disk
blocks fail or the kernel entry point fails. It's still difficult for
an x86 platform to figure out if an OS load fails late into the boot
process.

I am running Fedora Core 1 and using grub. Is it pretty straightforward?

Relevant ifconfig and iwconfig outputs, what drivers you're using with
the card, dmesg output relating to the drivers, the actual errors you're
getting... stuff like that would be really helpful.

Note on lsmod. This is lsmod after reseating the card, which is typical
for this machine.

You can do step 4 (before step 2) by copying over the mbr using dd
dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdb bs=512 count=1
This copies over the partition table also, so you will have to do it before step 2
and then repartition the drive.

Oh man I wouldn't do that.  I've tried using dd to copy one filesystem
to another and while it works, it's dreadfully slow.  I'd use something
like cp -a or rsync on each of the filesystems.  Plus, with the above
method, you end up creating partitions with the same sizes as before. 
And I'm not sure how it handles differing geometeries...

Naw... the way 'lilo -R' works is that it boots a particular image on NEXT
reboot only, so if it fails, it'll reboot and come back as the old
default.  Then, when the system comes up, you can change the default to
the new kernel if you like.

It would be nice to be able to tell grub to boot to a particular image on
next reboot only.

Oh yeah, I'm an idiot.  Still, it seems more difficult and esoteric to

You can also just chroot into the new disk environment and install
your boot loader that way...

For what it's worth, I've had the same difficulties with RedHat 9.0 and ES
2.1 on Compaq DL380 servers.  RedHat 7.3 and 8.0 worked fine.

That wacky RAID controller causes all kinds of problems.

I haven't installed Red Hat 9 on a DL380 G2, but it's running fine on
an older DL 380.

This sounds like a good way to do it.  In step 3 be sure to use a program
that preserves permissions and isn't stupid about things like block
devices.  Most Linux utilities do this well.  The only tricky part really
will be limiting your copies to one partition at a time or else you'll end
up copying your new drive back to itself ad infinitum.  I find the
"--one-file-system" option to cp, rsync, or tar to be especially useful.

To reinstall GRUB, refer to the manual:

http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Installation

I'd suggest making a GRUB boot floppy and testing it before installing
GRUB in the MBR of your new drive.  This lets you back out easily if
"something" goes wrong with no risk to your current setup.  The
alternative of "grub-install" will probably work, but if it doesn't, your
system might be rendered unbootable.

Use the "native installation" method documented at:

http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Installing-GRUB-natively.html

You may want to either print this out or have it in a browser on another
PC since you'll be referring to it while your MythTV PC is down.

The process would be:
  1) Make a GRUB floppy per the instructions
  2) shut down your PC
  3) disconnect the IDE master and make your new drive the master
  4) boot from the GRUB floppy
  5) install according to the above instructions
  6) reboot your PC, GRUB should boot Fedora

If it doesn't work, you can always hook your original drive back up and
your PC will be back where it was until you have time to figure out what
went wrong.

I thought of that, but then realized that you can't.

Your running kernel is going to have the drive mapping all wrong.
Remember that the drive is going to change controllers/position before the
system boots to that disk.

You don't need to chroot to install the boot loader in the MBR of the
secondary disk, though.  And that should work.

The bug reports from RedHat suggested that it was a problem with the newer
DL series from HP.

A coworker is trying to install Suse 8.2 on a machine at home. (We lauded
for his wisdom in moving from Windows :)

He's having problems getting networking going, and is looking for some
directions on how to get it fixed via the GUI.

During the install, he told the installer that the machine is standalone,
but it actually is on a network with a DHCP based router/hub.

What magic buttons does he need to push to get it working?

Thanks,

I just did a trial install (into my now treble-boot
Fedora/Gentoo/Debian box) using the new sarge-i386-businesscard.iso
CD image.

One of the things I didn't like was that it wasn't clear how far the
installer was going to go when I pressed the next button.  In
particular, the repartitioning operation was a little opaque at
several of my decision points.

  I'm running Suse 9.0, so I think it would be similar. Go into Yast,
configure the ethernet card (NIC) for dhcp. Exit Yast. The system will
broadcast a dhcp request, and the router/hub should provide a tcp/ip
address. Once done you should be connected.

File a bug somewhere, then. :-)

Is this what you're seeking?

or is that 32bit (I didn't see anything in the docs)?

It's 32-bit as the kernel is only barely 64-bit yet. I've played with
the mips stuff already a bit. For Indy/Challenge S platforms it's
really stable. On others, well .....

This opening came across my desk today. It's at OHSU, but the job is
on the west campus (Tanasbourne) not downtown. I've only a brief
acquaintance with the two guys who'd end up being your colleagues, but
I can speak highly of the supervisor, Perry.

What needs to jump out at you in the following barrage of buzzwords is
"Solaris administration, with an emphasis on high-performance
computing." Perry said he's definitely looking for someone in systems,
not apps.

People with all these skill, if they do actually exist, probably aren't looking for work.

Subject: [PLUG] GNU Scientific Library
Message-ID: <20040325015246.29189.qmail@web9601.mail.yahoo.com>

The GNU Scientific Library is a remarkable
application. The manual that goes with it is available
as a bound volume (and I have it), and there is at
least one Internet mailing list devoted to it.

Invoking it, however, isn't quite as straightforward
as in the case of some other applications. The program
bessel.c is a "Hello World" type of program to
calculate one value of a Bessel function and display
it.

If shared libraries are used, as you can see, a
LD_LIBRARY_PATH statement must be used for every
instance of executing a binary made by the program.
Could I avoid this by including something in my
profile?

It would be nice to use a makefile to take care of the
libraries. What is a good source of information about
such files?

The answer I get is accurate to only 15 decimal
places, but this error is utterly miniscule. The "make
check" provided with this application passed in every
case. Is this degree of precision about typical for
such applications?

[rtk at dhcppc1 gsl]$ gcc -I/usr/local/include -c
bessel.c
[rtk at dhcppc1 gsl]$ gcc -L/usr/local/lib -lgsl
-lgslcblas -lm bessel.o -o bessel

That's a good thing.  There's not exactly a sane default for things
like partitions, everybody has their own use, and Debian isn't one to
pigeonhole you into some cookie-cutter install.

While Debian will run on anything (literally, what other OS supports
four different kernels across something like 16 architectures?), it's
best to install it for the first time on hardware that you're most
familiar with.  Debian is a better candidate for your main box than
the crappy one in your closet when you're starting off.

So that's Debian.

No, you just couldn't be bothered to check out some HOWTOs.  Yeah, the
installer sucks.  We know.  It's being fixed.  But you only have to
install it once, which is why the installer has sucked for so long.
It's just not something people use regularly enough to matter.

Just get the netinst CD (http://cdimage.debian.org/) and try it again,
this time, with the installation manual handy (there's a big blue link
to it right on the front page for Debian, even).

Try reading the Hard Disk Upgrade HOWTO, it tells you exactly what you
need to do.

Try googling around with the keyword site:debian.org for it.  Odds are

Meanwhile, Microsoft brags about 5-nines and can't deliver on it, but
Debian doesn't care and just happens to do it.  Amazing.

And if you want a last resort and don't mind having an upgrade path
only to Debian Sid, you could try using Knoppix's knx-hdinstall.sh
script to install Knoppix to your drive.

Yeah, those RPM distros belong the same place as those DEB distros.

And this, not to put too fine a point on it, is what gives Debian a bad
name.

*sigh*

Debian isn't particularly easy to install. And configuring X can be a
pain in the ass. There are tools and tricks to make it easier, but if
you don't know about them, they're kinda hard to try. And debian zealots
don't make anything easier.

Just a few notes for anyone else looking to install debian:

1) lspci is your friend. A handy Knoppix cd is also your friend. With
the exception if ISA and older hardware, where you Just Have To Know It,
the two of these can report your hardware very well. Booting Knoppix,
hitting ctrl-alt-f1, and typing lsmod is extremely handy for finding out
what modules to load to get hardware working. 

2) And Knoppix's XFConfig-4 file, while slightly less bleeding-edge than
you might want optimally, works fairly well for configuring X. 
It's good, if possible, to get debian and X to work together as friends.
dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86 (assuming it's installed) will attempt
to reconfigure the xserver. Read the XF86Config-4 file and you'll know
what to put in the boxes, making upgrades a tad easier.

3) apt-get only works if your sources are right. Check out
/etc/apt/sources.list and look on the web on your other computer, or
with a knoppix cd, to find usable sources.list files. Here's mine:

deb http://debian.oregonstate.edu/debian/ testing contrib non-free main
deb http://debian.oregonstate.edu/debian/ unstable contrib non-free main
deb http://ftp-mirror.internap.com/pub/debian/ testing contrib non-free
main
deb http://ftp-mirror.internap.com/pub/debian/ unstable contrib non-free
main
deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US testing/non-US contrib
non-free main
deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US unstable/non-US contrib
non-free main 

4) ignore the zealots. Debian is wonderful in some ways, and the
community can be incredibly helpful and friendly. Sadly, some people
take love of debian too far.

Jeff

Only the Debian installer belongs in the past.  We all agree on that.
It was a good installer back in 1997, but PNP hardware actually works
reasonably well now.  I haven't been following debian-boot, so I don't
know what approach they're taking exactly.  But with PNP being as good
as it is now, I assume there's not much reason for the installer to do
any hardware detection beyond what a normal boot-up would: just
compile everything as modules and let discover do it's job.

You misunderstand.  I mean that it was not clear what the installer
was going to go ahead and do for me.  I knew exactly what I wanted to
do (convert the former swap partition into a ext2 to use as the debian
root).  I didn't want the installer to stomp on the other two
partitions holding fedora and gentoo, respectively.  The installer did
not fill me with confidence about what it was and wasn't about to do.

In fact, in another situation, it got wedged when it couldn't open the
ftp.us.debian.org repository.  It timed out after a few minutes and I
got control back, but I couldn't Control-C out of it.  That happened
twice before I switched repositories to the one at oregonstate.edu.
Basically, I found it lacked sufficient brakes.  I found the "expert"
mode by looking at help and the boot prompt.  That seemed a little
better.  It would be nicer if you could toggle into expert mode part
of the way through.

Otherwise, I liked it.

Ali,

  Yes. You need the pdfpages tarball and documentation and pdfnup_0.96
(that's the latest; I got it yesterday). I tried sending these as
attachments an hour ago but the message was too large for the list. Contact
me directly for copies of the files.

  The latter requires the former and enables you to print pdf docs N-up on a
page, select certain pages to print from the whole thing and -- probably --
let you tile your large map so it can print on multiple sheets of paper.

HTH,

Rich

Actually, as I discovered today, you also need:

  apt-get install xfonts-base
  apt-get install <window-manager-or-your-choice>

and maybe, for kicks:

  apt-get install xterm

You can add the library directory to /etc/ld.so.conf, then run

A retired telco guy who ran some phone wires for me recently is called
Paul Bell (a pseudonymn). He charged me $150 for rewiring all my phones.
His phone number is 503-232-1616. I suspect he will handle cat-5 easily.

But your electrical work needs to comply with safety and building codes,
so I'd suggest getting bids from several licensed electricians for that.

Robert

You might want to look into "power over ethernet" solutions.  Google
will have some information.  The Personaltelco folks use this a lot
because it lets them hoist their access points into favorable
locations without having to worry so much about getting AC up there
too.

According to Oregon law, both high and low voltage must be run by
licensed electrical people. The law makes no distinction. There are
allowances for do-it-yourself, and "limited remodeling" but the law
comes into full effect if you pay someone to help, IIRC.

I've pulled a lot of wire for pay and for trade, sometimes people are
willing trade just to have someone who knows what to do look over their
shoulder. You might find someone who needs your speciality that knows
cabling.

IANAL

I set up a group called "Pdxlinux" on Orkut, www.orkut.com .  Those
of you who are on Orkut are welcome to join so we have all our ugly

Those of you that aren't on Orkut and want to be, send me an email

P.S.:  I also set up the "Church of Linux" which has one other member,
and you are welcome to join that, too.  I also set up "Loners", which
you are invited to try to join so I can reject you.  The membership
counter for Loners frequently goes negative until they reset it.

If you're okay with PDFs...
http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/install.en.pdf

...seems to be it.

A wget -m would probably grab the whole HTML thing if you wanted to give
that a shot.

I'm not a Debian user, though, so I dunno.  :-)

Yeah, probably.  However, your initial suggestion doesn't work by itself.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0403250504120.4604-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I haven't really followed the last few discussions on Linux classes then 
discovered I've been scheduled to teach a one credit class this fall.  The 
class hasn't been taught for a year (I think it is only offered once a 
year) and I've been out of the intro-level learn UNIX/Linux mode for 
years.
   So here I am trying to figure out a good book to use.  My preference is 
to use the man pages and on-line resources but sometimes the students 
prefer something to have and to hold.  Makes it seem more official.

I need to cover actual UNIX variations and should(/will) have access to a
HPUX system for that but the world is quickly becoming GNU/Linux/BSD.  
Yeah the SUN still shines but I don't have access to a Solaris or SUN/OS
box and don't encounter them very often.

What are your suggestions for a good (cheap) book to use for a UNIX Intro
class?  OS installation instructions are less of a need but usage 
(command-line), configuration, and software installation/upgrade are really 
important.


Thanks for your input,
Rod

Rod,

Are you teaching system administration or basic user skills or ??? My
hunch is that my suggestions will vary depending on what you're trying
to accomplish.

Rod,

  Marcel Gagne's SysAdmin book is comprehensive and very well written. There
may be a second edition out now.

I'd suggest "Essential System Administration Pocket Reference" or the full
version, "Essential System Administration, 3rd Edition". They are a few
years old but contain a wealth of information that students could use
after completing your class.

It's been my experience that when the job description is so well defined, 
the people who wrote the requirements already know who the candidate is.  
They are meerly fulfilling the requirements of policies and proceedures 
established by the human resource folks.  I suspect there is a contractor 
or temp employee they want to hire.

I looked at the documentation for pdfnup and found that it has the same
functionality as psnup.  It will combine multiple pages into a single
page, but it won't split a single page into multiple pages.

So I went grepping around on the internet again, and found a ps utility
called poster.  It's actually meant for blowing up a ps file and printing
it on multiple pages, but I thought that it should work for printing a
big sheet at its real size.

So I downloaded an rpm and a tarball for poster.  The rpm installed OK,
but then segfaulted when I tried to run it.  The tarball ran OK and 
produced a 16-page ps file that gs chokes on.  

So I'm back to square one.  Maybe I can use ImageMagick to split the
map into pieces.

I can say with 99% certainty that such is not the case with this
opening. In my original post, I tried to provide the exegesis of this
job description: Solaris admin, with emphasis on high-performance
computing.

OGI hasn't been part of OHSU all that long, so my experience as an
OHSU employee is admittedly limited -- but fwiw, anything official
coming out of OHSU has gone through (at least) four layers of suits, a
couple in the IT organization and a couple in HR.  It's also my
experience that each suit layer is additive, so a job description will
only grow as it moves through the approval process.

Complain all you want about the length and breadth of the job
description; it's still just a help-wanted ad for a Solaris admin. In
today's job market, the salary is pretty competitive.

PLUG finally relinquished their hold? Last I saw they had moved out,
but not deleted the group. Good to know. (Note that this is **NOT**
anti-PLUG. See how I complimented them.)

  What is this current MS virus that purports to be a notification about a
mail account problem or something similar? I get dozens of them a day that
slip past the postfix filters. This has been going on for several weeks now
and this surprises me.

  Anyone?

I think Bagle is one of them.  There are quite a few varients of it as well.

  Thanks, Mark. They seem to be hanging around longer than prior malware.
Too bad they don't take down the infected systems. That would stop the

Subject: [PLUG] Swap usage keeps increasing
Message-ID: <1080244287.4743.38.camel@d8qbcf21.comcast.net>

I'm running Suse 9.0 Personal, XD2 environment. I have to reboot every
once in awhile because I eventually run out of swap. I once thought that
I had narrowed it down to cupsd, but I have found that it isn't the only
contributer. I posted my findings to a larger group, and was told to
just wait for the 2.6 kernel. Now, I know that Evolution has some
processes that keep re-spawning, and if I kill those processes, I gain
back a little of my swap space. Overall, I am fighting a losing battle.
Is this indicative of a memory leak? There is a memory profiler in the
development tools, but there is no documentation for it. If I increase
my physical memory, will that resolve my problem, or just buy me more
time?

Here are some excerpts from system information:

Linux version 2.4.21-192-default (root at i386.suse.de) (gcc version 3.3.1
(SuSE Linux)
Memory: 254896k/261588k available
Adding Swap: 530104k swap-space 

Right now I have:

Two instances of evolution-alarm-notify.
Eight instances of evolution-wombat, and eleven instances of
bonobo-activation-server.

Sometimes I find multiple instances of nautilus, but killing those is
worse than living with them. It invokes a nautilus-throbber process, and
lots of windows of my home directory pop up.

A memory profiler is a coder's tool; it probably won't help you much. 
The easiest thing is probably to use 'top'--start it an press 'M'
(capital, lower-case).  Pay attention to the RSS column; this stands for
Resident Set Size, which is the amount of actual physical memory in
use.  For reference, here's some of my most memory-heavy processes on my
laptop with 512MB memory and the same in swap:

This are usual.  You're not actually seeing multiple instances in most
cases, you're seeing multiple threads.  2.6 and 2.4 with NTPL threading
back-ported only show one process entry for a group of threads.

Don't do that.

One other possibility is to take it to a blue-print type company and
have them print your image on a large-format printer.  I had that done
a couple years ago at a place here:

   Fox Blue Printing & Graphics
   (503) 230-1060 1206 SE 11th Ave
   Portland, OR

Not dirt cheap, but also not unreasonable and no scotch-tape seams.

Some other possibilities are listed here:

Subject: [PLUG] Swap usage keeps increasing
Message-ID: <BAY9-F31TgIvvSKXUil00057358@hotmail.com>

That brings to be a sort of related question that I have been wondering.
Between work and home, I have several Linux boxes
(RH 8, RH9 or Fedora RC1 etc...)
When I run  'top',
there is a line on top that said my Mem usage.  It reports
my physical memory size, how much is used and how much
is free.

Some boxes are running more stuff than the other but all in
all not too much difference.  And they have varying sizes
of physical memory (256mb, 512mb and my latest box is 1GB)

But on ALL of these boxes, the usage is like 90% of all physical memory.
For example on my most beefy box:

  Mem: 1030404k av,  981900k used,  48504k free

Is there any reason why the Mem usage is always almost 90% of the total 
size?
On some of these boxes, I don't have anything special running (other than 
whatever
is needed to keep the box going).  At most, I have mysqld, tomcat, apache 
httpd
and that is it.....

I am not complaining since all boxes are running fine but I would like to 
know
just for own personal growth :)   Thanks in advance for any tip etc...

Free memory is wasted memory.  Any memory not used recently by a running
program is used by the kernel as filesystem cache or other buffers. 
Part of the black magic of VM subsystems is deciding when to free memory
used by processes in preference of filesystem cache.  It's frightfully
difficult to make the right decisions.

A small amount of memory is generally kept free to prevent memory
fragmentation, for basically the same reasons a small amount of
filesystem space is reserved to prevent filesystem fragmentation.

Paul, Rich, Jack,

It was too early in the morning.
   This is an Introductory class not a lot of system administration.  I
only want to get into finding and installing software as it applies to the
different methods from tarballs to the many package management and
repository systems.

They'll be doing basic command line, intermediate command line, shell
scripting, and some simple system monitoring (df, du, top, ps, who, etc.)  
I'm looking for a book for the user with a technical background (not
necessarily computer science) that needs to _use_ a UNIX/Linux/BSD system.

Rich you would be a good example of the type of user I'm thinking of (when
you're using your systems not fixing them.  :-)

I have 256MB physical memory, and 512MB swap. Multiple threads, ok, but
should they remain after I close the application? Do you think I just
just go buy a couple more DIMMS?

I'd stop rcd and for that matter, setiathome.  Is that problem that your
swap usage just grows and it makes you nervous or do you find the system
swapping a lot?

FWIW, SETI at Home shouldn't leak memory.  It's fairly mature.  Boinc, on
the other hand, recently had some code added to it to help them track
down all the memory leaks.  :-)

SETI at Home will use a solid 14-16MB of RAM as long as it is running.

This looks like a memory leak since you say it's creeping upwards over
time.  A 768MB total virtual memory space should be adequate for what
you've mentioned.  256MB real memory is a bit low, but not completely out
of the question.

I suspect this will just buy you more time.  It may be easier to simply
boost your swap space if you're not seeing any performance problems.

If you *are* seeing performance problems, then get the memory.

To identify the culprit, try running this for a day or so:

-----
while true; do
    FILE=/tmp/$0.`date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S`
    echo "Collecting process size info and storing it in $FILE"
    ps -e -o pid,command,fname,vsz | sort -n +4 > $FILE
    sleep 3600
done
-----

After it's run for a while do a "diff" on the first and last files to see
how memory usage has changed for each process.  Those with a large delta
for the same PID are likely to be the source of your problems.

Once identified, then you can just restart that program periodically to
avoid the memory leak.

Or just add swap.  ;-)

Rod,

  I don't know whether to be insulted or complimented. :-)

  Anyway, long ago I found a book called, "Linux A-Z" by an instructor at
the University of Sheffield, UK, Phil Cornes. It's out of print now, but
some are available at amazon.com. I found it invaluable to understand what's
going on becuause it was written for Phil's classes in operating systems.

  He covered why filesystems should be partitioned rather than having
everything in /, and all the other overview aspects of linux and other
unices. After having read the Red Hat-specific books to install and
configure my system, Corne's book gave me the big picture the others lacked.
I thought it the best general introduction out there. So, I sent it to my
colleague in North Carolina whom I'm trying to push out the Windows.

  Don't know what is currently available like that since I'm no longer in
that market. Andy Tannenbaum's OS book with minix is probably too out of
date, too. :-)

A compliment for sure.  I think you, like me, would rather be using
computers than fixing them.

I ran into a great book very similar to this.  "Computer Science: an
Overview"(?), Brookshear.  Even lower level than you're talking about.

This is really too low level.  A good read but not where I'm heading.

O'Reilly has a book called "Running Linux" that a friend gave me a
couple of years ago.  Published in '99 (third edition), it was a little
to basic for me, but was interesting enough that I read it all the way
through anyway.  It is very good at explaining why instead of just what,
perfect for my learning style.  I'm not sure if it is still in print.

Good Luck,

Yeah, this is why I go ahead and grab one of the fake packages that
depends on all that stuff, then weed out the cruft in some kind of client
interface before going ahead with the install.

I tried to do this with aptitude the other day, but had no luck hoping
straight to the list of dependencies as I did in dselect, so I used that
instead.

So, in aptitude, how do I just look at the list of dependencies for a
package and pick and choose?  And what about their dependencies?  And so
on?  Do I have to examine each package?

With dselect, I just select a package and a list of all cascading
dependencies are shown to me for approval (with the required and suggested
already marked for installation and any alternatives that provide the same
functionality listed, but not selected).  aptitude didn't seem to do this
for me.  Grr.

I'll monitor for awhile before going there. With a memory leak, won't I
again just be buying more time? No performance issues, but before I
started investigating, I found the system had mysteriously shut down
once in awhile.

Got the while loop running now. Suspicious of rcd as it seems this came

I've got a noisy server that just moved into a working space.  I'd
first guessed it was fan noise, and was set to replace the power
supply, but opening the box, it turns out to be disk whine instead.
What do people like for quiet drives these days?  I'll probably be
buying at ENU, if that helps narrow the field.  Also, probably not one
of the bigger ones, as we are on a tight budget.

I think a handful of O'Reilly Pocket Reference books would be ideal.

They're cheap and you can pick and choose.

Here's my suggested list:
Essential System Administration
Linux
sed & awk

For a one credit course (that's just an hour a week, right?), that should
be PLENTY of material.  Simple concepts, straightforward task-oriented
explanations.

Sample chapters available online.

Google and grep your way around some of the Quiet PC type websites...
they make these drive holders now that insulate the drive away from the
metal of the case, essentially suspending the drive on rubber bands. 
The result is a significantly quieter hard drive.  Of course, it has
been questioned whether or not this will degrade the performance and
life of the drive, as well as whether or not it will cause additional
heating of the drive... but it's worth investigating, I think.

That would be much cheaper, I believe, than buying a whole new hard
drive.

I think in this case, the drive itself (two of them actually) is the
noisy thing, rather than the coupled vibration with the case.
Dampening might help, but it probably won't be enough.

Is it SCSI by any chance? I've noticed significantly louder whine from
older SCSI drives than their IDE counterparts. On one occasion, I was
certain that the SCSI drive would not power up again after powering down
for an upgrade, but it did, and functioned for over a year before I lost
track of it.

What Wil said is basically accurate. A useful utility in addition to top
is the 'free' command, which will show you the total amount of physical
RAM your applications are using, i.e. RAM used for buffers and cache
have been subtracted out. Here's an example output from my laptop:

[kryten steve]$ free 
             total       used       free     shared    buffers      cached
Mem:        512952     500796      12156          0     122104      230816

Swap:       787144      66508     720636

I am running into an odd problem trying to link libtiff during a make.

Any idea what would cause the following error message?

/usr/bin/gcc -o fax2tiff -g -O -I. -I../tools -I../libtiff fax2tiff.o

I think it might be because of Fink, but i am not certain...

Ideas?

Hi,

For the first Linux class at PCC, we use Linux Installation and
Administration by Nicholas Wells, Course Technology:
http://www.course.com/catalog/product.cfm?isbn=0-619-13095-4 because it
covers most of what we want, it is written to the LPI certification
objectives, it includes a copy of Red Hat 7.3 and it is written as a
textbook with instructor supplements.  Also considered were Linux in a
Nutshell from O'Rielly (as a refrence book) and Mark Sobell's A Practical
Guide to Linux: http://www.sobell.com/LINUX/links.html

For Linux Networking we use TCP/IP Network Administration, 3rd ed. by Craig
Hunt: http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/tcp3/  becasuse nothing else comes close.

The Linux Security class was dropped for lack of interest but the Network
Security (Windows and *nix) is filling up and we will use Security+ guide
to Network Security Fundamentals by Cisco Learning
Institute:http://www.course.com/catalog/product.cfm?isbn=0-619-21294-2

You might want to check out the free books, aka "guides" at the Linux
Documentation Project: http://www.tldp.org/guides.html and also consider
the online books from Safari which includes all of O'reilly and lots of
others.

Good luck,
Mike

Take a look at the "Rute Users Tutorial & Exposition" (RUTE):

  Rute (Rute Users Tutorial and Exposition) is a book on GNU/Linux that
  aims to be the definitive guide for new users as well as sufficing as
  training course material, covering both the RHCE and LPI requirements.
  It covers essential theory to UNIX as well as giving practical
  tutorials on all fundamental aspects of Unix administration, from
  basic commands, the theory of TCP/IP, the Linux filesystem, through to
  configuration of mail, DNS, and other servers, through hardware
  configuration and package management. It is not Unix-specific but
  tends to give examples suited to Debian and RedHat-like systems. Rute
  comes in HTML and PDF formats.

Nope.  Maxtor 30gig IDE's of some description.  Ah:

  $ cat /proc/ide/hda/model 
  Maxtor 5T030H3
  $ cat /proc/ide/hdc/model
  Maxtor 5T030H3

It appears I am looking for the Seagate 340016A or 380021A (40 and 80
gig, respectively).  "Ultra quiet operation", or so enuinc.com says.

    I am currently looking to get A+ and Net+ certified, mostly as resume'

years, (Mandrake 8.0 - 10.0,) and a Linux server and firewall admin for the
last two or three months, (at home, my roommate and I have a goofy network

with. Or is it simply more resume' padding? Or is this the right place to
even ask this question? Or are my socks on fire?

I took the silly test only because one of my publishers wanted
me to and paid me to do it. It's a stripped-down A+ test with
Linux questions added. This means that you need to know PC hardware
and architecture even if you never run Linux on a PC. Many of the
questions and answers are silly. My favorite question asked what
I would do if I wanted a process to run more slowly (to get lesser
CPU cycles). Their correct answer was to stop the daemon and restart
it using the nice program. Apparently, the Linux wizards at CompTIA
don't know processes can be reniced without stopping them.

Responding to myself:

Of course I meant "fewer" CPU cycles.

My system has the ST360015A (60GB), which is very quiet. Because of
limited space in my office, I had to put it on top of the file drawer
next to my desk. That puts it at the same height as my desk, and about
three feet away.

The Barracuda 7200.7 series are very, very quiet. After upgrading to
them, I coulda sworn I didn't have drives anymore. :-)

Move over a package, hit enter, scroll down a bit, all the packages it 
depends on, conflicts with, suggest, etc. as well as available versions 
are all there and you can select them from there.  Hit 'q' to back out 
of that screen btw.

hm.  my X server right now is about 24M virt, 14m rss, but I

I'm a little boggled that gnome-terminal is 16m rss.  that's a
little larger than my emacs process, and twice as large as a
full-screen 1600x1200x32 pixmap, and 3 times as large as the
complete works of Shakespeare.  good thing RAM is cheap.

Mine's routinely between the current size and the size of his.  These
don't seem like strange sizes to me at all.  I'm running at 1024x768 @
24bpp with GL.

Hm, apparently all the gnome-terminals I have open are one process,
threads I guess.  I just opened approximately 20+ terminals and the RSS
only grew to 25M.

Oh, I thought your CPU had some good cycles and some that were, say, out
of round or not quite true.

So what DO I do if I want a process to run only on the lesser cycles of my
CPU?

HI,
Well I looked at my shelf and would like to recommend:

A practical guide to Unix by  Mark Sobell

Essential System Administration by Aeleen Frisch

Linux in a nutshell by Hekman

Unix in Plain English by Reichard and Johnson

The last two I have a hard time choosing between as they both are
useful and each has things not in the other.
If I had to choose just two it would be

A Practical Guide to Unix by Sorbell and Unix in Plain English

These are simple enough for Intro level and complex enough to keep on
the bookshelf for my failing memory.

Processor affinity? Send the processes to the slow cluster of NUMA

W32.BEAGLE.x (where x = spawn version).  VERY annoying - if you can, add
to your blacklist: 

support at yourorg.zzz
administration at yourorg.zzz
management at yourorg.zzz
noreply at yourorg.zzz
staff at yourorg.zzz

This will take out a number of them.  The most annoying version, which
has gotten me calls from people outside my organization is the version
where if a person is infected, the virus picks a RANDOM name from the
address book and sends ou SPAM/Viruses from that contact.  As a result,
you get calls like "I don't know anyone in your organization and I am
not a spammer"....(my spam filter sends a nice note back to the spammer)

Hope this is  not redundant info!

  What is this current MS virus that purports to be a notification about
a mail account problem or something similar? I get dozens of them a day
that slip past the postfix filters. This has been going on for several
weeks now and this surprises me.

  Anyone?

Cam,

  The only one not in /etc/postfix/header_checks -- until just now -- was
'noreply'. I got the others.

  This is the most annoying M$virus for a long time. There are so many
benign subjects and common-word, single sentences that it's impossible to
reliably filter them out.

  What's most frustrating -- to me -- is that so many spam come in past
specific body_check filters but the report to the originating ISP is blocked
by postfix on the way out! I've not yet figured out this one.

Thanks,

Rich

Jabber was not exactly easy to setup, but it was easy to use after
that.  It supports a large variety of clients, however, no one client
could handle all the features available, so "best" depends on the
features that you need.

Good Luck,

That doesn't help when the infecting agent (zip file attached to email) 
is password protected. I have yet to see an email virus scanner that can 
open a password protected archive.

Now, I'm not saying that what you are telling us to do is wrong, or in 
any way a bad thing. I just thought I'd add that it's not a silver 
bullet. :)

As Paul and Derek suggested... Jabber.  It isn't terribly easy to set
up, but it isn't any more difficult than any other server, IMHO. 
Editing XML files by hand does suck a whole bunch, though.  It is very
feature rich and quite powerful.  You can do something as simple as just
an IM server (what I now have set up; I disabled my external
transports), or as complicated as something which has a chat server,
user database, AIM, ICQ, MSN, Yahoo, IRC, SMTP, and likely other
transports.

As for an IM client, I'm partial to Gaim.  The Windows port is moving
right along.  If not Gaim, I think Exodus is the most popular.

The amount of resources that X uses depends on your Window Manager. I
remember my disgust with Gnome when I finally noticed that it needed
to use swap with 128MB of RAM; keep in mind this was when the contemporary
release of MS Windows ran adequately on half that much physical memory, &
was (well, still is) considered a resource pig.

If you are concerned with keeping resource use to a minimum, experiment
with other Window Managers. There's more than just the Gnome & KDE
desktop environments out there: for example, aewm has the lightest footprint,
but it is so minimalistic to make Fvwm look feature-rich; my
preference is AfterStep, which not only has a smaller footprint than
the best-known WMs (Sawfish, whatever KDE uses, Xfce, Window Maker), but
has its own set of eye candy competitive with these.

Again, if you are worried about resources, there are alternatives, the
most familiar being rxvt & aterm. Both drop some legacy support which
AFAIK is no longer used (i.e., Tektronix 4014 compatibility), while
adding some eye candy (e.g., translucent backgrounds, customizable
scrollbars).

Then again, as Felix wrote, RAM is cheap: almost anyone can now afford
a Gig of RAM in their home systems (which solves many problems). Yet many
of us do our computing on slender -- if not cashless -- budgets. It
never hurts to consider your priorities with regards with you do with
your computer: if all you do with your computer is surf the web, email
& compose text, then bloat in a WM is not an issue; however, if you
use your computer for resource-intensive projects (e.g., CAD, database,
gaming, etc.), then it makes sense to put X on a diet & allocate the
resources to the project.

After all, customization is one of the strengths Linux (well, any UNIX-like
OS) has over MS Windows.

The Accelerated Learning Center, in conjunction with the PANUG
and BizNix user groups, is expanding the number of low-cost
computer training courses offered in Portland to 40! These
courses will be from 3 to 8 hours in duration (short courses)
and cost from $25 to $100. We'd appreciate your help in deciding
which of the 40 new courses should be offered first and what
days of the week we should schedule. Please complete the

And?  The OP was, if you look, asking about easy to set up/use Windows
clients for whatever IM server he got running.  I think Kopete doesn't
fit in there.  :-)

When last I tried Kopete (about two months ago) it was horribly unstable
and prone to crashing.  While Gaim certainly isn't perfect, it is more
lightweight than most any KDE application and it gets the job done
nicely.  :-)

I use Yahoo, but primarily because it's my employer's choice. Has both
Linux and Windoze UI's. The Linux version is ssh based, and there are
more preference settings. I block anyone not on my buddy list from
knowing I am on-line, so I don't get any annoying interruptions to view

I didn't read this thread from the top, but did someone explain exactly
what the "VIRT" column is showing?  It ain't swap, that's for sure.

On my system, X is shown with 107m in the VIRT column, but I don't have
any swap.

Uh... how's that work?  My window manager is its own process and I can't
see how it could change the running size of the X server process.

the posts are fine (I think, anyway), but you might consider composing a

It's not possible (there aren't enough HT links) to SMP
Athlon64's. Probably cache size difference and stuff, too. Different
socket too, AFAICT.

Erm, AMD doesn't make it simple.  There are actually a couple of cores 
and three kinds of packaging just to keep things interesting.

All are based on the K8 core.  Some have 1MB of L2 cache, some don't.

The Opteron chips use a relatively large package, 940 pins.  They 
contain multiple HT links for ease of SMPing.  They have a double 
wide bus to memory (128-bit I believe).  Opterons require registered 
DDR sticks.  They are released at slower speed grades than the other 
chips and are intended for the server market.  

The current Athlon64 chips are divided into two broad chunks.  The two 
are the Athlon64 and the Athlon64 FX.  The latter appears to be 
something of an oddity.  It is really an Opteron as far as I can 
tell.  The low end, the Athlon64, has something like 754 pins on the 
package and contains only one HT link and has a single-wide memory 
interface.  However, it currently clocks faster and can use 
non-registered memory.

The Athlon FX appears to be a rebranded Opteron.  It is also in a 
940-pin package (soon to be 939-pin for reasons that make sense to 
AMD's marketing department).  I think it also needs to have 
registered memory.  I believe that AMD has disabled the SMP functions 
on these chips.  My only guess is that AMD released these because 
people wanted more performance for desktops but weren't willing to 
pay the premium for server chips.  No real idea.

AMD's road maps waver all over the place.  It appears that in the 
distant future (i.e. in a year or so) that there will only be 939 and 
940 type packages.  The Athlon64 will migrate to that.  One presumes 
that this means the extra HT links and memory bus will be added?  No 
idea. 

Some of the newer Athlon64 chips have 512MB of cache instead of 1MB.  
These are currently relatively cheap for the performance you get.  
Even with the missing memory bus, the memory bandwidth is reasonable 
and the memory latency is quite nice.  The ability to use cheap, 
off-the-shelf DDR400 RAM is nice.  If you need raw bandwidth, the FX 
is more expensive, but faster than an Opteron.

This is about as concise as I can make it.  AMD isn't making things 
very clear at all.  Perhaps their intention is to confuse us all to 
the point where we just buy something :-)

Best,
Kyle

Nope.  VIRT (or VSZ or SIZE) is the amount of memory mapped, regardless
of whether the page is read-only, shared, etc.  Basically, any memory
that could possibly be used by the process without malloc() or brk().
And don't confuse shared memory with SHM, also called shared memory but
is really an IPC mechanism.  Memory is a remarkably complex topic; I've
been reading Kernel Traffic for several years and it's always amazing
how complex it is.

Think about it like a print server.  When you want the print server to
print something, you send it a document and it renders it into something
the printer can understand and sends it to the printer.  The X
client/server model is similar--except for a continuous display model
things get hairier.  If I understand it correctly, it's possible for an
X client to tell the server to keep certain objects around even if they
aren't visible.  Plus there's stuff the X server or window manager
handles on its own, like backing store.  (Is backing store the same as
'save unders'?)  Oh, and fonts are cached server-side too.

The AthlonFX is for gamers.  It is to compete with the P4EE.  Very high
priced, very small market.  A decent chip with the dual-channel memory
bus.

FWIW, the stuff I've read has indicated AMD is going to move all of
their non-server x86-64 chips to a single socket (which means AthlonFX
and Athlon64)... the 939-pin socket, I think?  Real Soon Now, anyway. 
So yeah, within a year.  I'm waiting for that before I think about
upgrading.

The information I've read about the transition has implied the
Athlon64's *will* move to the dual-channel memory bus at that point.  I
would be very surprised if they added the additional HT links necessary
for running the chips in an SMP environment... they want SMP users to
pay the premium for the Opteron chips.  The difference at that point
between the Athlon64 and the AthlonFX, if the AthlonFX survives that
long, will likely simply be additional L2 cache, I suppose.

> Some of the newer Athlon64 chips have 512MB of cache instead of 1MB.  

s/512MB/512KB/  :-)

I think, again I'm not sure (AMD sure is full of no information as of
late) all the newer Athlon64's are moving to the half-meg of cache.

I was under the impression that the Opterons have the northbridge on
die, and that contributed greatly to the increased cost as you
progress up in the n-way chips (there are Opteron 14x, 24x, and 84x
chips for different cardinalities of SMP).  I also seem to recall that
the opterons have three times the I/O, ammounting in something like
12gbps bi-directional.  I found a good (seemingly unbiased) review at
anandtech comparing the opteron 244's with a dual 3ghz zeon, but I
can't locate it at the moment.

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix Loopback
Message-ID: <1080347093.25370.141.camel@localhost>

Hello Everyone,

I hope you might have some ideas about a relay mail server
configuration. Here's the basic idea:

Postfix is designed to relay the mail from the outside, sanitize it for
an Exchange server and the relay the mail to said Exchange server. For
various reasons, it uses Procmail for the virus and spam checking. After
it's finished, Procmail forwards the mail to the final destination. In
this case the Exhange server.

Internet  --->  Postfix Relay Server  ---> (Procmail) -----> Exchange
server

When I pass the mail to the Exchange server, I cant pass it simply as:

  ENV_TO=$1 #Listed just to show that this is a variable for the user
  ! "$ENV_TO"@mydomain.com

I have to pas the mail off as:

! "$ENV_TO"@exchange.mydomain.com
 
If I forward the email using postfix to @mydomain.com, Postfix thinks
the mail is it's own and processes it in a loop forever!

Meanwhile on the Exchange side, it's a real pain to give every user two
receiving email addresses, user at mydomain.com and
user at exchange.domain.com.

How can I pass the mail to the Exchange server correctly without Postfix
grabbing it?

A running kernel?  The very first line of kernel messages indicates. 
dmesg|head or look in /var/log/dmesg.

Check this out: http://www.spenneberg.com/postfix-amavisd-new.pdf

Basically Postfix can write to an external filter, amavisd-new in this case, loop it back to itself, and then deliver it to the internal mailserver.  I have successfully used that very guide to great success.

Or cat /proc/version.  At least it works here.  A gcc version
string is stuffed into the kernel when it is built.

I'm doing pretty much exactly this (where amavis is also running
spamassassin and some other junk).  Works dandily.

Oh, but I'm not passing the mail onto someone else.  I could and it
wouldn't change a thing.

All the K8s have an integrated memory controller... not so much a
northbridge, just the memory controller.  At least, that's how I
understood it.  There may be other northbridge functions in the core...
but things like the AGP are still controlled by the chipset.

Can you trim the quoted material in your posts and perhaps separate your
added material with newlines or something so that your readers will know
what you've added?

They're going to be the same as the kernel.

The closest I think you're going to get is the kernel_version string
embedded in there.  But if you don't know, you shouldn't be anywhere near
the thing.

strings /path/to/module.o |grep kernel_version

I've almost got my wireless working. I can ping and ssh within the LAN. 
I can't ping easystreet.com (my isp).  I  think if I could use the rh
configure tool, I could get it working.  But the driver names itself ra0

Yeah, they seem ok. I think the Dlink router access point, in it's roll
as firewall doesn't like the fact, that for purposes of getting this
damn thing up, I'm not using it's dhcp services.
At first I thought it might be dns problem, but I can't ping out
period.  My problem is that at the moment I need to bring up the device
by hand and then I don't know how to tell it to use dhcp to get it's IP,
etc.  If  I could get it renamed wlan0, then I could use the RH gui
tool.

I can ping out. So I need to know how to use the Red Hat network
configuration tool on ra0, or how to get wlan0 attached to the driver,
or how to write the scripts.

Subject: [PLUG] composing Avery labels with images and TTF text?
Message-ID: <86fzbvrny8.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I was helping my sister print some labels in MS Windows/Word today.
She wants to combine an image (TIFF) and right-justified text in funky
TrueType fonts.  Word sucks, and won't let me flow the text around the
image (the option is greyed out in Word 97).

What alternatives are there in Linux-land?  I've looked at Xfig, which
might work if I could figure out if/how to use TrueType fonts with
it.  I've looked at Kbarcode, but it doesn't seem to provide
sufficient control over the text formating (line spacing in particular
is screwy).

Any suggestions?

Not when you're installing other people's stuff.  The problem was that
I'm using the latest Fedora 1 kernel, and the supplied module was for an
earlier kernel.  Having been bitten once, I wanted to be able to check
it in the future.  I thought that whatever tool worked on kernels would
would work on .o files.  Which is why I formatted my question in way
that you found confusing.

Really, I shouldn't make drivers?  Believe me, I would be really happy
not to do any of this sys admin stuff, but it's a little hard to run
Linux, especially, on a  laptop, without it.
Contrary to received opinion, the man pages, how-tos, and other
documentation are less than radiantly clear.
The point that you and some others on this list don't seem to be able to
comprehend is that if one could ask a really clear question, one
probably wouldn't need to.

Hi,

What is a good Linux distribution for installation on an older P1/K6 
200-300MHz with 64MB ram and a 1GB hard drive?  Something that's not a 
resource hog would be nice, but a GUI would also be preferred with 
something like Mozilla on it.  It would also be nice if the distro is 
fairly up-to-date wrt package versions included.

I run RedHat 8.0 on my power systems (9 is too buggy/quirky for me), and 
have gotten the latest Mandrake 10.0 ISO's to play around with that 
distro.  However, I don't really have any experience with smaller 
distros (save way back when I played with RedHat 6.2).

I have run Win2K on these low-end boxes, and they work fairly well given 
the constraints.  I am not very fond of using MICROS~1 anymore, 
particularly after obtaining a Sony Vaio system with legitimate WinXP 
home/COA installed.  It was such a joy finding out about their wonderful 
"activation" system, which requires you to call MS voice any time you do 
an OS re-install or "substantial system upgrade"...  Seems like the 
wrong direction for MS to be going - making things annoying/nuisance for 
the casual users, while basically doing nothing to stop war3z/pir8's. 
 It also seemed like they got it right with Win2K - XP essentially seems 
like a Win2K downgrade, incorporating the bugginess/"feel" of 95/98/ME...

Thx!

Perhaps a script that has Gimp combine the TIFF image and
the True Type text. The resulting image can then be used
by Word or Open Office to print labels, unless you want to
write your own postscript.

I would recommend a Debian unstable system with a 2.6 kernel.  The 2.6
kernel is really fantastic on old hardware and a Debian system can be
pared down to a couple hundred megs with X.

Slackware 9.1 with the 3.3.6 XFree server from pasture/ and OpenBox3 for
a Window Manager.

IMHO, anyway.

Oh, and when creating a new topic, could you please create a new message
rather than replying to an old one?  Many of us have threading mail
clients that make posts appear in tree view (like you maybe have seen in
usenet?)... when you reply to an email rather than writing a new one,
you leave references to the email you're responding to.

Who supplied it?  Did you get source?

Tool?

I wasn't confused by the question.  There isn't a way to find the gcc
version from a binary module, as far as I know.

You shouldn't be using drivers that aren't from the same source as your
kernel.

I have an ex-girlfriend who knows nothing about system administration and
runs Linux on her laptop.

Just pick the right laptop and distribution and get some help at the
occassional clinic.

They all have different audiences.  How-tos are fairly plain english,
though.  Man pages tend to be written from the system developer's point of
view.

If you don't know what to ask, don't just take a stab in the dark.  If
you'd provided more context, you could have gotten a more verbose answer
(and therefore one more likely to contain useful information).

There are very few circumstances where you should have to check that...
like if you corrupted a filesystem and ended up with a bunch of
directories dumped together and had to sort them out again or something.

Vector Linux is designed for older systems.

Damn Small Linux is designed for older systems.  

Hit distrowatch and see if there's a category for smaller, older 
systems.  There probably is by now.

Hey, I've done that (written my own postscript) before, so don't tempt
me.  Gimp is a reasonably good idea, though.  It'd let me put the text
where I want it.  I'll give that a go.

Any clues how to add a ttf in Debian so that Gimp has access to it?  I
presume defoma is involved, but I've never invoked it manually.

I don't know why I bother, but I believe the original post which you

Well gee, if I had the  source and I made it, would it be likely to be
compiled for a different kernel. Geez, Thimk!

If you were not confused,  why make such a big deal about the format.

Oh, gee, that is so cute.  You have an ex (not totally unanticipated)
girl friend who can do this. What's that supposed to be a toofer, a gurl

This is profoundly stupid.  If you're in the dark, you ask what you ask.
If certain arrogant shit heads don't like it, don't f-g reply.
Which reminds me, I've been told over and over to f-g plonk you, and I

Oh, crap.  I didn't want to write a f-g essay about  my problems, I just
wanted a quick reply.  Not life advice.

There's a really spiffy, but little known tool called "nameif" that
ships with recentish base net tools for Linux. Look it up, it's cool.

Look at window managers instead of full-blown desktop environments.

I installed the Java Desktop to see what it was all about. It uses suse
as it's linux distro. Then I decided I would like to learn PHP which
lead me to installing Apache. In the instructions from the PHP site to
get it all configured I'm supposed to run this line: 

./configure --prefix=/www --enable-module=so

at this point it fails telling me that:

"Error: could not find any of these C compilers
anywhere in your PATH: gcc cc acc c89
Configure terminated" 

I did a find and there is a gcc-lib and a gcc.html but not much else.
The rpm -q does not turn anything up. 

Do I need to install gcc? And if so where is the best place to download
it. It seems there is no clear place to download it. I downloaded
gcc-3.2.2-45.src.rpm from suse's 8.1 website but there were a bunch
others. (I just took the one from the top)

Any suggestions? Am I headed down the right path?

I think I found at least part of the problem. In the past, for various
reasons, I created several user accounts, some were deleted, and later
recreated. Turns out that /tmp/orbit-mel, contained a file that had the
wrong userid listed as the owner. A quick chown command seems to have
helped a lot. Still will monitor for awhile.

  Thanks to everyone, I learned quite a bit in the process.

You don't want a source rpm.  My spouse's 8.1 system has the following
gcc-related rpm's installed:

> rpm -qa | grep gcc
libgcc-3.3-23
gcc-3.3-23
gcc-c++-3.3-23

These were on the installation CD.

Subject: [PLUG] Jammed up installing Debian - Still anyone got a few minutes?
Message-ID: <4065E701.1080300@comcast.net>

OK, I now have GRUB on a floppy, and three iterations of Debian Linux 
for a NetInstall:  Sarge, Vanilla and Netinstall.

Having decided to bite the bullet and start over, I got a fresh pot of 
coffee, hauled my box and monitor upstairs where I have a cable modem 
connection, and began.

First I reset the bios to boot from A only with cd-rom enabled.

I put the NetInstall cd-rom in the drive and began.  It was cool.  Took 
the defaults and chugged along until it started looking for something in 
a compressed file on the disk and basically froze right there.  The only 
option was to hit enter to try again.  After several trys I decided to 
try another distro which might have the required files.  I rebooted with 
sarge in the cd but the box wouldn't recognize the cd any more.

I dug up the GRUB disk that I make the other day, stuck it in the floppy 
and it booted.  However, due to my own ignorance, I couldn't get beyond 
the grub > prompt.

Next effort will be to make boot disks and try that way.  If anyone's 
(stupidly) inside and bored on a day like this and wouldn't mind giving 
me a call, or some advice, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

No.  Just install the binary apache package and the appropriate php
package and make sure you include the LoadModule line in your apache
config (httpd.conf) to point to mod_php4.so (or whatever it's called).

You don't have to compile either php or apache to make it work.

> Any suggestions? Am I headed down the right path?

You're reading instructions to build apache from source, but you already
have a binary apache distribution and it was surely built with loadable
module support.  So it doesn't need to be recompiled.

It seems like there may also be a DNS issue here, postfix is configured
to receive mail that is allowed by $myhostname and $mynetworks, which
has nothing to do with a DNS lookup.  Postfix will do a DNS lookup to
relay the mail, if it is told by the DNS lookup that itself is the
machine to send the mail to, well, it will send it to itself.  Running
an internal DNS server may help straighten this out.

but.. why would this affect server-side memory usage by 50m or
so?  I can see different window managers having different memory
usage in their own address space, but I don't see what a window
manager could do that would consume a non-trivial amount of
memory in the X server's address space, unless the window manager
makes lots of pixmaps, like several full screen images.

customizable scrollbars should be a trivial amount of memory.
translucent backgrounds depends on how it's implemented, but even
if it needs a full-screen pixmap, that's only 8m at 1600x1200x32.

I really don't understand why programs are so memory hungry these
days, other than "RAM is cheap", which gives people license to be
sloppy.  the chat client I use is bigger than emacs in every way.
I'm sure in a few more years, emacs will be the most lightweight
program on my desktop.

I can't remember if this is a win-modem or not, but when your computer
startup and shows the POST information, look for an extra com port
(usually you will have com1 and com2 built in, look for com3 or com4). 
That should be all the information that you need, if it is not a
win-modem.  If it is a win-modem, there are a couple of websites
dedicated to getting the things to work, but not all of them are
supported.

I usually use minicom and trial-and-error to figure out if a modem
works.   Since you are using an ISA modem, auto-detection of any kind is
hard to come by.  I also don't use modems from machines with GUI's
installed, so I don't have much advise for the GUI-centric.

Good Luck,

I have strange feelings about certifications in general and Linux ones
in particular, but:

    -  I think they are useful for people who lack 4 year degrees or
       have their degrees in an area like history or philosophy that
       isn't clearly related to computing.

    -  Certifications are also required or nearly required for certain
       jobs, especially in government and/or education.

    -  Certifications are also useful if not required when dealing with
       recruiters and HR people.

I never really thought certification meant much in terms of skills or
knowledge, but they are useful for certain people in looking for work.
And for this purpose, one is most interested in getting the most respected
certifications regardless in the certification's  "knowledge" value.  In 
those terms, the "+" series of certifications is pretty good.

    I thought I had a speaker for next week's meeting, but 
things haven't worked out.  
    So, we still need a speaker for next Thursday's PLUG meeting:

                    7 PM Thursday April 1, 2004

    So, would anyone like to volunteer to speak?
If so, please contact me soon.  In fact, it might be best if you called
me on my cell phone at 541-730-5285.  

For the record, our current speaker schedule is:

    May 6, 2004  -     We still need a speaker.

It gets even more interesting than already pointed out. How much memory
does your display hardware have? XFree86 will map all of the display's
memory into its address space. The process size will include that in its
size, so if you've got a video card with 256MB of memory on it, the
X-server process will always be at least that large. I suspect the nVidia
driver (as well as the ATi one) also may map some of the memory into the
client's address space too, pushing the size of it too.

You know what a server is? A server controls a resource that clients want
to get to. In the case of the X-server that is the display, and input
(mouse/keyboard/other events). X-clients never actually touch the
framebuffer (the nVidia and ATi binary drivers may modify this, but the
clients can't expect to actually have direct access), they only do so
indirectly though the X-server.

So *everything* that gets drawn, gets drawn by the X-server. Need to draw
a line? Send a request to the X-server to draw a line somewhere. Need to
create a line? Send a request to the X-server, it will do so but likely
the WM will tell the server to add extra windows for the borders. Ever
realize that practically every single widget (button/slider/graphic)
creates a Window structure on the server? Try running `xwininfo -tree` on
a complex window, you might find a hundred window structures, each of
which has to be present in the X-server. Using OpenGL? Know how complex
those drawing commands are? Those are all done on the X-server. Every
little bit of drawing can potentially cause memory to be allocated by the
server, clients have a massive effect on the X-server process size.

This goes all the way to images, any time one is displayed it must be
created by the client then uploaded to the server for display. This makes
memory leaks a very tricky topic. A client instead of leaking memory in
its address space can leak X resources. Every one of those X resources
(notably images) equates to memory allocated on the X-server. A client
can start creating images on the X-server, and lose track of them. The
client process's size doesn't grow since the image isn't kept on the
client. Instead the X-server process keeps growing from the client's
leak. If the client disconnects the server will attempt to free all those
resources, but until it does it can look like the server has a leak not
the client...

I would, except I'm in the middle of moving while it's light out (not
gonna get much sleep tonight, too much caffeine at work on Saturday).

However, I can suggest joining Debian-User and reposting your query
there, you are almost gauranteed a response, especially if you use a
really good subject line.

Apparently I need to do one of the following things:
provide the information it is complaining about not

  I am, belatedly, getting back to using gnucash. What I have not been able
to figure out yet is how to keep each year's transactions in a separate
file. And, if it's possible to do so when more than one year is displayed in
an account register.

  The on-line docs didn't have anything about this. Perhaps you more
experienced folks can pass me a pointer to the answers.

I find that the Models 2121 2122 2123 2124 2125 are not winmodems
and are therefore linux compatible. I will assume that the 2120 
also fits into that category.

Are you using a 2.2 kernel or a 2.4 kernel? uname -a 
will tell you. I think that the 2.4 kernels usually handle
the pnp cards pretty well and should detect your modem.
Run dmesg | less 
and look through the output and make sure that the card was not detected.
If it is not there, a useful tool to start out with when configuring isa cards is
pnpdump. It is part of the isapnptools and will detect the modem
and tell us how it is configured. Just apt-get install isapnptools
and run pnpdump and see if it detects the modem.

Thanks.  Yeah I also found that page, so I assumed that it wasn't a
winmodem.  I was able to fix the problem, minus DNS resolution. This modem
has jumper settings on it and I quess that the I/O settings on the card were
in conflict with those preset by the board.  In order to get wvdial to
detect the modem without having to use setserial was to change the setting
on the bios for the serial ports to auto instead of having set I/O's.  I'm
using wvdial to connect, and just put the nameservers into the resolv.conf
file and rebooted to restart all of the services to make it easy on myself.
Any suggestions? Is there a separate hosts file or something for pppd
through wvdial that I need to add the dnsserver information into?

Michael,

My opinion: Slack. Everything you need, nothing you don't. It has kind 
of an "old school" feel to it; it's that "old school" that ran things 
on what we now consider minimal hardware.

As others said, Jabber is a good choice.  I just set it up for myself
and my reading indicated the the Jabber 2 server is still rather
unstable and 1.4 is the way to go for now.  (Based in part on the
messages at http://amessage.info.)

If you're using Red Hat 7.3 or ES3, I've built RPMs which are available
at http://ftp.nakedape.cc/nakedape/ (also apt-get-able).

The Jabber.org site has a big list of clients:
http://www.jabber.org/software/clients.php

I've been using Psi and Gaim, both of which are multi-platform (although
I haven't actually used them on Windows).  Gaim is simple and
multi-protocol, but doesn't have a lot of Jabber-specific features, like
service browsing, Jabber gateways, admin features, etc.  Psi is
Jabber-only and does have an easy way of using the gateways, browsing,
and admin features, but it's a tad ugly and Qt-based.

Exodus is supposed to be a nice Windows-only client.  I haven't had any
luck with Gabber on Linux.

Your dhcp client should be adding the assigned nameservers from your ISP.

What exactly is going on?

wvdial/ppp normally get the nameservers from the service provider when
negotiating the connection, it then puts those nameservers into
resolv.conf for you. If this is not happening, perhaps there are
permission problems. Are you running wvdial as root?

Gnucash does not yet support archiving transactions into a different

Thanks for the help everyone.  I did a little searching and it turns out
that my ppp0 was not the default route for external addresses.  So I tried
using route add default ppp0.  This worked except that every time that I
connected I had to type this in the shell.  Im not exactly sure what this
did, but according to another forum I removed diald using apt-get and this
took care of the problem.  I'm assuming that a device was set as default
first and was set as a higher priority than ppp0.  Does this make sense?  To
make a long story short I skipped using wvdial and went to using pon and
poff with pppconfig.  Im up and running great now.  Thanks again for all the
input!

Are you running wvdial as root?

Subject: [PLUG] K12LSTP 4.0.1 Fedora on Toshiba Satellite 2545XCDT
Message-ID: <4067DC22.1030406@comcast.net>

I actually got an install and an initial boot complete with the GRUB 
choice of Fedora or Dos.

During install I didn't have a network to hook up to and I believe that 
either there are usually gremlins involved with PCMCIA cards and 
ethernet or I screwed something up.

Now I get hang's when I boot into linux with the following error messages:
***
*This was the first error message when I went thru the interactive 
approve every line boot:*

Pcnet_cs device eth0 does not seem to be present, delaying 
initialization. [FAILED]
*
Thereafter, I get the following error message:

PCI: Enabling device 00:13.0 (0000 -> 0002)
PCI: Enabling device 00:13.1 (0000 -> 0002)
Yenta IRQ list 06b8, PCI irq11
Socket Status: 30000007
Yenta IRQ list 06b8, PCI irq11
Socket Status: 300000011
*
same error messages but got 2 beeps.  I think this means that the PCMCIA 
card

Do any of you Fedora guru's know what I need to do to get my network 
working and my laptop booting.?

The Trendnet TC-100 16 Fast Ethernet card is recognized and has worked 
in other Toshiba installations.  I set the PC Card Controller Mode to = 
CardBus/16-bit following the suggestion of someone who had posted his 
observations on installing Linux to a Toshiba laptop.

It does make sense and until I got to those last two sentences above, I
was going to suggest that you take a look at /etc/network/interfaces and
/etc/gateways to see what was already in there.

Removing diald probably removed some lines added for the configuration of
that tool what was impacting your use of the conflicting tools.

Glad to hear all is working!

I like pon and poff.  I think it's a good and straightforward way to
handle dialup.

But if you can find a way to get the gpppon (or whatever it's exactly
called) gnome panel applet to actually run as an applet, let me know!

(Actually, the friends' machine that is currently on a dialup connection
will soon be moved to a home with a permanent connection, so I guess the
urgency is overstated.)

Ian,

  The last time I printed a report I had no control over the date range.
Given what you wrote above, I must have missed something important here. In
other words, if I have multiple years' data in a single file, how do I print
the transaction registers and financial reports for only a specified time
period?

Thanks,

Rich

You can specify the time period in the "options" button. So after
generating the report, eg account summary. Click on the Options button.
which will pull up the options window. There you will find the date
section. A drop down menu has: Today, current Month, Current year, etc

Hope this helps,

Subject: [PLUG] Internal DNS
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.52.0403291450160.13321@shaft.bitmine.net>

I have two questions today to pose to the gang.  They will be in separate
messages.

I find myself, for the first time in my experience, in need of internal
DNS.  I have a local DNS server that is providing lookups for my clients
and also doing primary service for the domains served out of the local
datacenter.

I need to have name resolution for internal hosts that do not have public
addresses.

The one caveat is that the domain to which these devices believe they
belong is wildcarded to a single address.

What's the best approach here?

Should I set up a separate internal DNS server that just serves local
info or is there a way to serve that local info only to local clients from
the same server as the public DNS?

Is there a way to serve "domainless" name resolution so that a host "foo"
can resolve to an address or do I use a domain zonefile and rely on the
"search" parameter of the clients to add the domain name?

Not a hostmaster by trade, so whatever you've got could probably put me on
good reading.

Thanks.
J.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.52.0403291455450.13321@shaft.bitmine.net>

I have an internal database server that is serving information to a series
of CGI applications on a public webserver.

The database username does not correspond to any local username on the
database host.  As it stands, I'm doing passwordless "trust"
authentication from the Postgres server to the internal network.

Is there a way to configure postgres such that trust authentication is
only used for certain database users and others are going to use pam or
another authentication method?

Am I misunderstanding the postgres authentication model?

Thanks.

[Caveat: I have no idea what is best.]

I am using bind9's "views", e.g.:

[...]

acl "internal" {
        127.0.0.1; 192.168/16;
};

view "internal" {
        match-clients { "internal"; }

        zone "0.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {

                notify no;

};

Seems to work fine.

This is how I implement "local" dns.  Have a local dns server for local 
resolution.  No dependency on a name server that might need to be broought 
down for maintenance or is having network connectivity issues.  You can 
use split views on one dns server to accomplish this, but given the low 
cost of moderately performing hardware an internal dns server is 
reasonable.

the only domainless way I'm aware of is thru host files and keeping them 
up to date is problematic.

Do all the host files need to be the same? If so, why couldn't person set up
link to a hosts file somewhere central, like the file server?

How, then, do you resolve the name of the fileserver?

I don't think it's a very good idea to have your network resolution depend
on network resolution.

I'm all for separate nameservers and zone files for internal and
public.  The public nameserver stays outside the firewall and has no
info about the inside, and can be moved about as you like without
impacting internal services.

Internal machines go on a separate domain name or a subdomain, which is
set as the default domain name.

Sorry for not going into detail, late for class...

Put multiple lines in the config file, for different users.

so for example:
type	db	user				method
local	all	postgres			ident sameuser
host	all	all	127.0.0.1		password

means if you're connecting by tcp/ip from localhost, it asks for a
password. If user postgres is connecting locally, i.e. a unix socket, it
allows it in.

So to use trust for certain users, do

local	all	my_user				trust

rather than

local	all	all				trust

I may be misunderestimating[tm] the problem.

I think that it's best to use password autentication for the
database user account for the web-cgi.

You would have to have the password embedded in one of the
cgi scripts, but you can have that script only executable by
the cgi user and not readable.

It is also best to have the web server on a separate machine
from the database server.

The database server should be on a lan that is not accessable
from the public internet. It should only have accounts for the
system administrator and the DBA. It should only have the
postgres port open to the web server. All other ports should
be blocked from the web server.  (Port 25 for ssh, used for
maintenance, should be only available from an inside host or
accessible via port knocking).

This way, if the web server is hacked, the person would be
in the web server as the www-user (or nobody, if so configured)
and could not:

1. Get into the database as the password in in a read locked
file

2. Get into any other postgres account because all the
postgres accounts are set to password access via the
pg_hba.conf file.

3. Get onto the postgres server itself without somehow
cracking in via the postgres port (hopefuly you will keep
postgresql up to current version).

Good Luck!

The Linux NTFS driver is very very lacking, not having any decent write
support.

*If* knoppix has started using Captive, then you should be able to
delete them that way.

Or *if* you're using a new enough version of Knoppix to have a 2.6
kernel onboard, you should be able to echo 0 > filename to wipe out the
contents of the file.  You can't actually delete it, though.

As Jeme alluded to but didn't explain, the above concept is chicken and 
egg in nature.  The file you require for name resolution requires name 
resolution in order for it to be read in the first place.


Host files were the way to get things done way back when, before DNS 
existed.  I' sure it quickly became untenable when the host list grew to 
more than a hundred or so entries.  Even 100 or so entries is a pain in 
the ass to manage, hence the origination of DNS.


Until last year, I had the pleasure to work in a environment that didn't 
have DNS and relied exclusively on hosts files.  You soon find out that 
Sendmail really doesn't like not having a name server to query against.  I 
mean really really doesn't like.  Doubtless other MTA's share this same 
behavior.

Creating "domainless" names in DNS is easy. I created the names
moe, larry, and curly on a DNS server. Here's the results with
the unimportant parts of the dig output snipped:

# dig @ns1.alcpress.com moe.
;; QUERY SECTION:
;;      moe, type = A, class = IN

;; ANSWER SECTION:
moe.                    1H IN A         208.151.249.202


# dig @ns1.alcpress.com larry.
;; QUERY SECTION:
;;      larry, type = A, class = IN

;; ANSWER SECTION:
larry.                  1H IN A         208.151.249.203


# dig @ns1.alcpress.com curly.
;; QUERY SECTION:
;;      curly, type = A, class = IN

;; ANSWER SECTION:
curly.                  1H IN A         208.151.249.204

Of course, this is the easy part. The harder part is convincing
your DNS resolver that a name like "moe" is fully-qualified
and not in need of "fixing". Sometimes, the RFCs are a curse.

Any chance of getting y'all in one of my DNS classes?

The part of the ntfs file module that supports writing files to the FS
is marked VERY EXPERIMENTAL. When I was experimenting with this feature
about a year ago, I found I could not delete files. I did some research
(there's a NTFS web forum that I found with Goodle), followed the
instructions I found there (IIRC, one had to mount the file system
twice, & then one could cp/mv/rm files in the NTFS space), & I still could
not get it to work. (The developers were trying to keep this functionality
out of the hands of small children, but succeeded in keeping it out of
practically everyone's hands. At the time, I wasn't worried about data
loss, & the warned data loss would have simply been something I could
have entertained my boss with.)

If I had the time, I would have poked deeper into this mystery, but
since I knew how to do what I wanted in other ways, I dropped this line of
experimentation.

Since what you are doing is very risky, why not simplify matters by simply
copying all of the files you want to a non-MS filesystem, burn them to one
or more CDs, then wipe & reinstall the system, & copy those files over? I
suspect (sadly) that this is what you will end up doing.

Message-ID: <86r7vari9l.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

Hi folks, I noticed that Fedora Core 2 Test 2 was released today, so I
naively decided it was time to bootup the fedora option on my
treble-boot (fedora/debian/gentoo) crashbox and see if I could update
it.

I have (heh, had!) apt installed on Fedora Core 1 (which I had updated
a few times, most recently about a month ago), so I naively modified
/etc/apt/sources.list, naively replacing "1" with "1.91", and ran
apt-get update, which seemed to go successfully.  Then I ran apt-get
dist-upgrade and, upon seeing a 25 minute download estimate, I walked
away and worked on something else.  When I came back I found a series
of messages, the end of which looked like:

        [...]
        installing package xsane-0.92-7 needs 370MB on the / filesystem
        installing package yelp-2.5.90-2 needs 370MB on the / filesystem
   E: Sub-process /bin/rpm returned an error code (255)

So, I tried running it again:

   # apt-get dist-upgrade
   bash: /usr/bin/apt-get: No such file or directory

Hmm, that's not good.  Let's try yum:

   # yum update
   bash: yum: command not found

So, it looks like I hosed things but good.  Not that I lost anything
important, this was just a crashbox to try things out on, but
definitely a violation of the "least astonishment" principle.  Is
fedora supposed to upgrade in place like debian, because at least in
this case it didn't for me.  ;-) If so, how?  Also, is my botch
recoverable in any practical manner or should I punt to new iso's?

Thanks all!

In short the answer is yes, you can do that. Postgresql's authentication 
model is capable of a great deal of precision.

You're looking for the pg_hba.conf file in /etc/postgresql (though this 
may be elsewhere depending on how it was installed.)

add a line that look like

local  database  username                           md5

or, for a remote database

host   yourdatabase  yourusername  ipofhostconnectingfrom  ipmask  md5

instead of for a specific user or database you can use the keyword all, 
and instead of md5 you can use "trust", "reject", "password", "crypt", 
"krb5", "ident" or "pam" for the various ways of storing passwords and 
asking or not asking for them. "password" stores it in plain text so 
should probably be avoided, I recommend md5 as the best method for 
passwords.

You'll need to make sure you either add the user or reset the password 
for the user again after you've changed the pg_hba.conf and reloaded 
postgres in order for it to store the password in the right way.

Also, when adding lines there be aware that it is a set of rules applied 
in order, so be sure to put your lines that allow stuff before the 
default lines that deny everything from everywhere.


The "createuser" program is useful for the creation of postgresql users 
btw.


I do recommend using passwords instead of just "trust" for web apps, it 
makes it so just anyone who may gain access to your local network can't 
automatically have access to the database, they'd have to also manage to 
get the password. It may not be much more, depending on how you store 
the password on the client side, but it is at least something.

I hope that was the information you were after.

Using apt/yum to upgrade from FC1 to FC2-test2 is NOT A GOOD IDEA(tm) ;-)

Using new ISOs should clear out the various potential problems with
the jump to a SELinux enabled kernel.

I just happened to "make a mess" of my laptop earlier this week. Rather
than take the wimpy route of letting the installer "automagically" fix
it for me, I tried to fix it by hand. From memory, I made sure I had
the policy, policycoreutils, policy-sources, and checkpolicy packages
installed.

Next, run the following commands and then reboot:
	
	cd /etc/security/selinux/src/policy
	make load
	make relabel


If things are still horribly broken, try rebooting with the following
parameters:

	selinux=0 enforcing=0

If you still have a problem after all of this, it is not related to
SELinux ;-)

Try the Insert live-CD http://sourceforge.net/projects/insert/

It comes with the Captive drivers (as well as a bunch of useful tools),
and fits on the business card CD's.

Good Luck,

I play DVD movies with Ogle. After inserting the DVD,
I open a command window and type "ogle," which gets it
started.

I have heard that Ogle can be configured to start
automatically when a movie DVD is inserted. I think
such information can be placed in .oglerc. But I don't
know what the command is, and there isn't much
documentation on the Web. Does anyone know?

Ed, no offense intended, but this reads more like an advertisement than
your usual announcements and comes across rather exploitative for a
community posting.

Here's a paraphrase of my reading of that post:

"Why yes, I have the answer to your question.  Here is a quick
demonstration to show that I do, in fact, have the answer.  If you pay me
some money, I'll give it to you."

If it were the normal convention on this list to, say, bid for answers, I
wouldn't have blinked... but usually answers are given freely; either in
full or in reference to explanatory documents.

Unfortunately, Linux jobs aren't immune from being shipped offshore. 

I'm going out on a limb and prophetize that IT offshore mania will soon
come back and severely bite many companies. Unplanned consequences of
intellectual property and trade secrets being ripped off will sting. In
some cases, the bite will be lethal.

The real pain will come when the back doors planted in returning
offshore software are remotely opened by lunatics hiding in caves or
spider holes somewhere in the world. A simple mouse click or push of a
button could render the victim company instantly broke and with empty
disks and databases.

Far fetched you say. Consider this. Most IT groups that aren't yet
pounding the pavement looking for work because of IT offshore mania,
spend precious little time walking through and inspecting software. When
IT offshore mania hits, the expensive programmers with years of
experience are likely shown the door first. After all, the rational of
IT offshore is cutting expenses.

So who's going to walk through and inspect returning offshore software
looking for devious back doors? The boss? I don't think so. It takes
skill and time for understanding software written by others. Few in
today's IT industry have the skill or the time. Those who may have the
skill are probably pounding the pavement because of IT offshore mania.

I'm thinking something to do with the automounter, so a search under that

The product from Hawking Technology is by far the cheapest, but I'm

any additional information or recommendations.

It's no surprise to me that you would take it this way. Another
way of interpreting it is:

"Creating domainless names on a DNS server is easy. I'd tell you
how to do it but there's little point given that DNS resolvers
make it very difficult on the client side. The resolver
behavior is unlikely to change and make this easier in the future
because we have the legacy RFCs that must be followed regardless
of whether they make sense. I'd love to have you in one of my
DNS classes so you can learn the beauty and horrors of DNS."

Hmm. Just downloaded it.  Captive sounds perfect but
captive-install-acquire is not present.  So I copied the files
manually and it just hung there.  I'll try again later.  

The "echo 0 > badfile.dll" sounds scary.

Couldn't you go back to being a dinosaur and mount the network share
using the IP address of the host file server, instead of the name?

It might work.

Assuming you would have installed the Mandrake RPM for it, check to make 
sure it's installed with the following command:

rpm -qa | grep samba

This can be run as a regular user, and will return all packages with 
"samba" in their name.

If you don't get anything (i.e. the prompt returns without listing any 
packages) then samba isn't installed, and you need to install it.

My system returns the following:

$ rpm -qa | grep samba
samba-server-2.2.8a-13mdk
samba-client-2.2.8a-13mdk
samba-common-2.2.8a-13mdk

So, assuming you want the same, and the first command didn't return 
anything, the following command (as root) will install the same packages:

urpmi samba-server samba-client samba-common

If your system is configured properly, it will ask for the CDs it needs 
to find the packages, and install them.

Once that's done, smb.conf is in /etc/samba

It's well commented. In addition, there are excellent docs at www.samba.org

Good luck!

Russ

There are two effective methods of which I'm aware that will completely
exempt one from the policework of others:  Don't participate in any
communities that might have standards or police yourself to the highest
possible standard.

If you can think of another, let me know.

But really, isn't it great that the only negative effect of "policemen" in
this environment is annoyance rather than threats, violence, and
deprivation of civil liberties?

Policemen without that kind of power are better described as "advisors" or
even "friends".

Scarier than a delete?  You're just writing a "0" to the file instead of
emptying it.  The effect is a file that doesn't DO anything... how's that
scarier than no file at all?

No, you're either right or very, very close.  Thanks.

For some reason, it didn't occur to me to have more than one line for each
type (local, host, etc.).

I'm not seeing anything in the docs about the order in which these are
processed, though... For example, I'd like to trust one user and md5 all
others.  Would that be
local	all	all	md5
local	all	my_user	trust
or the reverse or something else?

As I said, policemen with the authority of law are MUCH worse to have
around than people who just politely let others know when they'd like to
see behavior change.

(But, of course, we need police with the authority of law and power of
violence in order to maintain property relations so that some can have
very much while others have very little... no way around that.  No cops,
no capitalism.)

Russ:

FC2T2 should probably be installed on its own disk, and probably will
not upgrade well.  This is pre-alpha code, and compatability with past 
and future versions receives no attention at all.  The only thing they
expect to work is upgrades from FC1 release to FC2 release.

Given recent traffic on the fedora-test list, I suspect Fedora Core 2
Test 2 is extremely hosed.  *LOTS* of people cannot even manage to do
a clean install on a plain vanilla FC1-proven machine from distro disks.
And the help they are getting amounts to "you are stupid".  

I posted a hundred line rant about testing mis-management on the test
list ( which is probably another reason not to read it :-) ) but I will
not subject you to it here.  While I like the way Redhat/Fedora does
a lot of things, the testing process may be broken.  Unless you want
to put up with a lot of bugs and a lot of abuse, you should avoid it.

In the larger sense, the 2.6 transition does not seem to be going well,
and we are getting a large influx of computer users from Windoze these
days.  So a lot of the old hands are stressed out, and are turning into
YASholes (YAS="you are stupid").   Maybe we should plan something fun
to help us chill out.

Now, rpm -q samba-client or rpm -q samba-server or rpm -q samba-common

  Are folks adding spf records to their dns zone files? Aracnet did so for
my domain when I asked this morning. The format is simple:

domain_name.tld		IN TXT	"v=spf1 a mx ptr -all"

  With this in place, spf-enabled MTAs can verify that mail supposedly from
your domain name was sent by a defined mail server at your IP address. Seems
to me this will help reduce spam once spf records are generally implemented.

Subject: [PLUG] How dangerous is handling my own mail?
Message-ID: <20040330205716.GI3539@peak.org>

I just opened up port 25 on my firewall and configured exim so that
mail sent to me at my (zoneedit-DNS'd) host would reach me on that
box.  Cool!  Then I shut the port again because I have the general
impression that handling mail is a lot harder to do safely than
serving up web pages and the like.

Is that impression correct?  Assuming that exim's configured not to
accept or forward mail that's not to known users on my machine, how
much risk is there in opening that port?  Only ports 22 and 8080
(which the firewall passes to 80 internally) are open now.

I'm running Debian Testing.  I'm nothing close to a security expert,
but I do keep up with Debian security updates.

BTW, there's not much motivating this beyond "fun".  The
mailforwarding feature zoneedit provides is enough; I don't "need"
to handle mail myself.

Thanks,

--Eric

Message-ID: <20040330205724.GA23860@kippered.herring.org>

I've got an 8MB ATI Rage XL PCI graphics card on my web server. It has a
440FX mother board with dual Pentium Pro 200 processors. I'd like to
step up to a 32MB graphics card (gotta be PCI, no AGP on the 440FX), but
cannot find /any/ manufacturer whose specs include the PPro as a
supported processor for boards with more than 8MB of RAM.

I plan to install RHEL WS 3.1 on this system, so compatibility with RHEL
would be strongly preferred.

Any pluggers have a PPro w/more than 8MB of video RAM working? If so,
what card and what linux distro?

There's a script mentioned in the page you get when you start X... I
don't think it was captive-install-aquire, but was something like
captive-mount or startcaptive.  If /dev/hda1 isn't your NTFS partition,
they suggest copying the script to your home directory and editing it
from there.

Actually, I think it should be better to cat /dev/zero > badfile.dll,

change the size of the file.

But why does it sound scary?  :-)

  I took my MTA internal to my domain to cut down on spam. When my ISP
handled it, too many messages were addressed to their IP address rather than
mine. Since their mail server is trusted by my network, all the spam came
through. Now I aggressively filter spam with postfix and I'm much happier
with the results. Frankly, it doesn't matter if you run exim, postfix or any
other MTA as long as you understand how you have it configured.

If it isn't configured properly, yes... it is fairly dangerous.  But if
it reasonably configured (and tested) I don't see too much risk.  I've
been handling my own mail for quite a while now and haven't had anything
bad happen :::knock on wood::: ...no spam sent through it, no DoS
attacks, no exploits exploited.

I like the idea. I just haven't been able to reconcile how it would be 
best to set up in my environment.

All of *MY* email from dimstar.net comes from my server at 
mail.dimstar.net. But this is not the problem.

My kids and my girlfriend live elsewhere in Oregon, and have a different 
connection to the net. They have email addresses on my server, and pick 
up from mail.dimstar.net.

However, due to restrictions, they must send through the provider they 
are connected to. So their dimstar.net email will come from a 
centurytel.net mail server.

It just doesn't seem proper to list a centurytel mail server as one of 
my spf records.

Yes, I could set up a vpn connection from their house to mine. Or I 
could set up a mail server at their house that forwards to the 
centurytel server. Seems like a lot of work.

These folks have very simple networks. Hardware (netgear) firewall, with 
Windows machines behind them. They are 100+ miles from me, so when 
things go bad, I can't just drive over on a whim.

So. My question remains, what's the best thing to do? I'm sticking with 
no spf records for now.

I did that to all my domains a few months back. However, I've not yet
done what's necessary to have my mail servers check SPF on incoming mail.
Too much cool stuff to do - so little time.

It seems to me until spf is really everywhere, it's useful only in
'grey' emails... the ones you send to SA for testing.  I've read SA
won't have SPF support until version 1.70, so... I'll live without doing
any SPF stuff for a little while longer, I think.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0403301457170.20151-100000@uplinknetworks.dyndns.org>

I just got this nifty watch from ThinkGeek:

http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/watches/5eec/

It has 512MB and I'd like to install Knoppix-STD on it (which is just
under 500MB).

http://www.knoppix-std.org/

Does anyone know of a good HOWTO for taking an ISO, moving it to a USB
drive, and making it bootable?
Thanks,
~M

If you want 3-D to work well without any extra effort, look for a
Voodoo-3 card.  I don't remember seeing any 32Meg PCI cards, but I know
they made a good 16Meg card.

The dual PPro that I set up does have AGP (440LX/EX), and the 16Meg
Voodoo-3 card that is in it works very well.  I'm running Debian Sarge
on that machine.

Good Luck,

I'm "doing" (translation: not done) it with my own config of
Debian. So far, I find the hardest part is getting the bootloader to
work right. After that, it's pretty breezy. Personally, I'm going with
the "big fat initrd" approach, because that avoids excessive flash
writes/reads.

my instinct is that web servers are a lot more "dangerous" than
mail servers, and ideally any web server accessible by the world
should be outside your firewall.  if the web server just serves
static pages, then there's little risk, but few people want to
serve just static pages.  (and many of those people will still
use something like apache, which introduces a large amount of
complexity unrelated to static pages.)

mail servers are pretty innocuous these days.  after many
embarrassing security problems in sendmail (like the Morris Worm
in 1988), people in the 90s decided it would be a good idea to
design MTAs with a not-so-cuddly view of the internet and pay
careful attention to paranoiac security issues from the start, so
you have MTAs like postfix and qmail that have simple and robust
security models based on separation of privileges.

I think right now the main problem with mail servers is spam, and
sometimes DoS attacks.

... I'm just amused that the Morris Worm was a Big Deal, and it
motivated people to attack root causes of security problems.
it's 16 years later, there's a minor worm outbreak every week,
and people are spending an awful lot of energy on band-aids.

You'll probably want to mount your filesystems with noatime too.

I don't know what restrictions are in place on the centurytel.net
network, but they're typically limited to outbound port-25 sessions.

If so, have you investigated opening the msa (587/tcp) port and
configuring your mail server to accept/relay only authenticated users
on that port?

That's the way I have my mail server setup at home. Others can send
through it by using SMTP AUTH over SSL. Most mainstream mail clients,
Eudora and Outlook included, will support AUTH and SSL.

That way, all dimstar.net mail could be relayed via the official
dimstar.net mail server.

I've thought about it. The problem becomes one of annoying my users. 
Invariably, I end up forgetting one little detail while I'm setting 
things up, and my whole family gets pissed off at me for breaking 
things. Even AFTER I explain that this is more secure, etc. etc. yadda 
yadda.

Sometimes, family can be the worst customers.

What I'll probably do is configure it to work that way at home, then 
impliment it at the remote sites. Taking copious notes throughout so 
that I am less likely to foget a step.

Thanks!

The only thing that wasn't completely clear from this email (though it was
quite explicit in the logs and didn't even require a look at the manual)
is that when you use the "view" directive, ALL zones must be within views.

Works great now.

Took five minutes.

I like the looks of the "Xincom" and the Linksys the best.  At least
Xincom gives a semi-plausible explaination of how they achieve load
balancing from the Internet towards the user network (round-robin DNS
responses, evidently).
What I don't understand (and perhaps they are not promising this) is how
load balancing occurs with non DNS-driven traffic.  Do they propose that
if you have 3Mbps cable and 1Mbps DSL that downloads will reach say,
4Mbps?

Until hearing how it works, I would be somewhat skeptical of how robust
the failover capabilites are for either product.  In the absence of
Internet routing protocol, how does the router know when one connection
goes down?  A simple case of the ethernet cable being uplugged should be
easy to determine.  But how often does Comcast/et al have problems where
all you do is lose link light to the cable modem?  I imagine that the
router could send some form of proprietary keepalive to say, some black
box of the manufacturer's on the Internet.  If the keepalive fails, then
the router could presume that the cable modem has failed.  But my imagined
scenario seems somewhat contrived.

One other concern about outbound "packet" load balancing.  Potentially the
packets could be taking wildly divergent paths if sent to two different
providers and arrive at different times.  When they arrive at the
destination, it seems packet reordering may occur.  Would any bandwidth be
wasted by TCP receiving out-of-order packets and requesting
retransmission?  Reordering wouldn't be an issue if instead some sort of
flow-based load balancing were used instead of per-packet.  But then you
would not get any higher throughput than any single one of your
connections.

It is an intriguing concept- would love to be multi-homed to the Internet
at home :)

I've got a script that pings two gateways and the next-hop from each
(you'd need to add static routes for the next hops) and fails over
between the two.  It's not terribly sophisticated, but seems to work.

I once installed a Hawking Technology switch.  No big deal.  Worked fine
for the couple of years I had to deal with it.  That's a pretty generic
piece of hardware that's pretty hard to screw up, though (yet I've seen
many do just that).

That sounds like driver problems more than anything.

And what's with all the posts without marked quotes?  What clients do that
and why?

In that case either order should work, as they are both explicit allow 
rules, however I'd still suggest putting the trust before the md5. The 
rules are processed in order, so the first one it hits that it matches 
will be the one it prefers.

Yes, it is.  However, if nothing else, make sure you are never an open
relay.  Search Google for open relay test for sites that will test
that for you.

You assume correctly, there's not much risk.

Oh, right... make sure you never provide that kind of a useful public
service, else some people will block all mail from you and make so that
others block mail from you as well.

Pardon the sarcasm, but it should be infinitely clear to everyone by now
that closing relays hasn't done anything to decrease the amount of spam.
It's just made it harder to send mail from outside your home network.

Actually, it's done a great deal.  The vast majority of spam comes
From relatively few sites, most of them open relays.  If your mail
administrator isn't on the ball enough to block these sites, that's
your problem, not mine.

Can one run an open relay and not be used by spammers?

Well, not in this case. Read carefully: I'm going with a huge initrd
to avoid excessive flash writes/reads. In other words I load the
entire operating system into RAM and never touch the flash again. (Or,
if I wanted persistancy, rsync it back or something.) So, noatime
doesn't really matter.

Certainly not when everyone else's relays are closed.

But what's the harm in some of your bandwidth being used for spam when it
is also being used for legitimate email?

We're not going to beat spam by locking down every mailserver in the
world.  That's just an absurd notion.  Better to open up our servers and
beat the spam by potentially effective means.

Just checked the mail logs on one of my open mail servers... no messages
there I don't recognize.  It's been open for a couple of years.

So I guess it IS possible.

I've turned off all relay checks and I STILL block better than 99% of spam
with spamassassin.

The relay checks aren't doing anything.

The problem is that open relays are used much more by spammers than 
legitimate email.

How many people use open relays to send legitimate email when 
travelling?  I suspect very few.  Most people just use their provider's 
  server with SMTP AUTH.  Or they use the local server.  Or they use 
webmail.  I don't know of anyone who keeps track of public open relays 
and uses those when they need to.  Not to mention the big problem is 
ISPs that block outgoing SMTP; an open relay doesn't help with that.

I run spamassassin.  It catches practically everything.  I disabled the
blackhole list checks by scoring them to 0.0.

> How long have you been fighting spam, Jeme?

I don't fight it, I just ignore it... I use some programs to make it
easier to do that.

Spammers will find a way to send so long as it is profitable to do so.
Nobody wants to make it more difficult or expensive to send email, so the
only way to decrease the profitability is to make the email yield no
sales.

The current methods have already driven spam to become largely illegible.
Clients that automatically load data from the internet (via URL or
otherwise) are probably the biggest problem at the moment as they make the
content unfilterable.

Is it truly open?  Does it have a static IP address?  I am surprised 
that it hasn't been scanned and used by spammers.  Can you give out the 
IP address?  I am curious if it has been detected by the open relay RBLs.

Where's the evidence of this?  You can point to particular open relays
that were overrun with spam, but that's only because the rest of the
relays have been closed.  Oftentimes they are FORCED closed by the
extortion and coersion tactics of self-appointed "cops".

I can point you to a couple of people that leave their relays open so that
they can send mail from anywhere with any client or even hand-inject it if
need be.

Yeah, that's a whole other insanity with the same cause.

This idea of making the network less generally useful to fight some
particular use is ass-backward.

The false-negatives really go down with them turned on.  And
bl.spamcop.net[1] only lists what's been spamming within the last two
days.  Their de-listing policy[2] is a little more complex than that,
but it's still a pretty decent list.

Was that by happenstance or by design?  I don't object to the bandwidth

Back when I reported spam, I saw lots of them that came through open 
relays.  That may have changed with spammers doing more direct sending 
and using zombies to send it out.  Nearly all relays are open because 
they were misconfigured.

Are they public where they can be scanned?  An open relay on a 
non-standard port should be pretty safe from being found.  Same for one 
that gets started when needed.  I don't see much point to a public relay 
when a private one works just well.

Except that spam makes the network less generally useful by breaking how 
mail should work.  For example, I had to take down our secondary MX at 
work because it was feeding in spam and generating lots of worthless 
bounce messages.

That's not consistent with the mail I'm receiving at all.  Baseless
conjecture, really.

The relay checks don't count for more than 2 or 3 points, tops... and my
false negatives (three or four per week) usually score below 1.0 (due to
abused negative scores).  Hence, if you add the relay checks to the -2.5
(the score of the one false negative I received today), you'd still end up
well below my threshold of 5.0.

Spend a little time tweaking your scores and adding some rules and you'll
see how pointless those checks are.

I don't know if I'll ever convince you how backward and destructive
authoritarian systems are, though.  You'll just have to come to that on
your own.

I'm not quite sure what the referrent is for "that", but I'll take a guess
and tell you that the openness of the relay was by design.

Well, that's just it.  You take the pains on one side or the other.  Do
you bother with good, effective spam filtering (which takes care of ALL
your spam, regardless of source) or do you spend time securing your mail
server and setting up authentication for SMTP and SSL to make sure the
passwords don't get yoinked and so on?

Oh wait, you're going to do the first ANYWAY, so why bother doing the
second?

That's a fool's argument.

What's the harm? I've seen it first-hand. When I worked at Pyramid the
mail servers were configured as open-relay, which was the default. One
night they got discovered by spammers, who relayed messages to sets
of addresses with millions of recipients. The entire mail system 
ground to a halt and the sysadmins spent literally weeks dealing with 
bounces and hate mail from people following the address trail. I believe
they told me they were getting roughly 300 messages per hour. Once they
were discovered it took months for the relay attempts to die off. For
weeks they were getting hit with several relay attempts per minute.

The issue isn't just stopping spam, it's also about leaving yourself
vulnerable. There is absolutely NO legitimate reason to allow 
unathenticated relaying through any mail server.

Now that the spammers have virus-infected home PC's to relay through the
problem isn't as bad. I'd say my personal mail server typically rejects 
only three or four relay attempts per day.

Claiming it's OK just because you've been lucky so far isn't a very good
argument.

That's a relatively new development.  Used to be that ALL mail relays were
open... that's what "relay" means.

Is it "misconfiguration" or just default behavior not boarded up with
extra administrative work that inconveniences everyone equally, spammer or
otherwise?

The point is that a public one can be used by everyone and a private one
can't be.  I don't do it for MY benefit, but for the benefit of others.

Mail should work by picking a mail server and saying "deliver this for
me".

What does "feeding in spam" mean?

I don't understand why you had to shut down the service.

This is a result of closing all the other relays on the net.  If EVERY
mail relay was open, the spammers wouldn't have to focus their attention
on the few they can find and exploit them.

Those who use others' relays are bottlenecked down to a few and those
servers are ground to their knees.  This is a direct result of the push
for closed relays.

The harm isn't in the opening of the relay, but in the closing.

I'll grant that that can be argued from either side, but the point is that
the closing has OTHER negative effects, while the opening has ONE
potentially negative effect.  That negative is the potential use of the
relay to send spam, but I don't think there's any evidence at all that
closing relays has decreased the amount of spam on the net and I think you
can easily demonstrate for yourself that filtering is quite effective
without checking the source of the email.

Think about it.  Spam is unwanted email CONTENT.  It only makes sense to
filter it by content.  You don't want to stop receiving mail from certain
servers, you want to stop receiving mail of a certain type from ANY
server.  So deal with the real problem.

So everyone should have multi-homed email for failover?  Unauthenticated
relaying helps people who cannot reach their usual mail server to send
mail across the internet.  The more open relays, the more redundancy in
the system.

On how many mail servers do you have accounts?  I think I might have
access to two.  That's not a whole lot of options.  And they're BOTH in
Portland, so if there's some kind of catastrophic power failure, I'm
screwed for outgoing email.

There is ONE reason to close your mail relay... and it's not a very good
reason because it's not particularly effective at solving the problem it's
attempting to solve.

> Now that the spammers have virus-infected home PC's to relay through the
> problem isn't as bad.

Right.  Closing relays wasn't the answer in the first place.  It was a
kind of temporary stop-gap with serious unintended consequences.

Now, if we implement solutions to the spam problem that actually address
the real issue (mail content that we don't want to see), then they can
have all the mail servers in the world and it still won't impact us.

Then it's definitely time to open that sucker up.

I am not claiming it's OK because my mail server hasn't been ground to
dust.  I'm claiming it's OK because it's a public good with only one
potential drawback that you, yourself, admitted isn't much of an issue
anymore.

I assumed it was contrived, but I guess we really should ask...

It'll definitely make a difference in how much heckling we do and I don't

I'm sorry about the ambiguous "that" and by that I mean did you just 
open it up on the Internet and forget about it or did you do anything to 
obsfucate the relay or make it non-attractive to people who send spam.

It isn't default behavior with the newer MTA software.  Also, it is a 
carryover from a different world where network connections were 
unreliable and required relays to bridge the gaps.  Now, servers can 
have single functions: receiving email for a domain, or sending email 
from users.

How many other people have ever used it for relaying legitimate email?

How does the client pick a mail server?  With DHCP, the server can use 
IP addresses.  Or it can be entered into the client, where 
authentication isn't much more burden.

The secondary server had weaker spam checks than the primary server. 
The primary server has to trust the secondary and can't do any filtering 
based on source.  The spammers deliberately connect to the secondary to 
bypass the filters.   Also, the secondary server does not know which 
mailboxes are valid so it accepts all the email.  When the primary 
rejected the email, then the secondary is obligated to send bounce 
messages.  It is a waste to deliver bounces to those you don't want or 
can't get them.

The one you're referring too had a header saying Apple Mail v2.6 or something.
MS Outlook does it. Otherwise it triggers a spell check on the quoted material.

If you have to ask, it is a clear indicator that you have not spent
much time dealing with lawyers. This not a snotty, sarcastic comment.

I've never "experienced" such things first-hand, but I have had a front-
row seat a couple times in the past. I don't know about the speaker's
particular problems, but as SCO has proved it is worth our while to 
listen closely when this topic is discussed.

It is fun to heckle SCO, for example, but the truth of the matter is that
the threat is real. Such litigation, even if it is COMPLETELY STUPID, can
chew up millions of dollars in legal fees.  This sort of thing is best
avoided if at all possible. It is in our best interest to listen carefully.

I'm on the public record as using VRRP. I'm also a CISCO customer.
I thought about that a lot as I read this rather humorous page on
"Intellectual Property Quagmires":  http://www.openbsd.org/lyrics.html

No, it just means either your system isn't configured the way you thought

It doesn't prove anything. I'm alive, does that prove that I'll live

relays.

I agree that the spammers will continue to be creative in their broadcast
attempts. It doesn't mean that we have to make it easy for them. And this 
other comment of yours would indicate that you don't comprehend the real
scope of the problem:

It has nothing at all to do with the spam that comes into my system. It
has everything to do with facilitating the production of spam for OTHERS,
and theft of services. A typical spam message will have a body with less
than 2K bytes. But when they drop it on your system for relaying they
include as many recipient addresses as possible. How will your bandwidth
stand up to the overhead of DNS lookup, SMTP handshaking and message
transmission of a few million such messages per hour? It takes the spammer
a few minutes to hand off, but your mail server will be hostage until it's
finished processing all those addresses.

> Unauthenticated relaying helps people who cannot reach their usual

Email was never intended to be a reliable, immediate transport. How many
telephones do you have? If your phone system goes down how do access
another system?

Wrong. It effectively eliminates one problem. The fact that there are
others doesn't mean we should re-open this one. We don't stop vaccinating
for measles because people still get sick from other sources, like colds.

You haven't been paying attention, have you? I didn't say three to four
relays, I said attempts. In my experience, if even one of those attempts
succeeded my available bandwidth would vanish and my mail server would
be rendered useless. And I'd be spending the next week cleaning up after
it. I'd say that's a good reason to leave it alone.

You actually added

No, it proves that you can do whatever it is you have done and live.

The funny thing about the apparent misconfiguration is that I didn't give
the name of the mailserver without the relayed spam in its logs, but one
that DOES have relayed spam in its logs... so I'll have to look into that
tomorrow and figure out a) how the relayed spam go there if it's not open
or b) why it wasn't open to Ian when he tried it.

How long ago?  I didn't see anything like massively injected relayed mail
until well after the closed relay movement started.  After all, if you've
got pipe enough to inject millions of messages, you got pipe enough to run
your own server or just bounce through a few hundred others.  You're just
shooting yourself in the foot trying to pump it all through one that
probably can't take the load.

If we provide an easy way for them to send their mail, they won't be
looking for malicious ways to do it (e.g., planting trojans) and we can
focus on eliminating the real problem -- unwanted email in people's
inboxes.

So you don't filter spam coming into your system?

Theft of services?  We're talking about a few megabytes a day per server
tops.

For you, it's all about making life tough for other people and staking a
claim that "what's mine is mine!"

That's not only unproductive and uncivil, it's downright antisocial.

Right... a few million messages per hour... over thousands of mail
servers.  So you're implying that billions of spam messages go across the
internet very hour?  I think you need to reassess the scale, there.

So would you use software that relayed mail openly, but allowed you to
prioritize authenticated messages?

Well, it can be.  So not let it be?

My telephone doesn't use a robust protocol with diverse network paths and
multiple layers of packet and datagram retransmission (OK, a couple, but
not as many as TCP/IP across the internet).

Why can't we have something BETTER than what we had before?  I know the
telephone system is broke-ass... that's one reason why I like the internet
better.

I don't want something as good as the phone system.  I want something

That one "problem" isn't spam, though... it's a product of your greed and
selfishness.

To me, your whole idea of "theft of services" is a problem.

We don't vaccinate for measles and tell people that it's going to cut down
on colds.

The folks that are out there yanking network connections from those who
would allow their mail relays to be used freely are not doing so to
protect those people from "theft of services".  They're doing it to "fight
spam".

Tell me, why would you encourage people to close their relays?

How narrow is your bandwidth?  I can understand limiting the use of
services on extremely small connections with mission-critical services
behind them.  Is that your situation?  And if that's really your concern,
why do you care if other people open THEIR relays?

> And I'd be spending the next week cleaning up after it.

If the server did it's job, what would you have to clean up?

> I'd say that's a good reason to leave it alone.

It might be a good reason for YOU to leave YOUR server alone, but your
whole argument revolves around a selfish idea of withholding services for
your own potential personal use.  It has nothing to do with other people
openning their relays nor does it include any argument against a general
notion that there should be as many open relays as possible on the
network.

I know I'm beating this dead horse.

  In light of this week's InnoTech show at the Convention Center, and that
too many clever and talented denizens of our group here are
under-/un-employed, I thought it worth while to pass on this message from
another mail list, one devoted to the jocr OCR project.

  Pooling talents to produce products that the blind could use to get
readable materials would be an effort with a high degree of satisfaction
even if it produces little or no income. Perhaps output to a voice
synthesizer would also be possible so printed material could be transformed
into braille or speech.

  My mother depends on the taped books she borrows from the library at the
New York Lighthouse for the Blind. Having access to FOSS software on
commodity hardware would allow many more publications to be made available
to those who can no longer see.

I was just listening to a BBC Radio 4 broadcast about the trouble the blind
in Britain have in locating books of any real quality to read. I wondered
why they weren't simply using scanners, OCR, and braille displays and/or
speech synthesizers along with printed books. It turn out that the basic
software sold to the blind is very expensive. This is $1000
(http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_news/nr_OB7S.asp), not including a
speech sythesizer. (It's thousands more for a braille display).

It seems to me that someone could string something together using gocr, or
similar, to give the blind affordable software and hence better access. I
don't know if anyone is working on such a thing, but if so, you might want to
contact the BBC broadcasters at intouch at bbc.co.uk. The website is
http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/intouch.shtml.

Oliver,

This is a good idea. It was discussed just recently on the blind Linux
list (blinux). It seems that gOCR was not well known. Perhaps it will be
better known now. I'll forward your message to the blinux list.

I'm deaf-blind myself. The reason why OCR software for the blind is so
expensive is that it includes all kinds of bells and whistles for people
who are not computer literate. There are in fact inexpensive packages that
just use an OCR engine as a front end for a word processor.

Don,

  I, too, am delaying activating the filter in postfix because I do not yet
know all the implications. There's been a lot of discussion on the postfix
mail list about this so I'm sure the archives have the information.

  My hesitation is centered around the question: what happens to messages
passed to the SPF check in postfix when there is no SPF record to be
checked? Are they automatically rejected because they fail? I suspect not,
but I do not yet know.

While it is not Cat and the Hat, and I do not know "Turkey in the
Straw," it is a pretty close match to "I have a Wocket in my Pocket." 
Perhaps Dr. Seuss copied Turkey...  it is an odd book for Dr. Seuss. 
Remember Seuss did not have one cadence, but several.  Having read over
20-30 different Seuss books (I did not know he wrote that many) I can
attest that he has more flow to his words, once you get it, than most
authors.  When you read the same book 40-50 times, you notice these
things.  "What was I Scare of" and "Too Many Daves" clearly do not flow
like Cat and the Hat (Scared is fairly close to Ziegler's as well).

Oddly I am merely cleaning my emails at the moment, *and* I just read
Wocket to my daughter last night.  I can tell you it is the same
cadence.

I find it more annoying that due to mainstream press things become -like
or "derivative of" too easily.  In older times we called them styles. 
Yes a unique author may have started it, but others followed and it
occasionally improved the art.

Another example is Monty Python.  When doing Improv, if you dared do a
British accent, people would later refer to a that "Monty Python
Sketch," as though there was never any other absurdist comedians in
England.  While this is somewhat of an honor to Monty Python, it also
stifles a possible flow of art.

This impact OSS as well.  While there are plenty of half-ass projects
that do the same thing, people often say "you do not need to redo that,
Y already works."  Well, I think the broad spectrum of OSS improves
gradually, even if the project in question sucks rocks.

I have gotten to the point where I do not like Visio for much.  It

pretty.

Use PowerPoint/Open Office Presenter and use simple boxes and lines.  It
produces content that fits one one screen (so you must do different

Around 1998. And you're still not grokking. If I'm a spammer who's
relaying through someone else, I'm not injecting a million messages - 
I'm injecting a single message with a million addresses. This expands
to a million messages on the server that has to do final delivery, i.e.,
the relay server. That's one of the major reasons they do it - it
offloads the processing onto some else's system.

The easiest way for them to do it is to pay for and use their own
servers and connections. What's wrong with that? Now that we're
forcing them to do that instead of relaying, we ARE concentrating on
the unwanted email problem. That's why they use infected systems,
target secondary MX hosts and play word games to bypass heuristic tests
in spam filters.

> So you don't filter spam coming into your system?

I never said that. I do three levels of spam blocking/filtering. I have
certain default tests configured in sendmail along with my own blacklist,
I use Spasm (www.nspasm.org) as a milter with aggressive settings, and
I use spamassassin.

> Theft of services?  We're talking about a few megabytes a day per

This whole discussion is pointless because you don't pay attention. First
of all, if we assume 2K per message and a million messages that's more
like 2GB. Per relayed spam. Plus it kills your mail server. Mail is
generally queued in FIFO order. Your server won't process anything else
until it's dealt with those million SMTP handshakes. Hopefully your
server is configured to limit the number of simultaneous processes, or
your system would trip over itself and die. With DNS lookups, ident
processing, connection filtering on the other end, etc., etc., it takes
finite time to process each message. Then there's the bounces, the flames,
etc. I don't know about you, but I have better things to do with my time.

> claim that "what's mine is mine!"

Right. That's why I pay for this out of my own pocket, and provide free
and unfettered access to my friends, all my relatives and my neighbors.
It's about being responsible.

> So you're implying that billions of spam messages go across the
> internet very hour?  I think you need to reassess the scale, there.

You think so? In Taiwan they estimate that 2/3 of all email is spam.
I've heard estimates of US spam being 50% or more of all email messages.
One estimate was that spam accounted for over 1/3 of all Internet traffic
(TCP/IP packets, not email messages).

> That one "problem" isn't spam, though... it's a product of your greed and

My greed and selfishness. I see. Preventing someone from hijacking my system
for their own profit is an indication of MY greed.

Years ago I operated a UUCP node. I provided feeds to anyone who wanted
one. I relayed whatever came through. I do what I can now, within limits.
Communal resources are great, until someone starts abusing them. Then
those few ruin it for everyone else.

OK, fine. We vaccinate for flu. But because people can get the flu from
other strains we don't throw away the vaccines we do have. Sheesh.

You know, you seem to have this notion that what I pay for and maintain I
should freely share with you and anyone else who wants to use it. So tell
me, do you have a car? Why don't you leave the keys in it in case someone
else has car problems and needs to use it to make a quick run to the store?
I share pretty much everything. But because of abuse, people have to ask
first.

I have to wonder about your real motivation for encouraging open relays.
Given that anyone with an Internet connection has access to a server that's
more reliable than their physical connection there just isn't any valid
justification for having open relays.

That isn't the default behavior of Apple's mail.app. It actually has

Message-ID: <1080764755.6423.94.camel@secure.psislidell.com>

So, I've been waiting for evolution to solve my stupidity problem of
sending mail to lists with the wrong FROM address.

It does not look like it is going to happen soon.

So I was planning on modifying Postfix to do it for me.

Has anyone does this already?  It seems I need a map (transport?) that
rejects ("6.6.6. You are a moron zot") relay access when it seems
something like this:

FROM				TO
zot at domain1.com 		@domain2.com
!zot_list at list.domain1.com	plug at lists.pdxlinux.com
zot at domain2.com			@domain1.com

Or something like this.

The first line might be bad for a lot of folks, but I have recipients
that I need to come from the right address that I can define pretty
easily.

The second one is a common issue.  I might even prefer something that
rewrites the FROM line to the appropriate one like this:

FROM_Orig		TO			FROM
zot at domain1.com		plug at lists.pdxlinux.com	zot_lists at list.domain1.com

But that could be difficult.

Any pages, hints, ideas?

Thanks!

If I know nothing about logic, then you can't read.

I didn't WRITE anything about the future.  I simply stated that it is
POSSIBLE for a particular situation to arise.

So refuse messages with long recipient lists.

The problem with totally closing relays is that it's too drastic a
measure.  There are other ways to achieve the goals you desire to achieve.

And it turns out it has nothing to do with blocking spam.

No, that isn't the easiest way because it results in blackhole lists and
the like.  It's a losing strategy.  Since they are exploitative profiteers
(i.e., capitalists), they will find another way to make their profits at
the expense of others.

They are NOT forced to use their own servers, man!  They are using trojans
and bots.

But they're not using "their own servers and connections" as you assert

It's trivial to deny large recipient lists with just about any MTA in
modern use.

PLUS?  You mean THEN, right?  This is a consequence, not a separate
action.

I think it might be a couple dozen.  I've never had a system crash under
load... even in large production environments.  I've had pipes saturated
and systems become I/O bound, but those issues eventually resolve
themselves even if you don't intervene.

Why are you even bothering with the bounces?

The flames are a cultural problem caused by the closed-relay community
that wants to blame the mail server operator for the content that passes
through it.  That can change easily.

You have a very narrow view of "friends, all my relatives and my
neighbors".  Any one of those categories could emcompass the entire
planet... especially when we're already narrowed down to human beings on
the internet.

> It's about being responsible.

If you really were concerned with the things you wrote about in this
message alone, you would simply limit the number of recipients a message
may carry or require authentication at certain times of day or process
authenticated mail at a higher priority.  But no, you choose the
all-denying policy that is most destructive to the social fabric -- most
selfish, most limiting to others and most ruthlessly authoritarian.

I've heard all kinds of estimates, too.  But two things lack in your
comments:  citations for quoted numerical data and real numbers instead of
ratios.

It may well be that 1/3 of all internet traffic is spam, but that doesn't
show that there are billions of spam messages sent every hour.  You'd have
to know how much of the traffic is email, generally, and then you could
guess based on the number of packets required per email message on average
and kind of come up with a number from there, but it would be prone to
some error.  If you could show somehow that spam was half of all email
messages transitting an internet backbone (and intranet email just can't
count here), then you'd have to further show that there were 4 billion
total messages each hour.

Billions are really big.

It's so deeply ingrained in your thought that you can't even express it
without using derogatory terms for shared use.

You're not JUST prevent spammers from using your systems.  If you only
wanted that, you could implement any of the several schemes I've
suggested.  No, you're preventing EVERYONE ELSE from using your services.

Well, you once had the right idea.

It's only RUINED if you go to negative extremes to prevent the perceived
abuse.

I haven't even HINTED at the POSITIVE responses one could have to systems
being rendered unusable due to congestion:  larger pipes, better hardware,
faster resolvers, etc.

There are plenty of people who would suggest that, if a person cannot give
enough to satisfy others, that person is just not giving enough.  I can
think of one guy in particular... but they nailed him to a tree when he
suggested it.

Uh... no.  The folks at spamcop.net who go around coercing ISPs into
yanking other people's internet connections because of open relays are NOT
doing it to protect those poor souls from "theft of service".  They're
claiming it stops spam.

So will you join me condemning all people who want to close other people's
relays under the guise of spam prevention?

Honestly, you're kind of dodging the issue here.  I'll take up your
comment in a moment, but I have to restate this:  You make arguments for
closing your OWN mail server, but why encourage others to do the same?
What is YOUR motivation THERE?

Personally, I think it's a subconscious desire to squelch sharing and
public-mindedness because it is a threat to the system that allows you to
sit in a superior position to other people and wield power over them.  But
maybe you have a different understanding.

> So tell me, do you have a car?

No, I'm not elderly or otherwise infirm.

> Why don't you leave the keys in it in case someone else has car problems
> and needs to use it to make a quick run to the store?

I lock my bicycle when it's not at home.  Mostly, that's because there is
no assurance that I will ever gain future access if my current access is
lost.  It's kind of a sick little game based on fear and deprivation that
allows those with control of massive resources to keep folks like me in
permanent desperation.

Internet pipes aren't like that AT ALL, though.  You sit atop the valve
and can reclaim it for your own needs whenever you like.  There's really
no reason NOT to allow public use so long as you can assure the use when
you need it.  You can do this with preferential routing and stuff.

> I share pretty much everything. But because of abuse, people have to ask
> first.

There's no reason for that with your mail server.  Your only real argument
here is that mail with large recipient lists bogs down your system.  So
limit recipient lists and give authenticated users higher priority.

Of course, it's not that easy because the self-appointed cops have control
right now and they will get your connection yanked or add you to a
blackhole list if you do anything as helpful as that.

> I have to wonder about your real motivation for encouraging open relays.

My real motivation is a subversion of conventional ideas of authority,
property, and control.

> Given that anyone with an Internet connection has access to a server

> valid justification for having open relays.

I don't get your "given" at all.  If your "physical connection" is
wireless, then your access is redundant all over town.  You just have to
go a few blocks further down.

And, quite frankly, you're the one proposing the restriction, so you're
going to have to do better than "no reason to not restrict" as a
justification.

I'm always going to argue for the least destructive policy.

Order Allow,Deny

*****

Dave,

Thanks much for the post.
I already got one response.

Here is the full explanation of the project, as I originally promised.

If you can forward this out to your list also,
that would be much appreciated.

Thanks again,

Charles Stewart

****************************************

Much Thanks to Mr David Mandel for his fine post in response to my verbal/
phone request for PHP/MysSQL Programmer Assistance.
And what is really novel, is that I got behind on my promise to Dave for an
out-line of the work that needs to  be done, and he heroically made a very
effective post even with-out my outline.
Those are rare & precious standards. Thanks again Dave.

And for broader context, we have our own "Dedicated Server", so we have root
access to work on this project.  Also: I live in Sandy Oregon, just East of
Gresham; & so that is why I am focusing on the Portland/Linux-Group.
Further, I am 49 years old, the main organizer of this project, & I am a
dedicated open-source supporter, and linux supporter.  Also, I have been
studying such matters as constitutional-law & social-justice for well over
20
years.  I am dedicated to bringing power to responsibly self-govern to the
common American People.
  One of the main focuses of our much broader work here, is to defend the
open-source community from monolithic big-brother schemes from such
centralized-authority advocates as Microsoft & Mr Ashcrofts so-called
"Department of Justice".
But these caviets being said, here is the basic outline of the work I/we
need
help on. The basic web site is at:
http://vote.inetgov.net/

Potential programmers can go ahead & register to vote there. As can be seen
here-in, this is an effort at constructing cutting-edge on-line
direct-democratic electoral/voting process.  This is the focus here, because
the US Constitution commands that the common American People are the Supreme
Authority from which All Government Officers ultimately derive all of their
governing authority.
So, the task at hand, is simply to organize the common people to voice their
constitutionally-lawful demands for accountable/open government, especially
in such critically important areas as our "Open-Source Community" & the
survivability of Linux and the Internet in general.

To be more specific, we have constructed a "deep-hierarchy", under which the
whole planet can theoretically be self-governed.  It is my views that
"Strong
Local Government" (free from interference from unwanted meddling from
outside
larger jurisdictions), is both Constitutionally Required & a practical
Necessity.
For each propositional-issue (in our eventually very large & constantly
expanding database), there are 3 categories, which are: "Level of Support"
for each proposition/candidate, "Importance" of the proposition to that
voter, & "Efficiency" (& neutrality) of the wording of the proposition.
All of these elements are designed to be tabulated thru the MySQL Database,
&
displayed in a spread-sheet format; so that each individual can be fully
empowered to communicate his detailed voter preferences to the other
honorable members of his local & larger self-governing jurisdictional
communities.
Ongoing "Votes of Confidence" & "Instantaneous Recall" of elected officials
&
of governmental policies, is an essential sub-division of of the larger
"Level of Support" aspect of this project.  "Weighted Voting", aka:
"Preferential Voting" plays into this strongly.  We are using a scale of 0 -
99  to tabulate our "weighted votes".

That is a quick outline. I can specify more later. I think Ive got a more
detailed outline document some-where, or verbally I can narrow the focus.
It helps much to be on the phone and looking at the web page at the same
time. I can allow programmers who are working with us to have full access to
the domain , & eventually even to our dedicated server.

I have had 2 Oregon area programmers work on this project, for good pay, for

close to two years.  The first one abandoned it with-out honorable concern
for completing it.  He took the money and ran.
The second one was out of contact for an extended time, & he has spent a
very
long time getting things accomplished.  I had become worried that he had
abandoned it. He since has reassured me of his dedication to finishing the
project, & is actively making progress on it. And he seems to have good
explanations for his delays, personal problems & such which happen to us
all.
But it seems clear to me, that he needs some help in completing the project.
This project should have been completed long ago. I know that if a good
competent programmer or 2 or more were working on it steady, that things
would be up & running in a very quick time.  My present programmer says
things are 98 % ready to run. We seem to just need a few minor adjustments.
But I am not a programmer, yet; so I don't know for sure.
And I am sure that there will be "fine tuning" necessary, so that work for
the future could expand dramatically. We expect fully that this project will
be so popular that donations will come in from many local self-governing
communities.  Nothing like this presently exists, & the lost & confused
populace desperately needs forums like this to work-out their own
self-governing solutions.
When donations begin coming in, we will compensate our programmers
generously.  And we can pay a bit for those who can help at present.  We can
easily set-up & host domains as a barter/exchange for any programmers who
volunteer to work with us.
We are in the process of setting up mirror-image web-pages under our
dedicated server, from which individual programmers who are helping out here
can exercise full control.  And one way or the other, we will allow such
root
access as is needed.
I can probably arrange 3 -way phone conferences with our present programmer;
in Lincoln-City, Oregon; & who is intimately familiar with the code.  I
believe he will actively work with us, & that he will be glad to share the
duties of getting everything programmed to work together in an efficient
manner.

I look forward to working with any volunteers on this project.  Folks
dedicated to supporting Linux & Open-Source are preferred.  That may sound
screwy, but Ive seen it play out (in tangible results) too often to ignore.
Advanced programmers who can provide insight to efficiency improvements will
be compensated fairly & promptly; & all who work with us will receive
generous compensation when the donations begin to flow.
Of course; many have heard similar promises before, & are naturally
skeptical.  Thats ok.  But look a the basic work.  Does this look like the
work of an opportunistic scamm-artist?  "By their works ye will know them",
Bible quote.  Ive paid the 2 programmers who worked on it so far,
approximately one thousand dollars, total. I will pay what-ever is necessary
to get this work finished & effeciently functional. And deeply respectful
friendships will be established with those can afford to temporarily fore-go
immediate compensation in order to get it efficiently running soon.

Subject: [PLUG] Module problem: I damaged my thing
Message-ID: <20040331231910.25456.qmail@web9605.mail.yahoo.com>

I seem to have a slight problem. I have a Logitech
Quickcam 3000 which works under Linux, but requires a
compressor module for maximum performance. The source
code for this module (pwcx.o) is not available; you
just have to download it for the right combination of
kernel version and compiler.

The closest match I could get with my kernel version
(2.4.21) was one for 2.4.23. Insmod complained about
it. If it won't fit, use a bigger hammer:

insmod -f pwcx.o

And the performance of the Webcam was good. While I
was browsing the Web, however, my system locked up,
and required a hard reboot. Then, when I rebooted:
Fail! Fail! Fail! Fail! 

I can log into the system, but without the X-server.
It appears that modules are not being loaded. Is there
a way to fix it? If someone wants to see logs, I can
probably provide this information, by mounting the
partition in question with a "rescue" distribution.
The programs in it work, but I can't get information
in or out of it, except with the monitor and keyboard.

I haven't found one that includes a power screwdriver... but my parents
bought me two kits over the last few years.  One is pretty big the other
pretty small.  The big one is a Compaq kit, FWIW.  It included things
like a soldering iron.

> also, what do you consider need tools in a good tool kit?

A nice phillips head non-magnetic non-powered screwdriver with a
medium-small grip. 
I use a Black&Decker power screwdriver, too.  
A magnetic screwdriver is nice, too, to grab screws you drop.  
Cable ties are good to have.
A screwdriver socket set with all the heads you might possibly need
CAT5 cable crimping kit
something to grab those damned jumpers (small pliers, I don't have any)
a daily pill holder to hold screws when you're taking things apart
A wire stripper
Two BBC CDs - one with INSERT on it, the other with AdAware and AVG

I'm sure there's other stuff in there, I just can't think of it now.

I've done a scary amount of PC maintenance using nothing but my Victorinox
Cybertool.
(http://www.victorinox.com/newsite/en/produkte/produktdetails//1-7725-T/1-7725-T.htm)

It has the small Torx(TM) bits needed for Compaq/HP maintenance that I
always seem to forget to bring, as well as enough tools to accomplish most
things, albeit more slowly than if you had the "right" tool.

It's a good addition to any normal toolkit.

I'd like to see a leatherman or swiss-army tool with an RJ45 crimper.

BTW, you see those parcel carrier hooks all over europe.  I'd never
seen one here.

Cut wires with the scissors, insert into RJ45 connector, squeeze each
metal bit carefully down via small flatblade screwdriver.  ;-)

It's not pretty, but it works.  Slowly.  (And yes, this is very hard on
the scissors...)

You'd never want to make this your standard way of making cables, but at
least it's possible.

I'd like to see a Cybertool with a real wire cutter on it.

Updating your kernel may be the best way to go, but without more
specific information, this is just a guess.

Good Luck,

(I have since read that this is not such a wise thing
to do, although in some cases there is no exact match.
It would have been better to install the correct
kernel first.)

So far as I can tell, the modules are not being loaded
when it would be appropriate for the kernel to load
them, on system startup. For this reason, I'd have to
write any messages down on a sheet of paper, at the
present time. (Number-crunching programs still work;
in fact, they are to some extent useful even with the
installation in its present condition.)

It is what I'm guessing, although I have had trouble
building kernels in the past. I already have kernel
sources in /usr/src, however (so the inability to get
online with the installation isn't an insurmountable
problem), which is a positive factor.

I like having a ratcheting screw driver instead of a power screw driver,
it never runs out of power.  Even better, if it has removable tips, you
should be able to get a 1/4 inch drive and a small socket set and
extensions to go with it.  Small bent-tip needle nose pliers are also a
must.  I have ndiags (a Norton utility) on a bootable floppy along with
serial and parallel loopback devices, but haven't really used them in a
while.

Other things that I can think of,

-tube of heatsink compound
-wire ties (use sparingly)
-electrical tape
-cat-5 cable (just get a box of the good stuff)
-cat-5 cable ends
-cat-5 cable end crimper
-rubbing alcohol
-Q-tips
-air tank, or compressor, or both (much cheaper than canned air)
-air nozzle
-4-port hub (as a cheap cable tester)
-exacto knife, or other very sharp implement
-rescue disk(s)

Just to give you ideas, I'm sure there is more.

Good Luck,

Derek Loree

If they'll sell to you, Graybar has dang near everything. 'Course
they're a little picky about to whom they sell. I've gone in with
purchase orders and they still look at me like I'm plague-ridden.

> also, what do you consider need tools in a good tool kit?

You mention a punchdown tool, so you obviously want some telco gear,
like a butt set, etc. Cable tester w/ loopback plug.

Gotta have a "toner" or wire tracer. At least that's what I call them.
Like this: http://www.action-electronics.com/tracker.htm Great for

They have most everything for cabling (data and voice) and a lot of 
other computer stuff too. I just bought a 110 punchdown tool from them 
for $35. They have cable testers too.

I seem to have a slight problem. I have a Logitech
Quickcam 3000 which works under Linux, but requires a
compressor module for maximum performance. The source
code for this module (pwcx.o) is not available; you
just have to download it for the right combination of
kernel version and compiler.

The closest match I could get with my kernel version
(2.4.21) was one for 2.4.23. Insmod complained about
it. If it won't fit, use a bigger hammer:

insmod -f pwcx.o

And the performance of the Webcam was good. While I
was browsing the Web, however, my system locked up,
and required a hard reboot. Then, when I rebooted the
kernel was unable to load any modules.

(I tried making another kernel, but apparently the
damage is too extensive to be repaired in this way.
Probably transferring the data from the installation
is the best I can do.

Linux has been making impressive strides toward the
desktop. But to secure good performance from one of
the most popular Web cams, it takes a diligent search
for a module and a kernel compilation. With Windows,
it's a five-minute download.)
