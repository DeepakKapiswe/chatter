I think Suns default to 9600 8n1.

I agree that setting up the serial connection should be a priority. 
You'll see (and be able to capture) lots of good information.

Jen,
>From what people have said so far in this thread, it looks like all of the
VOIP service providers have problems at times, but work most of the time.
And, Ooma is similar to the others in that way (Quality Of Service).  But,
compared to the other providers, Ooma costs less in the long run.

Cheers,

I tried to do this just now to see what the problem was.

First, bear in mind that the MCL has to pay very close attention to
digital rights management. For example, if the library has bought
digital rights to five copies of a book, only five patrons can have the
book checked out at a time. In other words, you have to check the book
out and check it back in when you are finished with it. This means that
the copies are encoded so that they can only be opened in programs that
respect the digital rights, i.e., that will stop letting you read the
book after your checkout time has expired.

Having said that, I recommend installing Calibre, an open source e-book
reader. It will read Kindle, PDF and epub formats. You should find it
in Ubuntu repositories.

I called the Ask a Librarian line and got a very pleasant fellow who
was helpful in explaining to me how the library's web pages for digital
copies work. With his assistance I tried to download a Kindle book.
When I clicked on Checkout I was suddenly taken to an Amazon page. I
didn't follow through to check the book out, but bear in mind that you
must have an Amazon account and log into it before you can download the
book. I assume there would be no charge, since you would be downloading
it as a patron of the MCL.

Then I tried an Adobe digital media book. This popped up a download
window, and I was able to download the file. However, what it
downloaded was an .acsm file of just over 1K - nowhere near big enough
to be a book. Calibre was happy to open the file, but didn't know what
to do with it. It turns out that you are supposed to have Adobe Digital
Editions installed on your computer, and then double clicking on
the .acsm file will open it in Adobe Digital Editions. The librarian
gave me a link to the download page for Adobe Digital Editions, but
when I opened it in Firefox the Adobe page announced "sorry this
software won't run on your computer."

But the librarian insisted that he had information that Adobe Digital
Editions would run on Linux. Acting on a hunch I went to winehq and
checked the application database. Sure enough, all three current
versions of Adobe Digital Editions have a platinum rating. I don't have
Wine installed on my computer and I didn't want to install it just to
test this. But it appears that you can install Adobe Digital Editions
on a Linux computer via Wine, which will then allow you to read the
book.

I should add that I have bought Kindle books and they opened just fine
in Calibre. But that was *buying* a book, not checking a book out of a
library.

I have used the library2go site for about a year with no problems.  I run
the Adobe Digital Editions under WINE and it works without issue.  I click
on the link, it opens ADE which downloads the book, in turn.

Works like a champ...


The most difficult part is installing ADE to begin with.  It web page says
my computer does not meet the minimum requirements but further down the
page it has a link under "If you have trouble installing Digital Editions,
see the installation TechNote <http://www.adobe.com/go/kb403051>." so click
on the link.  On the page that comes up find the area that says "Manually
install Adobe Digital Editions for Windows "
and download the SETUP.EXE file which will run under WINE.

  (or just click herehttp://kb2.adobe.com/cps/403/kb403051/attachments/setup.exe
)

I knew this was going happen sooner or later--one of my ancient servers
died--Tuesday afternoon, apparently. Fortunately, it was only the power
supply and I had spares.

This junk in my basement is on the order of 7-10 years old and I don't
really have the time I used to have to keep stuff going, much less to do
anything new. But finally I do have time to help migrate away from my
servers, if there are volunteers who could provide the needed hosting

Message-ID: <1320384220.9742.8.camel@Maui>

Folks,

(note -- this is a "resend' after I realized that PLUG was down for a
bit. Forgive me if the message appears twice.)

Just wondering if there's a Linux equivalent to Camtasia, for recording
"lecture"-like demos. I'd like to be able to switch between OOo Impress
presentations and active views of the command line / other admin tools.
If it matters, I think my publisher would be looking for AVI files.

I've heard xvidtune can do such, but don't see any clues from the man
page (or my searches), except some references that suggest that it would
be too crude for production. 

All I can find for Camstudio are Win .exe files. I'm hesitant to run
such (or Camtasia) under WINE, as I suspect the wrappers, etc. would
introduce odd latencies. (If someone can tell me that such fears are
unfounded, great.)

Any other suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Mike

The Multnomah County Library has offered for 2 years down-loadable e-books
to every one EXCEPT those who use any form of LINUX!!!  I have just spent
5 hours in the library to learn how to download a library book.  Most of
the time was with the branch supervisor, who spent a lot of time on the
phone to the libraries Tech Support people. The final answer is "as long
as you use LINUX you cannot use this service of the Multnomah County
Library"

I'm discourage.  My tax money supports this library and the services they
purchase.

If you do install it, be careful who you give accounts to on your

Subject: [PLUG] Off Topic: Victor is looking for a silent "no light"
	programmable thermostat
Message-ID: <CALNOJ_gmovwgnCbWGuJarS2Ff+7tJ0xDSKDTgGoZh3CBksniHw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am writing to this group because I figure there must be a subset of
linux people that are sensitive to extraneous noises and lights, like LEDs
on high tech equipment.  Furthermore, by virtue of the fact that you're into
linux, you may be a bit of a hacker, or have figured out the solution to my
quandary, or know of the product I'm looking for.

I recently switched from oil heat to gas heat.  I now have a fancy
shmantzy digital programmable thermostat.
It makes a popping and clicking sound whenever the heater changes
state.  It also lights up whenever the heater
changes state.  I don't want it to do these things.  My old analog
thermostat just sat there and never made
any noise or generated any light.  However, it is not programmable.

I would like a programmable thermostat that is silent, and does not
light up, and does
not make any noise when the heater changes state.

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

The following goes into detail regarding my concerns and issues with
my current programmable thermostat.

I wrote to technical support of Rheem describing two issues of the
Rheem thermostat.  It lights up at inappropriate times, and makes a
loud clicking noise.  Perhaps they will have a quick fix to
the problem.  The following is what I wrote....



I am the consumer of the product, not the contractor.  I will be
registering my product very soon.  The product is a nice snazzy
digital thermostat with a decent liquid crystal display, but there are
two problems that I hope you can address.  Otherwise, I am really
going to miss my old analog thermostat because it didn't make noise or
light up at inappropriate times.

The thermostat is within view of my sight while I watch TV in the
living room, and occasionally fall asleep on the couch in the living
room.  Unfortunately, the thermostat LCD screen lights up momentarily,
and the thermostat makes some sort of clicking sound when a change of
state occurs in the heating system.  I can't stand the light coming
on, and I can't stand the click sound sounding when I'm not the one
prompting it.  It startles me when I'm watching TV or falling asleep
on the couch in the dark.  I don't like the thermostat "announcing" to
the world that the heater is doing something by lighting up
momentarily and making a clicking sound.  That is why I like the old
analog thermostat.  It did its job without having to indicate to the
world at large that it was doing something.  Is there a way to disable
the light from coming on and the clicking sound from happening
automatically when the heating system changes state?  I hope so,
otherwise a snazzy new programmable 100 dollar plus thermostat is
worse than the old technology of an analog thermostat.

I read the manual for the thermostat, and I figured out how to keep
the LCD thermostat from ever lighting up.  You do this by going into
the INSTALLER/CONFIGURATION MENU to MENU REF 10, and Select Display
Light to L OFF.  While this has the virtue of keeping the LCD light
from flashing on at inappropriate times, like when I'm watching TV in
the dark, or sleeping on the couch, it still does not prevent the
clicking sound from happening.  Another drawback of turning the
Display Light to L OFF is that when I do need it on, it won't come on
unless I go through the INSTALLER/CONFIGURATION MENU and set the
Display Light to L(On).  This is too much of a rigmarole.

Subject: [PLUG] Working with suPHP on Apache 2
Message-ID: <4EB2FF35.9000106@comcast.net>

Does anyone have a good site reference for how to work with suPHP on 
Apache 2?

Using Synaptic, I installed apache2, which brought along 
apache2.2-common and apache2.2-bin.
The version is 2.2.14-5ubuntu8.6.

Next I installed suphp-common and libapache2-mod-suphp which brought 
along php5-common and php 5-cgi.
Both suphp packages are version 0.7.1-1. The php5 packages are version 
5.3.2-1ubuntu4.10.

If I browse to localhost the "It works!" page opens, showing that Apache 
is working. If I change the name from index.html to index.php I get the 
"500 Internal Server Error" error message.

I'm assuming that there must be something different in the way php files 
are handled, or perhaps there's something else I was supposed to do that 
doesn't show up in the installation instructions I've read.

Pointers to appropriate documentation are appreciated.

Thanks.

Jen,

VOIP service providers have problems at times, but work most of the time.
And, Ooma is similar to the others in that way (Quality Of Service).  But,

Just wondering if there's a Linux equivalent to Camtasia, for recording

Sorry, I don't have a link for you but a few simple tips might help you.

When using suphp ownership of files is very import.  I'm not sure what
kind of defaults Ubuntu ships with but looking in /etc/suphp/suphp.conf
will more than likely help you understand things a bit better.

A couple of points:

The docroot directive specifies which directories should use suphp.
This is very handy if you want to use suphp for some directories but not
for others.  Some web applications install stuff in say /usr/share and
that stuff usually does not work well under suphp unless you change
ownership of all files.

There are also directives named min_uid and min_gid, these restrict who
can run php scripts under the docroot directory.

More than likely since you are getting 500 errors this is due to the
user/group of the web pages being lower that what is allowed.

Checking /var/log/suphp/suphp.log might prove to be a valuable resource.

Hope this helps

I think what you're looking for is xvidcap: http://xvidcap.sourceforge.net/

There are only a handful of screencasting options for linux, and most have
limitations of one kind or another (mostly in what kind of video they
output). Here's a short list of the best options:

I'm writing a script to pull some stuff out of /var/log/messages by 
date.  I am having problems finding any entries with a single digit date 
because the messages file dates look like this:
Mmm<space><space>d for single digit dates.  The output of 
YESTERDAY=`date --date='yesterday'|cut -c 5-10`; echo $YESTERDAY gives 
me Mmm<space>d for single digit dates.  Therein lies the problem - grep 
is looking for Nov 3 with one leading space while the messages file has 
Nov  3 with two leading spaces.  Gotta be a way to do this, I'm just not 
smart enough to figure it out.  Pretty sure most of you guys are . . .

I have a Honeywell (TH8000 series).  It is a touch-screen LCD unit.  The
light comes on only when the screen is touched.  It does click.  The noise
is from a reed relay.  I can hear them from 15 feet away, but I would not
call them loud.  Perhaps if the unit were mounted with some form of sound
isolation the wall would not be a sounding board.  I doubt that you will
find any units which use solid state relays, since historically the
thermostat is a switch in the line which powers a valve or other relay.
However, Honeywell now markets a system consisting of a "transmitter" at
the thermostat and a "receiver" at the furnace ($).  I assume that it uses
digital signals.  The relays are at the furnace.  Its purpose it to control
multiple functions (cooling, heating of multiple stages, etc.) over the
traditional 3 wires.  These might be silent.

GNU date will format the output pretty much any way you want. In this 
case,

   YESTERDAY=$(date -d yesterday +"%b %e %T")

Search for FORMAT in the date(1) man page for other output options.

One recommendation Googling showed me was to change the location of 
DocumentRoot to a directory in my home directory. I created a directory 
www in my /home/rsteff and changed the entry in 
/etc/apache2/sites-available from

DocumentRoot /var/www

to

DocumentRoot /home/rsteff/www

After restarting Apache it now looks at the new directory.

That error went away but a new one came up. I added an href to a php 
file that simply calls phpinfo. When I click on that link I get this 
error message:

[Fri Nov 04 10:51:15 2011] [warn] Script "/home/rsteff/www/phpinfo.php" 
resolving to "/home/rsteff/www/phpinfo.php" not within configured docroot


I changed the entry in /etc/suphp/suphp.conf from

;Path all scripts have to be in
docroot=/var/www:${HOME}/public_html

to

;Path all scripts have to be in
docroot=/home/rsteff/www

Now the href runs phpinfo as expected.

> Hope this helps

Very much. Thanks.

I am curious about the form of the docroot line I changed in suphp.conf.
What is the significance of ":${HOME}" in that line?

Hello there,

 : I'm writing a script to pull some stuff out of /var/log/messages 
 : by date.  I am having problems finding any entries with a single 
 : digit date because the messages file dates look like this: 
 : Mmm<space><space>d for single digit dates.  The output of

Some shell you are trying to run:

 : YESTERDAY=`date --date='yesterday'|cut -c 5-10`; echo $YESTERDAY

OK, so shell is absolutely wonderful.  I love it.

But, it can also cause you an unending headache with its rules for 
quoting and tokenizing.  It's smart to stuff the output into a 
variable.  But, then you throw a bit of 'echo' into your shell 
tokenization soup and you think that grep is eating your spaces!

So, let's back up a bit and look at this date space grep soup and 
see whether we can get you on the right track.  Here are some 
problems (or suboptimalities).
  
  1. Problem:  You are not quoting $YESTERDAY and the shell
     is eating your space (before echo gets it)

  2. Suboptimality: You could tell date to give you the string in 
     exactly the format you want.  (Avoid the unnecessary pipe.)

  3. Minor suboptimality:  You used a semicolon rather than an &&.

Here's what I would do:

  fgrep "$( date '+%b %e' --date 'yesterday' )" -- /var/log/messages


How did I get there?

  $ date '+%b %e' --date 'yesterday'
  Nov  3

OK, that looks like the string that I want to dig out of my log 
files.  Let's put that into a variable (the dollar parenthesis 
syntax is a nestable alternative to backticks for creating a 
parameter substitution subshell):

  YESTERDAY=$( date '+%b %e' --date 'yesterday' )

OK, so now, I just want to make sure that I have the right stuff in 
the variable.

  $ echo $YESTERDAY 
  Nov 3

Egads!  Somebody at my space!  (Ate MySpace? I guess it must have 
been FaceBottom.)  What could be happening here?  Well, I have heard 
that shell is picky about quoting, so perhaps I should quote this:

  $ echo "$YESTERDAY"
  Nov  3

Ah-ha!  So, the shell is eating my spaces.  So, what the heck is 
going on here?  This is called word-splitting.

The following is illustrative of what's going as the shell is 
processing your command [0].  Let's assume this:

  $ YESTERDAY=$( date '+%b %e' --date 'yesterday' )

  $ echo $YESTERDAY        # -- you typed this
    echo Nov  3            # -- expands the variable; note the space!
    echo Nov 3             # -- tokenizes, word-splitting here

    The tokenizing is done using IFS.  I don't suggest messing with 
    IFS, although some shell monsters do this.

    Now that the word-splitting is complete, bash calls the shell 
    builtin 'echo' and passes it two parameters.  The first 
    parameter is the word 'Nov' and the second parameter is the 
    word '3'.

    You now see on your screen something that looks like this:

  $ echo $YESTERDAY 
  Nov 3

So, what's different about the double quotes?  They tell bash to 
treat everything inside the quotes as a single shell word.  That's 
all they do.  Nothing more magical than that.

This is an excellent example and argument for getting into the 
general habit of quoting any shell variables.  You never know when 
you might end up with spaces in your shell variables, and this sort 
of problem (and many other, rather more dangerous problems) can 
result from bad shell quoting.

 : gives me Mmm<space>d for single digit dates.  Therein lies the 
 : problem - grep is looking for Nov 3 with one leading space while 
 : the messages file has Nov 3 with two leading spaces.  Gotta be a 
 : way to do this, I'm just not smart enough to figure it out.  
 : Pretty sure most of you guys are . . .

OK, so now, as you can probably see above, the date command takes a 
wide variety of options to control the format of its output.  By 
specifying the format of output you desire, you can dispense with 
the extraneous pipe to the 'cut' command.  This is a small win, but 
in a complex script it can make for an easier script to read and an 
easier script to debug later.

Naturally, being a creature familiar with Unix and comforted by its 
warm embrace, my favorite is:

   date +%s

I notice you are familiar with the --date option, as well.  This is 
wonderfully powerful!  If you have a recent GNU date, then you can 
even see one of my favorite Unix timestamps of all time:

  date +%F-%T --date '@1000000000'

Do you need the single quotes?  Nope.  It's just an old quoting 
habit on my part.

Finally, on another trivial little issue.  You used the semicolon to 
join together a few commands.  There's nothing terribly wrong with 
this, but if the commands are implicitly serial and you do not wish 
to execute the second command unless the first one succeeds, 
consider getting in the following habit:

 YESTERDAY=$( date '+%b %e' --date yesterday ) && echo "$YESTERDAY"

The 'echo "$YESTERDAY"' command will not be run unless the 
'YESTERDAY=$( date '+%b %e' --date yesterday )' command completes 
successfully.  This is a trivial matter for your script, but 
consider the following sort of archival situation:

  MYDIRECTORY=$( get_some_directory_name )
  run_huge_backup_job "$MYDIRECTORY"; rm -rf  "$MYDIRECTORY"

What do you suppose happens if run_huge_backup_job fails?

Oh, and yes, fgrep is just a another variant of grep for handling 
fixed strings.  This can be noticeably faster on large samples of 
input.

Have a great Friday and good luck!

-Martin

 [0] If you want more, go read the section on Expansion, 
     specifically word-splitting in the bash manpage, 'man 1 bash'.

P.S. If you are an advanced shell monster, consider using 'set -e' 
     and 'set -o pipefail' in your bash scripts.

Victor,

I suggest you go to your local ACE, Home Depot, or Lowes, and talk to the
folks there about the type of thermostat you want. Honeywell makes lots of
different models at different price points. I have two Honeywell digital
thermostats, and they do not flash or click....they replaced my old manual
thermostats. Replacing the thermostat is pretty easy - just three wires
that should be color coded - all you need is a screw driver. Be sure to
tell the sales guys you have gas heat.

Good luck!

Mark

it's an environment variable. it refers to the home directory of the owner
of the process. The standard location of an individual user's html files is
in a directory named "public_html" within their home directory. You chose
to call it "www" instead. The "right" solution would be to add your desired
location to the list, rather than remove everything else. Since only you
are likely to be using this system, you have probably broken nothing by
doing it that way.

;Path all scripts have to be in
docroot=/var/www:${HOME}/public_html:${HOME}/www

So the colon is a separator? In the line above are all three directories 
ones from which php scripts may be executed?

Subject: [PLUG] Firefox issue with php
Message-ID: <4EB595E0.3060102@comcast.net>

One thing that I hadn't resolved with my suPHP installation was the fact 
that while I could have an index.html file reference a .php file and 
have that .php file work, I didn't have index.php working. On the Ubuntu 
forum a fellow recommended putting

AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .htm .html

in my httpd.conf file. Mine was empty so I just added that line to it 
and restarted Apache. Now I get Firefox's open or save file window when 
I try to go to a .php file. I just tried the same thing with Midori and 
it works correctly.

So, is this a Firefox problem, and if so what do I fix, where? Or is 
this an Apache/suPHP problem?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <CAJ3mhmjPFR-BLu4WESrxNu3K5N7=CXYaSLJhK=n0P9=im62n3A@mail.gmail.com>

There seem to be a lot of tools for doing screencasting in Linux
including Istanbul, recordMyDesktop, xvidcap, wink,  pyvnc2swf,
byzanz, vnc2swf, ffmpeg, and a few others.  Unlike Camtasia most of
the Linux solutions do not include video/audio editing software in the
package so if you need that you need to move the output of these
packages into openshot, LiVES, keno, or other editing software.

Personally, I use ffmpeg which is a nice simple command line tool.
I generally use commands something like:

 xrandr -s 1280x720
     To reduce my screen resolution.
     My computer just isn't fast enough to capture things are full
resolution without an
     unacceptable lag between the audio and video.  I can avoid this
by reducing my capture
     rate (fps) or by reducing my resolution or by capturing the video
and audio separately and
     resyncing them in openshot or other editing software.  Of these
choices, I find simply
     reducing the screen resolution to be the best compromise for my
particular situation.

sleep 870; xmessage -g -125+60 Time for Intermission
     This sends me a message telling me when to end my video after 14
min 30 sec.

sleep 5; ffmpeg -t 00:14:59 -f oss -i /dev/dsp -f x11grab -s 1280x720
-r 25 -i :0.0 MyVideo.avi
     This creates a 15 minute video (unless I manually end it earlier).

This system seems to work pretty well - although once in a while I
wish I could pause a video
in the middle of it and go back and restart it.  (Of course, I can
effectively do this by cutting and
splicing in my editing software, but I avoid editing as much as
possible because editing is very
slow and time consuming.)

Hope this helps,

David Mandel

D'oh. This happened to me a few years ago. I just had to clear Firefox's 
cache.

In Firefox 3.5 and up click Tools > Clear Recent History

Change the "Time range to clear" to "Everything"

Uncheck all the boxes except Cache

Click on 'Clear Now"

Now Firefox opens index.html and my php scripts work.

I'm at the Hacker's Conference.  I had lunch with Brewster Kahle
yesterday.  I cannot repeat what is said at the conference on 
this list, but interesting stuff is happening.  If some of you
want to help do some hard work for better library public access,
lets talk after a PLUG meeting.

Right now, Brad Templeton of EFF is telling us cool things about
last year's many legal battles.  Let's hope we can find a solution
before we ask their lawyers for help.

In a former lifetime, yes.  But now with Boyer-Moore and other

Fedora 14, x86_64.

Having a frustrating time trying to find where the buttons are for
configuring appearance options. For seasoned KDE users, here are a
few dumb questions:

1) There is a quarter circle in the upper right corner of the screen
that says it is a Tool Box. How do I get rid of it?

2) The panel is solid medium gray with black fonts. How can I change
the color of the panel so I can read the text?

3) How can I move the panel from the bottom of the screen to the top of
the screen?

4) Is there a widget that I can add to the panel to allow me to change
network configurations, like finding wifi access points and connecting
to them?

K-Menu -> System Settings -> Style -> Work Space; Choose over all theme here Oxygen on my system gives white/black panel
K-Menu -> System Settings -> Style -> Colors; More mucking about options.

Click in blank area of panel.  It will then expand.  in center of expanded panel will
be "Screen Edge" click and hold there, drag panel to desired screen edge.

You may need to unlock panel first ... option is available from same expanded panel view IIRC.

Yes, normally installed by default.  In any case. 
Click in blank area of panel, when it expands choose "Add Widgets" and choose from there.

That helped. The Oxygen theme gives me a black panel with white text so
now at least I can read it. But the panel is black with white text and
I want it reversed. I've tried lots of choices in System Settings >

I don't know why it was not installed by default. And it's still not
available, that is, when I right click on the panel and choose Add
Widgets, there is no network widget listed. There is a button to get
additional widgets that I haven't tried yet. I can't believe that I
have to go get additional widgets in order to have a button to select
wireless access points. 

Anyone who thinks any of these desktop environments is intuitive has
never met up with my version of intuition.

It was not clear to me from the article if the new shell options will
be available to all users of Gnome 3, or just users of Gnome 3 on Mint

I've been installing widgets and adding them to the panel. So far every
one has resulted in the following error message:

	Unable to load the widget. Could not create a python

No point in trying any more widgets until I figure out what is wrong. I
know I have Python installed (or some version of it) because Scribus
scripts require Python and the scripts all work.

One would hope they would open source these additions and make them
available upstream (at least to Ubuntu, if not any GNOME using distro).

It sounds like a good idea to me.  I didn't see mention of it, but would
hope there are also options to add back in some more control options, GNOME
3 control panel looks desolate compared to GNOME 2.  I agree with the main
point of simplifying things for new users, but at the expense of power
users being able to tweak things (power users which still make up a large
percentage of Linux users) I disagree with.  A setting somewhere that says
"I know what I'm doing, give me options dagnabbit" would have been welcome.

My point of view comes from using mostly Fedora 15, and some Ubuntu 11.x
and Linux Mint 11.

Have you tried the gnome-tweak-tools program?

Usually there are more options under the hood that you can toggle with
the gconf/dconf editor.

For mailing lists:
* Mailman (or some other suitable MLM) and everything that goes along
with that--MTA, spam/AV-scanning, etc.
* Archives are currently only about 1.4GiB

For web site:
* Current site is running in a local build of Apache 1.3, for mod_perl &
HTML::Mason; there is a Python MoinMoin wiki up too. There are some
plans for re-doing the site; I am not sure what the intention is.
* Shell access for a handful of people to do edits. (They might be
amenable to something like source-control repo with an automatic
check-out.)

For DNS:
* Authoritative name server and some sort of secondary.

There are other no-cost hosting options that are potentially viable,
depending on the technologies that are desired for the future.

For example, lists/forums could be done with Nabble and a wiki could be
done with Wikia and any one of several blog services could be used for
on-going announcements and such. I've recently discovered that gandi.net
includes DNS hosting as part of their standard $15/yr registration
package, so it's conceivable that the whole thing could be outsourced to
various SaaS providers.

I am using Fedora 14 on my laptop and have held off upgrading to Fedora
15 just because I really dislike the appearance of Gnome 3. In fact, at
the moment I am trying to move to KDE (cf. my questions in another
thread). If I can just figure out how to tweak a few more things I
might just stick with KDE. 

It used to be that Gnome was simple and uncluttered and KDE looked like
a circus. Now it seems that things have reversed themselves.

I agree free SaaS services are a more modern approach to the problem.
The odd item out seems to be the mod_perl/HTML::Mason item, though
Amazon does offer the minimal "free" tier.

I can offer some time to help migrate to those solutions, if
they meets the needs of the group.

Ubuntu Oregon can likely host the PLUG Mailing List and Web. We have a
sponsorship ongoing for all our our web infrastructure and I don't see this
being a issue.

I solved the above problem by going into Yumex, searching on "KDE," and
installing a couple dozen packages, including several that included
"python" in the name.

It has taken me all day, but I finally have a KDE desktop that is
usable. There are still a few tweaks needed, but I can get to them in
good time. 

Now I can upgrade to Fedora 16 and ditch Gnome.

I realize I'm just a luddite, but I really, really dislike modern 
'desktops'.  I think KDE hit its peak of actual usability around version 
3.5 or so....

You are invited to a free IEEE talk at 6 pm Tuesday November 15:

"Technology Futures: A Rapidly Changing Landscape"
Speaker: Steve Brown, Chief Evangelist, Intel Corporation

Integra Telecom is paying for the pizza, but asking for RSVPs.
https://meetings.vtools.ieee.org/meeting_view/list_meeting/8679

The venue is Tektronix building 38, a 5 minute walk from the 
Millikan Way MAX station out here in the suburban wasteland.

Sadly, there will be No Beer, and the nearest semi-decent tavern
is the McMenamins at Cedar Hills Boulevard and Jenkins ( a 15
minute walk! ).  Perhaps we can ferry people about with
automobiles, as we are wont to do here in the burbs. 

You can bike to and from the Max without crossing busy streets,
though getting a bicycle on the rush hour Max might be a challenge.

I was told that somewhere in my office application, probably as a part of

sheets and common sizes of labels.  I can't find them.  Please help.

Debra,

   LibreOffice-3? Same as in OO.o. Try File -> New -> From templates -> My
templates (an ugly Microsoftism). If there's no one home there, Do File ->
New -> Labels and create your own from the pick list at the bottom right of
the dialog box.

Message-ID: <19cba4100a863c85058c369ec505f9ee.squirrel@mail.web-ster.com>

I just upgraded my laptop to Ubuntu 11.10, and whenever I close the lid
the backlight goes off.

That would be a good thing, except that when I open the lid the backlight
does not come on.  This is new with Ubuntu 11.10.

I've found some web pages that relate similar symptoms with Linux and
various other laptops, but the diagnosed root causes seem to be all over
the map, and none of the suggested work-arounds seem to work around the
problem for me, except for setting 'nomodeset' in grub which messes up my
screen aspect ratio.

Anyone have any suggestions?

That is "hibernate", isn't it?  ... close the lid and the box goes into 
hibernate mode until opened again?  Sometimes there is a hibernate 
button as well ... sometimes called sleep?
Well, I am not going to be much help ... sorry ... when I had laptops 
(Red Hat or Mandriva/Mandrake), hibernate never worked for me either.  I 
should be interested to hear (and to hear how) if anyone has ever gotten 
that to work in Linux.
At one time Red Hat had a laptop specific install ... hibernate may have 
worked in that, but I didn't have a laptop at that point, and the laptop 
install (as I remember) would not had suited my needs anyway.  I think 
Mandrake once supported laptop install as well.
Sorry

It works fine on my Acer Aspire running Ubuntu 10.04. I have to push the 
power button, but it responds to it as if it were a toggle on a sleep 
button. It comes back up to faster than the same machine running XP, 
too. (No surprise there.)

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu UEFI install
Message-ID: <4EC056F0.4000504@seitzassoc.com>

FYI regarding UEFI and Ubuntu:

If you want to use UEFI to boot Ubuntu, you need to be sure that you
boot the Ubuntu installer using UEFI.  I have an Intel motherboard
(DB65AL) with UEFI enabled.  When you enter the boot menu(F10) with
the Ubuntu install disk in the optical drive, the boot menu has both
legacy BIOS and UEFI boot entries for the install disk.  If you choose
the legacy BIOS entry, the installer will not allow you to set up an
EFI boot partition.  You must choose the UEFI entry when booting.
Perhaps this should have been obvious, but I wasted several hours
before it finally dawned on me what was happening.  Booting either
entry brings up the installer, so the difference is not immediately
apparent.  Only when you bring up the manual partition tool is the
difference seen.  With a UEFI boot, the partition tool has a 'Use as:'
option of 'EFI boot partition'.  A legacy BIOS boot will not display
this option.  I suspect that the choice of legacy BIOS boot or UEFI
boot also determines whether a DOS or GPT partition table is created,
but I haven't confirmed this.

Note that the above experience is actually with mythbuntu 11.10, but
presumably the other Ubuntu install disks would behave similarly.

BTW, an advanced topics talk on UEFI would be useful.

I searched the guides, where I found similar problems with other lap
tops and older distros (that's where the idea to use "nomodeset" came
from, as well as some acpi flags that didn't help).  But nothing
specific to this one.

Subject: [PLUG] XFCE disappeared!
Message-ID: <20111114155145.5e2716c1@mailhost.pdx.edu>

In anticipation of upgrading my Fedora 14 laptop to Fedora 16 I decided
to switch from Gnome. I spent a long time trying to get KDE to work
properly, but eventually gave up and moved on to XFCE. After several
hours of tweaking and fixing it the way I wanted it I decided to log
out and back in again. And when the login screen came up my only
choices were Gnome and KDE. XFCE is gone, disappeared into the ether,
like a soft vapor on a summer day. OK, it's a chilly rainy fall day,
but it's still gone.

I searched in Yum Extender on "xfce" and reinstalled everything, but no
joy. 

I suspect it's just an entry in some login settings file, but I don't
know where to look or why it disappeared. I hope there is someone out in
PLUG-land who understands how login screens work, because I need some
clues.

John,

   Look in ~/.xinitrc (or equivalent) and see if it has a line at the bottom
to set the window manager. If so, modify that line to point to startxfce4.

I think you hit the problem, although not quite squarely on the head.

During my tweaking of XFCE I discovered that the Compose key that I had
set to the left Windows key in Gnome was not working. I asked on the
XFCE forums and a kind fellow said to use:

setxkbmap -option compose:lwin

I did so and it worked. Then I asked how to make it permanent and he
said to put the command into .xinitrc. I replied that I did not have
such a file and asked if I should just create it. He responded that it
would be fine to do so, so I made the file and put the command in it.
It was after doing this that I logged out and discovered that XFCE was
no longer a login option.

So just now I renamed the .xinitrc file to .xinitrc_old, logged out and
logged back in again. But I still don't have an XFCE login option. 

I still bet the .xinitrc file is the source of the problem, but it must
have done something else as well. Or maybe I need to add a line
pointing to startxfce4. But I want the login screen to give me all
three DE options that I have installed - Gnome, KDE and XFCE. 

Also, where is startxfce4? How do I point to it?

Check that you have the "xfce4-session" rpm installed.  I believe that
that RPM contains the files needed to get it to show up as a login
option.

   'locate startxfce4' will tell you that.

   You should have ~/.xfce4 with xinitrc (among other files and directories).
In there you should see the command to run xfce4-session.

   I don't use GDM or KDM so I can't help you set either up to allow you to
choose the desktop environment you want. I log in to a console then use
'startx' as an alias to startxfce4 (which is in /usr/bin/ on Slackware).

HTH,

Rich

There are two such RPMs. They were installed, and reinstalled, and I
just reinstalled them again. Still no joy.

This is not the /right/ way to solve your problem, but it should work:

You can create a  custom xsession configuration pretty easily -- I had
this problem recently with Fedora 15 (I wanted to use xmonad as my
WM), and blogged briefly about it so I could find the solution again:

http://creswick.github.com/blog/2011/11/07/xmonad-in-fedora-15/

You'll want it to point to the xsession executable instead of xmonad,
so something like this may work:

/usr/share/xsessions/xfce4.desktop:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=XFCE4
Comment=Window manager
Exec=/usr/bin/startxfce4
Type=Application

Once that's created (as root) you'll need to log out, but that should be it.

This was part of the solution. I checked and, sure enough,
in /usr/share/xsession there were desktop files for Gnome, KDE, and KDE
safe mode, but none for XFCE. 

But then I checked and there was no startxfce4 script anywhere in the
filesystem either. So, while scratching my head, I refreshed the page in
the XFCE forums where I had posted about this problem earlier today, and
there was a reply. The reply said that I needed to check in Fedora
forums because it was a problem with a package not installing the
desktop file. He specifically stated that on his OpenSUSE computer he
needed to install xfce-utils. So I fired up Yumex and, sure enough,
xfce-utils was not installed it. I installed it, and afterwards not
only was the script in place, but the desktop file had been created
in /etc/share/xsession. I logged out and back in again, chose XFCE, and
here I am in XFCE-land again.

Now, the big question is, why was the login option there previously when
xfce-utils was never installed? I am guessing that because I originally
installed XFCE a couple years ago, at that time the xfce-utils package
was not required. But that doesn't explain why the script and desktop
file would disappear. 

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!

Folks, 

I'm just starting to notice the "how to save Fedora" thread on the
associated users list. The number of messages on the subject is pretty
intense. I had thought it was flame bait until seeing the attention
given by notable Fedora developers such as Alan Cox and Thomas Cameron,
including this bit:

"It's bloated
It picks bad user defaults
It ships a default desktop which burns CPU horribly"

ref
http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/users/2011-November/407525.html 

While I don't think there's --any-- risk that Red Hat stops Fedora, I do
wonder if Fedora is about to go through some significant changes.

Thanks,
Mike

I've been sitting in front of a Fedora laptop for several hours a day
for the past couple of years. Prior to that I used Ubuntu, starting
with the (then) current Breezy. Throughout this time I read the Ubuntu
and Fedora forums daily, often participating by asking questions or
answering when I could.

I can summarize for you in one word the reason for the current flurry
of venom: Gnome 3. OK, that was two words. But one was a number, and we
all know that numbers don't count.

Gnome developers have never made it a secret that they view Gnome as a
full-featured desktop environment for current hardware. They make no
bones about the fact that Gnome 3 requires significant computing power
and is not intended for legacy hardware. 

At the same time RedHat has been fully open about the purpose of the
Fedora project: To be a test ground for cutting edge stuff that will
eventually make it into RedHat after the Fedora users get the kinks
out. 

When you combine those two philosophies you get frustrated users. I
knew that Fedora 15 introduced Gnome 3 (without a fully implemented
fallback or legacy mode), and I deliberately held off on upgrading my
Fedora 14 laptop. Unfortunately, because of RedHat's purpose for
Fedora I must upgrade or be cut off from software updates. That is,
Fedora supports only the current version and one version back. I am
currently in the throes of moving from Gnome to XFCE so that if, as I
suspect will be the case, I really can't stand Gnome 3 I will have an
alternative in place. (And so far I am actually liking XFCE, now that I
have spent a considerable time getting it configured - I may never go
back to Gnome.)

Now factor in human nature. We are all creatures of habit. In my new
XFCE desktop I have a wide panel on the left edge of the screen, wide
because I wanted a text clock at the top of it. But for years with
Gnome on Ubuntu and Fedora the clock was at the top right. My eyes
still automatically go to the top right to check the time. I will get
used to it, but many people are not willing to retrain themselves. And
even I have my limits. I will not tolerate Gnome 3's massive clutter of
icons all over the screen. 

When I read the complaints about Gnome 3 on the Fedora forums I am
struck that the vast majority are whiners who do not wish to change.
There are a number, however, who have legitimate complaints about
missing functionality and inability to customize the appearance. And I
do sympathize with the whiners to some extent; Gnome 3 was a very large
leap all at once. 

In the end it will all sort itself out. Gnome will add extensions to
restore missing functionality and appearance, and users will get used
to the new Gnome. And some of us will move on to something else. I
might be a bit worried about Gnome, but I wouldn't lose any sleep over
Fedora.

   I've still not found why urxvt/rxvt-unicode (and now plain rxvt) will not

see only the right end of the line. Quite frustrating since I seem to be the
only person in the world with this issue. Anywho, ...

   I see that setterm has an option, -linewrap on, that is supposed to fix
the problem, but appears not to do so. That's probably because I'm not
correctly applying it. There should also be a way within terminfo to turn on
line wrapping, but I don't know how to edit that, or how to modify termcap.

   Suggestions and ideas welcome.

All excellent points, although ...

In recent years, Red Hat has focused on the server market, and
R.H. Enterprise Linux is designed to provide a stable platform to
run business critical applications, mostly outwards-facing web stuff.
I use Scientific Linux, which is like RHEL except that Fermilabs
supports older versions longer (otherwise I would pay $$ for RHEL).  

So - I can imagine Red Hat taking another run at the desktop, with
a Red Hat Desktop product (Gnome 3) and a Red Hat Enterprise product
(Gnome 2 or "Gnome 3--").  They would be crazy to slow down core
server function to put dancing paperclips on screen, or to require
their legacy customers to learn a new interface to keep getting
support.  I imagine the result of "Enterprise Gnome 3" would be a
mass exodus to CentOS and S.L., with a distro fork and perhaps new
upstream vendors appearing out of that.  Red Hat is not that dumb.

Gnome 3 will eventually be great for individual desktop machines, and
it will be the death of Windows As We Know It.  It may even become the
core of "Windows 9".  Eventually Micro$oft, currently on the stock
market downwards track to be the world's 6th largest computer company,
will no longer have the resources to patch their bloatware O.S..

I am setting up a computer for some folks I only see every four years.  I

I was thinking Ubuntu they have a version  that they maintain for four, ?,
years.

And other suggestions?

Nope only two. 

Basic Debian with something to do security patching automagically would be worthy of consideration.

What?  Really?

Yes! Really! https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS

New policy from Ubuntu extending LTS for five years on both desktop and server versions.
Mistake in my last reply: they release a new LTS every two years, but desktop was supported for three.

   Slackware has been around a very long time, and folks are still running
several distributions back. All need to be patched periodically, and
Slackwate patches go back to release 11.x or 12.x while the current version
is 13.37.

This is what I've done in the past. My parents had a Debian box I had
set up in roughly 2001 that lasted until my father passed in 2007. Of
course all they used it for was typing documents (they didn't even use
it for email or browsing much). I think they may have used Abiword the
entire time too.

That being said, Ubuntu LTS with auto-update is pretty straight
forward if you're installing it for people who you wont see for a
while yet are more computer savvy than my parents were. And I wouldn't
say it'd get too far out of date for most people- hell, many people
still run XP without a complaint in the world.

You *could* also go the Live CD route. SLAX, Knoppix, etc and so on.

ok everyone bust out your longest-running-linux story--this might get
hilarious =)

I'm still running ubuntu 6.06 (june 06) which just became unsupported
a few months ago, at a colo i can't get to until xmas.  it's been
rock-solid for 5 years now.

i just found out that a fileserver/firewall i set up for my dad's
office in late 2001 is still working fine.  i assumed it had crashed
and burned long ago, but apparently not.  it's running suse 7.3 and
has not been updated since i installed it.  by design, there are no
external services running on it.  i'm kind of surprised the hardware
(rescued from being thrown away at the time--probably a 2-300mhz CPU)
still lives & breathes, considering it's lived in a cabinet for the
last 10 years.  i am kind of afraid to touch it because it will
probably just crumble.  maybe i'll just go look at it
hopefully/encouragingly next time i'm at his office.

i somewhat recently got rid of a lot of sun & sgi hardware and even a
sony NEWS machine that all had 10-20 (sony - at least 20) year old
OS's and still ran, though they hadn't served heavy duty in the past
10+ years on my watch and were pretty much just toys (unlike the linux
boxes above that have been constantly powered on and in use).

Well, if we're just talking general longest-running-linux and not
something specifically made for friends and family, my web-servers
were installed in 1997(ish) and haven't been re-installed since. Only
upgrades. Been running Debian Testing the entire time. (And only had
two catastrophic upgrades, both times recoverable without
re-installing or restoring from backup- One involved the switch to
Apache 2.0, the other was when that SSH bug was found in
Debian-derived distros).

The hosting company I go through doesn't even offer the ability to
custom choose your distro release any more (they now just offer CentOS
and Ubuntu), that's how long ago it was :-)

My record for uptime is on a Debian box was over 980 days. That's a long
time to go without a reboot (and I probably needed a few kernel updates by
then). I was in the process of migrating web sties from that server to a
new server when the UPS's battery failed and my co-workers unplugged the
thing in a panic. It was still getting power, but the low-battery warning
was beeping. At that point all I wanted was to get to 1000 days uptime and
they dashed my hopes with the yank of a power cord...

BTW: I'm starting to use Inkscape, and it's looking to be reasonable.  I
find it frustrating that Inkscape doesn't let me specify everything from
the keyboard (circles and squares, yes -- nodes on a line, no.  Grr),
but at least I can get things sort of where I want using "snap to
grid" (and I suppose I could always try editing the XML by hand, sure
thing).

It's not hibernate -- this is just turning the backlight off, but the
computer is still running in the background.  I've _never_ gotten either
suspend or hibernate to work on that machine.

Subject: [PLUG] Desperate! Fedora 16 upgrade killed X
Message-ID: <20111116175928.0ea8f4f4.johnxj@comcast.net>

I had Fedora 14 x86_64 working fine on my Thinkpad T61. Last night I made a full backup and today I upgraded to Fedora 16. The upgrade proceeded withoui error. I can boot into Recovery Mode (gives me terminal as root), but I can't get X to come up.

Probably unrelated but, while at the command line as root, I have no network. I did "ifconfig eth0 up" and then I could see eth0 in the list of interfaces, but I still cannot go anywhere. I can't even ping my printers. I need to fix that as well, else I won't be able to install anything. 

The error message (echoed in /var/log/Xorg.o.log) is:

	Fatal server error: no screens found.

I was using the nVidia driver, so I renamed /etc/X11/xorg.conf, but I got the same error when it tried to use the nouveau driver.

At the moment it is booted to the Fedora 16 Live CD, and running fine at 1680x1050. Therefore, it is not Fedora 16 per se, but rather something in the upgrade that got messed up.

I need suggestions badly!

John,

   Back up xorg.conf to a different name (I made mine /etc/X11/XXxorg.conf)
and log out and back in. The newer versions of xorg don't play well with the
conf file.

I already did that. Same error. It can't find screens using the nouveau driver or the vesa driver either. 

I should have mentioned, the video is nVdia Quadro NVS 140M. 

I found a suggestion on the net to add "nvidia.modeset=0 to the end of the boot line in Grub. Tried it, didn't make any difference. But I might not have put it in the right place because Grub is the new one and doesn't havea "boot" line, at least not opne that is recognizable.

I need to get the networking up so I can reinstall things.

OK, ifconfig shows only lo, but after I do ifconfig eth0 up and ifconfig wlan0 up the ifconfig command shows them both. However, neither has an IP address. (There are both ethernet and wireless  availabe to the computer.)

Lspci shows both devices. And I was booted to a Fedora 16 live CD and it had no problem with networking. So we know the hardware is fine. Lsmod shows iwl4965, but nothing that I can identify as the module for ethernet. "modprobe iwl4965" executes without error, but does nothing. Then again, maybe the wireless device really is available now and I just need to do something to get it connected to the WRT54G. There are commands to find and connect to access points, but I can't remember them.

Possibly an undereducated long shot but ...

Do you get your IP addresses from your router or do you assign static IP 
addresses? If the former, is there a DHCP client running? (I think 
that's the right end of the stick.) If not, then wouldn't that mean your 
system never asks for an IP address?

Does your system have an on board video device that could be used if the 
nVidia card was pulled? Just a trouble shooting idea to see if it will 
work. If it does than you can keep trying to figure out what's 
preventing the nVidia driver from working.

I finally managed to get the netwrok running, at least via the
wireless. 

Fedora 16 now offers a Grub boot menu like Ubuntu, i.e., there is the
regular boot option and underneath is a Recovery Mode option. When I
didn't get X up with the regular boot option I rebooted and chose
Recovery Mode. That got me to a command line as root. And that is where
I discovered that the network was not working. 

It took quite a learning curve, but I got it connected to the wireless.
To do so I had to learn about wpa_supplicant and I had to create a psk
key. Luckily wpa_supplicant was installed - because I couldn't install
anything without the connection. I also had to delve into forgotten
parts of iwconfig and iwlist, reading lots of man pages and web sites.

And then I discovered that if I let it boot to the GUI, even though X
wouldn't start, I could do Ctrl-Alt-F2 to get to a console, and having
done so the ethernet was working. Why it wasn't working when I booted
to Recovery Mode I do not know. But at least now I have the net.

I still can't get X to come up. The weird error messages I am getting
(and still googling on) are:

	Refusing to touch device with a bound kernel driver
	(EE) open /dev/fb0: No such device
	(EE) Screens found, but none have a usable configuration

It won't come up with vesa, nouveau, or nvidia. All three give the same
error messages as above. That tells me that something fundamental is
wrong, 'cause vesa will run on cardboard and spit. I did discover that
Fedora 16 after the upgrade was not running the right proprietary
nVidia driver, even though it was in the repos. I updated it, but X
still won't come up.

It's late. I'm going to bed. In the morning after coffee I'll have a
much better chance of figuring out what is wrong.

Okay, I'll tell what I have, though it doesn't come close to some long
running Linux systems that have already been mentioned in this thread.

I have a box with an old MSI mobo, a 1.5GHz Athlon chip and 512MB RAM,
plus a SCSI controller, a couple of old 10K RPM 10GB Quantum SCSI hard
drives and a floppy drive. All but the case, PSU, RAM, Ethernet cards,
CD-ROM drive, keyboard and mouse were picked up at Free Geek for about
$50 total, and the 15" CRT monitor was a salvaged 'gift' from a friend.

Not counting what I spent to build the box initially over 12 years ago
before the original system imploded due to CPU fan failure, I probably
spent less than $200 to rebuild this machine for a firewall and backup.

The system is a rock solid firewall running iptables that I've
written, and I've never been hacked, although I see lots of attempts
in my logs.

It's running Mandriva 2008.1 which is no longer supported, and KDE
3.5. It stays powered on 24/7/365, and is only rebooted after the
occasional power outage. I have used it as a backup desktop system
when my desktop box had hardware problems, but mostly it's a firewall,
print server and an internet radio server for streaming m3u playlists
at Paradise Radio.

It also backs up all of my personal data files once every week, just
in case I ever lose the three backups I keep on my desktop system plus
the backup on my laptop. All three systems are linked by rsync
backups, and those two non-desktop systems rsync their cron job logs
to the desktop.

Yes, I am a bit paranoid about backups. Having a CPU fan fail
silently, taking out a motherboard, PSU and a couple of hard drives
will do that.

I'll probably install the latest Mandriva, or maybe Mageia, on that
box one of these days, but I'm not in a hurry to do that. It's running
fine now for what I need it to do.

Anyway, that is my oldest Linux operating system that is still
kicking. I enjoy hearing about other people's Linux systems, so please
do share.

All the best,
Robert

My oldest system is:
morbo:/home/dcf# uname -a
FreeBSD morbo.sourballs.org 5.3-RELEASE-p22 FreeBSD 5.3-RELEASE-p22 #0: 
Sun Sep 25 11:49:20 CDT 2005

but what impresses me more is that the hardware is an ancient HP Pavilion 
bought in 1996.

   My Dell laptop has an issue with the Intel video chip and the driver; I
forget the exact details. However, adding the line, 'append=nomodeset', to
the global portion (at the top) of /etc/lilo.conf fixed the problem. Give
this a try. Remember to run /sbin/lilo after making any change to the
configuration file.

Subject: [PLUG] Firefox Cookie Management
Message-ID: <4EC54B70.7070101@comcast.net>

An article in yesterday's USA Today (USA Yesterday?) described tracking 
done by various web sites using cookies. It focused on Facebook in 
particular and talked about the various ways Facebook tracks visitors to 
a Facebook site. My understanding is that this is only possible through 
the use of cookies -- at least for those not logged in to Facebook.

So, if I visited a Facebook page I'm supposed to have been given a 
cookie that will in some way track my web travels. I think it's 
something to do with whether or not the pages I visit have a Facebook 
connection on them, but I don't really know those details.

What I'd like to know is how I can inspect individual cookies to 
determine where they came from. It appears that I can "manage" my 
Firefox cookies by clicking on Tools > Clear Recent History ... . I have 
only a few options. I can choose the time frame to clear, and I can 
choose the category of thing to clear, cookies being one of the categories.

I don't want to clear all the cookies. I want to look at the collection, 
which now appears to be kept with sql-lite.

Does anyone know of a tool that let's me inspect the cookie collection 
and decide what to keep and what to get rid of?

Thanks.

I was always of the impression that cookies are basically just text
files. For many of them the filename is also a giveaway.

You can also tell Firefox not to accept cookies from specific sites. I
banned Amazon and Google, although the latter has figured out ways
around it so they still insist on serving me data that they think will
make my internet experience more useful.

Thanks. You're right. Decipher-ability is indeed vague. Some of them are 
fairly clear as to who they belong to. Others are less so. I did see 
that there were quite a few with the cookie name of __utmz or __utma. So 
I Googled those and found that they are Google cookies related to their 
AdSense program, recording the site I came from (__utmz) and how many 
times I've been to the current site (__utma).

Looks like I'll be devoting some more time to figuring out how I want to 
manage my cookies, or maybe toss them.

That's what I used to think, too. Seems like plain text files are no 
longer the way Firefox does it. I suppose it makes sense since it's 
probably more efficient to use a database.

I'll have to put some time into thinking about this one.

If you prefer not to be tracked and have all your web browsing sliced,
diced and analyzed to a fare-thee-freakin-well by every marketeer and
gawd knows who else on the planet, the safest thing to do is allow as
few cookies as possible, and even restrict many to be session cookies.

You can do this in Firefox at Edit > Preferences > Privacy, simply by
unchecking the box 'Accept cookies from sites' and setting up explicit
permissions with the Exceptions button, which opens a list of cookies.

Go through the list and delete all cookies for websites that you don't
recognize as places such as forums where you've registered an account.

Those websites for which you want to keep your userids between visits,
you should Allow, and other websites that you want to access that need
you to allow cookies will usually be satisfied by 'Allow for Session'.

You should also click the checkbox 'Tell websites I do not want to be
tracked', plus 'Clear history when Firefox closes', to foil Facecrack.

You might be surprised at how few cookies you actually need to permit.

Regards,
Robert

True enough (that's generally my approach), though you'll likely also 
spend time managing cookie permissions and trying to figure out why 
sites mysteriously seem "broken". At least that's my experience. Many 
sites seem to assume that you've enabled cookies and don't bother to 
test and warn the user that cookies are required for feature X or form Y 
to function properly.

My workstation is running etch and has been up for over a year since the 
last time it was shutdown for a hardware update (and I think it might 
have been a year since the shutdown before that.)  Not very funny 
really, especially when I think about "upgrading" to KDE 4.

There is also Ghostery. http://www.ghostery.com   This gets at the

Guess what?! You probably don't have power management either.

Back in the Good Old Days of Linux there was a 6-12 month window when
power management and wireless worked through the standard Linux
start-up scripts and other headless mechanisms (eg: actual ACPI
scripts that ran on evens such as the lid switch).  For reasons
unbeknownst to me, that configuration logic was moved into GUI apps
such as NM-Applet and the gnome-power-manager; which won't run without
an Xserver.  In some sense, it's logical for the configuration of
those aspects to be a per-user decision, so running them /after/ login
makes some sense -- however, that leaves you with a system that can't
connect to the network or sleep unless you have a graphical login.

I believe that Fedora has integrated at least the nm-applet (or
something similar) into the new X greeter (the graphical login) so
that may be getting far enough, in your case, to start up the network
manager before it crashes, or fails to display.

In short: you can't expect to have networking or power management
unless you have X running, or you configured it yourself.

I'm sorry, but I have to call FUD here. The reason John didn't have
wireless *configured* in his recovery session is because it was.... a
recovery session. You'll note he said that he had his wireless
configured when using a VT on the main system where X is crashing.

I don't know the specifics of Fedora's recovery mode but the general
idea is to boot in as minimal environment as possible and let people
try and fix things the old fashioned way. I wouldn't be surprised if
it's not actually booting the main OS but instead was some initrd like
image.

NetworkManager is (nowadays at least) a daemon with separate GUI and
CLI configuration utilities, it doesn't matter if you have X or not.

Joshua

Message-ID: <1321567773.1731.19.camel@servo>

It was suggested that I contact System 76 about my backlight problem on
my old Gazelle laptop.  I figured that they'd just blow me off, or send
me a polite "we don't support that anymore, BOZO".

But no -- I got a polite response with some suggestions showing some
genuine concern.  They didn't _work_, but clearly those guys _care_, and
this for a laptop that's been out of warranty for far longer than it's
been in existence.

I've had good support experiences with these guys in the past, too, and
the laptop is about 65 in Laptop Years (I've owned it for more than
seven years, it's gotten knocked around quite a bit, pieces are falling
off the case, etc., -- and it still works just fine).

So if you want a decent machine that's known to work with Linux, and
you're too lazy to build one -- you could do a lot worse than going
through System 76.

Just how long before the laptop came into existence did the warranty 
expire? :-)

Ah, I wasn't thinking about the recovery session, and I'll admit that
my network-less experiences have been with Ubuntu and Debian, and also
with wifi.  It's not clear from the OP's description of problems
whether the working internet is wired or not, since both have featured
in this thread.  I would be surprised if fedora is able to connect to
an WAP that was configured via a user-space GUI prior to anyone
logging in.

Power management is another thing entirely -- I've had continual
problems with suspend/resume on Fedora 15, Debian and Ubuntu for the
last 2-3 years.  I can't recall a recent distro that would properly
suspend/resume before someone logged in.

Perhaps you've had better luck,  I still worry about snapping a laptop
shut and putting it straight into a bag w/out confirming that it is
actually turning off.

I recommend the KDE4 version of Linux Mint.  I've been using KDE Linux Mint
for about 4 years now, & it's very easy to use, just keeps working.  Adobe
Flash, & all of the codecs you need are ready to go without needing to
install them or tinker at all.  Also, Mint does offer some LTS releases.

There's a reason Mint has beat out Ubuntu & is at the very top of
Distrowatch's page hit rankings.

KDE Mint 9 is LTS:  http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=1495

Actually, at home I am wired, although I also have a WRT-54G that I
installed mostly for the phone. But the laptop can connect to it also,
and I did so last night when I was in recovery mode without a working
wired connection. Connecting to a wireless network from the command
line is a challenge. But it was not all wasted effort, as I gained some
education about wpa_supplicant, albeit at the expense of frustration.

This morning I worked on the X server not coming up but was unable to
get it working. I had to spend the whole afternoon at PSU, but I'm home
now to work on it for the rest of the evening. If I can't get it
working by mid-morning tomorrow I plan to go to Best Buy and get a
Seagate Momentus Hybrid. Then I'll go distro shopping and reinstall
something from scratch. I'm thinking hard about Mint. For sure it won't
be Fedora. 

Stay tuned this evening for grumbles, and hopefully eventually a cheer
of joy.

I couldn't find where it said Mint 9 is LTS:

Check out Ghostery (http://www.ghostery.com). I have been trying it out on a Mac (Safari), but it is available for firefox, along with the other usual suspects. I have found this little tool very interesting and informative. It doesn't deal specifically with cookies, but  could provide helpful information on cookies that are set.

Either way, I have found this a neat little add-on.

Hope this helps

NetworkManager lets you configure connections as "system-wide" rather than per-user. It may even be the default, I don't recall.

Can't disagree here. I've had a colleague kill a battery in a Lenovo laptop as it was in his bag "suspended".

to be fair, this happens even on my brand new macbook pro.  it loses
approx 20% life between 5pm sleep and 9am wake.  at least my netbook
(which has far more battery life) makes it a over a week suspended on
a full battery.  not much over, though...

There are different ways to count the popularity of a distro, and the
way distrowatch does it is not the most accurate. Still, Mint seems to

So which will be the next LTS version?

Hurray!

After reading /var/log/messages I realized that I had a passel of
incompatible video drivers, both proprietary and open source. So I used
yum from the command line to find and erase them all. Then I rebooted
and X finally came up.

It's a mess because the upgrade to Fedora 16 caused a lot of
application icnompatibilities, but I'll work on that later. At least I
have my computer back!

Thanks to all for your patience in listening to my moans and complaints.

> Mint doesn't seem to advertise which releases are LTS.  Why, I don't
know.  You can tell by what release of Kubuntu it's based on.  KDE Mint 9
is based on Kubuntu 10.04, so they're both LTS.  The KDE Mint that comes
out a few months after Kubuntu 12.04 will also be LTS, as it's based on
Kubuntu 12.04.  It would be nice if Mint were to start advertising that
fact from now on.

Message-ID: <20111118170854.GB12644@gate.kl-ic.com>

I regret to inform you of my appearance at Linux Clinic,
1 PM Sunday Nov 20 at Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Ave in Portland,
3 blocks south of Hawthorne.  I will be joined by our fearless
leader John Jordan, and many of the Usual Suspects.

We will have mice, keyboards, monitors, internet, distros,
and confusion about Linux, which we would be glad to share
with you.  You can bring your Linux problems, and have a
hearty laugh while we try to solve them.

If someone brings a washtub and some old disks, we can play
the marvelous new Thai party game, "bobbing for hard drives". 
I am not allowed to play the game in Thailand anymore.  I
left the water running in the bathtub when I departed Bangkok,
and that seems to have caused problems.

So bring your Windows hard drives, and the computer around them,
and we will dunk 'em or reformat 'em with Linux, your choice.  

Keith

   I inadvertently changed permissions on all directories and files in my ~/
to 755 (including the dot files, of course). Only the directories should
have those perms; regular files should be 644.

   I want to correct this as quickly as possible, but I cannot find an option
in the chmod man page that will ignore directories while changing all other
files. There's probably a scripting approach using file and exec, but I've
not done anything like this before so guidance on how to restore the
appropriate perms will be very helpful.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1111181139280.6239@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've pretty well isolated the line wrapping issue I've been suffering to
something in my login shells. When I su to a root login shell, long lines
wrap as they did before, but when I open a terminal as me the user, it
doesn't.

   Also, the command 'ls | less' no longer works properly. It displays ANSI
escape sequences at line beginings and end; for example,

ESC[00mOpenVZ-Users-Guide.pdfESC[0m
ESC[00mPEHJ0073-02.pdfESC[0m

   In my ignorance, I suspect these two issues are related. I commented out
.inputrc in .bash_profile, but am out of ideas how to isolate what I broke
that brought on this behavior.

   Please provide suggestions, advice, or solutions.

I've been using Mint since version 5 and it has been very solid, even on 
old hardware (PIII 600, PIII 733, original P4).

All Mint releases and when their support ends as well as which versions 
are LTS can be found here:

Which distro has the best staying power?  I'm guessing the ones who are
Debian or debian based or red hat or redhat based or slackware or slackware
based or gentoo or arch, or possibly LFS.

I've run into this before... sorry, I don't have the exact incantation at
my disposal (from notes, nor from memory)... but I do remember that I used
xargs and a pipe along with chmod.

Maybe a gander at the xargs man page will send you in the right direction.
Also, it's a common enough issue that you can probably force Google to
cough up an answer for you... but, of course, it can be finicky about
needing just the right search terms.

HTH, best of luck.

I would do this with find as you suggested. Find does have an option to
only search for files. Here's my first guess:

 find -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

maybe run this in a small directory with a few files before turning it

That's what I'd do too, except (and I'm sure wes knows this) you'll 
want a directory as the first argument:

   find $HOME -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

It'll pick up your dot files along with everything else that stat()s 
as a regular file.

my find takes . as the default location if one is not specified. YMMV.

Oh dear!

 :    I inadvertently changed permissions on all directories and 
 : files in my ~/ to 755 (including the dot files, of course). Only 
 : the directories should have those perms; regular files should be 
 : 644.

Especially if you are on a multiuser machine, I would suggest doing 
something like this right away:

  cd ~ && chmod 0700 -- .gnupg .ssh .mozilla .thunderbird

 :    I want to correct this as quickly as possible, but I cannot 
 : find an option in the chmod man page that will ignore directories 
 : while changing all other files. There's probably a scripting 
 : approach using file and exec, but I've not done anything like 
 : this before so guidance on how to restore the appropriate perms 
 : will be very helpful.

As for recursively changing permissions, this is something that is 
always fraught with difficulty.  If you plan on managing your 
filesystems using unix tools regularly, then investing some time in 
learning the power of find, can pay dividends.

Here's a sample, but this is something that is worth 
experimentation.  Try this in a tmp directory or some sandbox before 
doing it for real.

Note, that I'm so nervous about these sorts of commands, that I 
sometimes throw an 'echo' in the command line to see what would be 
run.  I will do that below.  Anyway, here are some examples:

Change all directory permissions to 0700 (restrictive):

  find "$DIR" -type d -print0 \
    | xargs --null --no-run-if-empty -- echo chmod 0700 --

Change all file permissions to 0644 (standard permissive):

  find "$DIR" -type f -print0 \
    | xargs --null --no-run-if-empty -- echo chmod 0644 --

Change all files in this directory to 0600 (restrictive):

  find "$DIR" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type f -print0 \
    | xargs --null --no-run-if-empty -- echo chmod 0600 --

These are just some quick tips.  The find manpage is extensive...of 
course, part of the problem is figuring out where to begin!  I would 
also note that there's a long-standing feud between people who 
suggest:

  find ... -exec {} \;

The more current crowd, who suggest:

  find ... -exec {} +

And, some who suggest:

  find  ... | xargs ...

In all of the above, I'm assuming GNU find, as well, which is subtly 
different from some of the other implementations of 'find' you may 
find in the field.

Best of luck in fixing your home directory!

HI

I plan on coming Sunday  and bringing two old computers.  I would like to
install Mint 9 on one of them.

Thanks

See, that's what using BSD find will do: make me forget GNU defaults. 
You're absolutely right. Linux systems invariably use GNU find, which 
defaults to using the current directory if one isn't specified.

Here's the BSD output when a directory isn't specified:

   [heinlein at springwater ~]$ find -type f
   find: illegal option -- t
   find: illegal option -- y
   find: illegal option -- p
   find: illegal option -- e
   find: f: No such file or directory

Loop through a listing of the first level directory (~/)
    for each file that is not a directory, chmod
    for each file is a directory
       Loop through a listing of that directory
... etc ...

Need help writing that?  On line or off line?

Caution ... be sure that is what you want to do ... might want to run 
the program first, printing out what it would do, without actually doing it.

Hope that helps

> If someone brings a washtub and some old disks, we can play

In all seriousness, the region of Thailand that makes parts for
60% (?) of the world's hard drives got flooded, and if you have
been following the news (or the Frys ads) you've noticed that
supplies are dwindling and prices are skyrocketing.  The Thai
are probably taking this with their usual good humor and
detachment (google "Mai Pen Rai"), but Westerners tend to fret.

That said, today's Fry's ad shows the HITACHI 3TB USB 2.0 External
Hard Drive 0S03290 for $120.  The thing has a ridiculously slow
interface on it, perhaps 12MB/sec according to some reviews.
On the other hand, according to other reviews it has a Hitachi
HDS723030ALA640 6Gb/s SATA hard drive inside (not verified!). 
This cheap box is not designed to be taken apart, so all you
have to do is destroy the case to get at the drive inside :-/

If anyone will be needing a bare hard drive anytime soon, and
you are willing to bend, fold, spindle, and mutilate a case
and a warranty, buy one these from Frys (before they run out)
and bring it to the clinic.  We can pry the thing open together
and get the bare drive working in an eSATA drive toaster
connected to my laptop, or to a SATA-II port inside your desktop. 

Let me know before Sunday, and remind me to bring the enclosure,
some safety glasses, and sharp tools.

Keith

   I used . as the directory since I was running it from ~/. But, I'll run it

   I didn't need to do this before, and in a root login shell that's not
necessary, either. I think this is related to my borked shell login scripts
since the line wrapping broke, too.

Seems like there's not a lot of people who have dealt with this before,
since you're not exactly drowning in responses right now. I can't think of
anything off the top of my head either that could cause this, so I would
suggest trying to go about this another way. One thing you could try is
posting your login config files somewhere, and we can look through and see
if anything jumps out to us as odd.

Sites like pastebin are excellent for this sort of thing.

Files to look at include, but are not limited to:

.shrc
.profile
.bash_profile
.bashrc

and anything that is called from within these files.

Wes,

   What I'll do is back up my .bash* and copy those from /root/. This will
tell me if the problem is in either of those two files. Then I'll figure out
the next step. :-)

   And I was actually supposed to get work done for two clients today. Sigh.

I assume you have no backups, you naughty boy.  We should
spank you, and if we need to wear the black high-heeled
boots, it will cost you extra.  :-?


The problem is, you may have some executables and special files
in your personal directory (perhaps made by some of the apps
you use).  There are also files that want to be user-read-only
for security, and some system programs will get cranky (gnome
may fail to start, for example) with those files set to 644
"promiscuous read" mode.

So you do not want to chmod the files to 644.  A better way is
to chmod the files (and not the directories or executables) to
"a-x", which means user/group/others -not- executable.  That makes
fewer assumptions about permissions on the read and write bits.

First, set up another user and run your usual apps as that user.
That should create a lot of files with the correct permissions,
which you can reference as you fix your own account.  You
need to know what all the permissions are, including dot
directory files like the firefox/mozilla password database,
or ".dbus/session-bus", for example.  That could take a 
while, but you will have a reference to compare to, the next
time something gets goofed up.

The elegant method is to use "find" and "exec" and "chmod"
in one long line that looks like line noise.  But if you
aren't sure what you are doing, it could get you in even
more trouble.  So I suggest the slow and stupid way.

First, "find" all the files in your directory, and redirect
the list to a BIG text file ( 790K lines on my laptop )

    cd ~
    find . -type f > big_file

You will probably see a few errors about directories you
don't have permission to access.  Ignore them, you also did
not have permission to break them.  Unless you were root
when you broke them.  In that case, the revolver is in
the top right drawer, you must do the honorable thing ...

Rather than process big_file with a script, you should text
edit it, mostly to remove the names of files that should not
get changed, or be handled differently - refer to the files
of the example user.  While you edit, globally replace the
start of the line with "chmod a-x".  In vi:

    :%s/^/chmod a-x /

Then you can run "sh big_file" and all the lines in big_file
will execute as commands.  That is slow and inelegant, but a
lot more understandable.  It is critical that you understand
what is happening.

This is a surprisingly large amount of work, without backups
to refer to.  But imagine what it would be like with a GUI
and a mouse.

Another clinic activity, sounds like.  You really should do
nightly backups...

Keith,

   You assume incorrectly. What I discovered as I copied backups from the
dirvish collection is that the copies took on the permissions of the
existing files, the perms were not changed to those that existed yesterday.
That's when I stopped restoring from the external backup disk and asked for
help.

Look at doit, to make sure that it's right, then copy it to your real disk
and execute it.

Wes, et al.:

   I think the problem has to do with urxvt here. When that's the default
terminal all users (including root) see the command line shift left when
it's long. However, if I su to root or postgres with a login shell (the '-'
option), then open an xterm window, a long command line wraps as it did with
rxvt before I changed to the -unicode version. That is, long command lines
shift left with urxvt (and now rxvt, too), but not with xterm. However, if I
open an xterm window from my login shell a long command line still shifts.

   Others running Slackware rxvt-unicode don't have this problem so it must
be something local to my system. The rxvt-unicode package was built from the
SlackBuild script and the maintainer of that script cannot see the same
behavior (but he wrote that left-shifting is the default behavior of
virtual terminals in his experience).

   None of this makes sense to me; it's well beyond my experience as a
part-time SysAdmin and long time linux apprentice.

Ali,

   This problem was resolved by 1) changing all directories and files to 755,
then 2) changing just the files to 644 with the find command. Finally, 3) I
changed all shell scripts to be executable.

   Now I want to fix the left shifting long command lines in virtual
terminals created by urxvt/rxvt-unicode.

Thanks,

Rich

   We'll make do, Keith. But, you can bring your black lace stockings and

   I'll bring my new Jetway Atom-based system, the external USB optical disk,
and a couple of hard drives on which I want to install
Slackware-13.37/64-bit. I have the DVD with the distribution on it, but I
don't have room here to set up the monitor, keyboard, and system.

   One hard drive will replace the -13.1/32-bit drive in my

I already have the Slackware 13.37/64-bit ISO. We have some blank CDs
and DVDs at the Clinic, so it will take only five minutes or so to burn
you one.

John,

   See above. I subscribe to the automatic renewals and get a DVD with the
32-bit version on one side and the 64-bit version on the other. I think that
my minor financial support to Pat and crew is the responsible thing to do.
(Then again, I contributed money to the SlackBuilds.org crew to help fund a
new server when the old one croaked.)

I always maintain the latest releases of various distros, including
Mint. But that means I just have Mint 11. There are various flavors of
Mint 9:

	http://www.linuxmint.com/release.php?id=13

I have good bandwidth at home, so if you like I will download whichever
one(s) you would like. Better for me to do so from home than to wait
until the Clinic, because Free Geek doesn't have very good bandwidth,
not to mention the time you'll have to sit waiting for it to download.

FWIW I believe Linux Mint 12 is due for final release on Nov 20. I've 
been running the release candidate on my laptop and the experience has 
been flawless. I'm finally happy and productive using GNOME 3 with MGSE 
and a couple of minor additional tweaks; I'll try to blog about my setup 
this weekend and will forward a url to the list when I've done so.

Whipping is more fun, I hear.

And weekly backups to a different place. If you don't stop your
backups right away upon realizing that something has been corrupted,
that will just propagate to your daily backups, rendering them useless
to recover.

That's why you should also do weekly backups to another target location.

Of course the more elegant solution is to collect the backup
iterations by renaming a couple of older copies before copying the
latest version. The Linux distribution cron jobs that backup log files
do this properly.

But even then, I'd still do weekly backups. You might not know for days.

Not to rub it in, but it's also good practice to backup anything
you're about to change before you do it, in this instance your $HOME
directory.

I hope you can recover without too much pain.

   Dirvish runs every night and records the changes to each file. While Keith
keeps his backups forever, I keep daily backups for a month and the weekly
backup (Sunday) for 6 months. In 20 years I've never needed a backup from an
earlier time.

Subject: [PLUG] Setting IP address of WRT54G
Message-ID: <4EC759EE.4020706@comcast.net>

Is it possible to change the IP address range of a WRT54G ver. 6 from
192.168.1.x to 192.168.0.x?

I'm replacing my venerable Netgear router with a Linksys. If you
followed my thread a few weeks ago you might remember I was experiencing
slow download speeds going through the Netgear router. Power cycling the
router cleared that problem a few weeks ago, but didn't this morning --
I got 7.15 Mbps through the router and 25 Mbps connected directly. So I
figured I'd better replace the Netgear with one of the WRT54Gs I have in
the closet.

When I first put the WRT54G in place I connected it to my cable modem
and to my desktop machine. I tried to access the WRT54G's setup at
192.168.1.1 but my desktop machine would not see it. I temporarily
changed my desktop machine's IP address from 192.168.0.253 to
192.168.1.253 and was able to connect to the configuration page on the
router and set it up. After saving the configuration of the router I was
unable to connect to the Internet through it.

Knowing I have multiple problems, I tried to put the Netgear router back
in place for the evening, but it won't talk to the Internet either. I
just got off the phone with a friendly Comcast Tech Support guy who was
able to see the modem, and see that it was passing a signal to the
router. I can connect to the router and see the IP address Comcast has
assigned to the WAN side so I know the connection between the router and
my desktop. (I'm sending this from my laptop, which gets a DHCP provided
IP address, and is connected directly to the modem.)

Any pointers on where to start solving any of this problems will be
appreciated.

Thanks.

Yes, you certainly can. You need to connect to it with a web browser by
typing its IP address in the URL bar. If you don't know its IP address
you can reset it to the factory default 192.168.1.1 (not positive about
the last number) by pushing in on the reset button with a pen or
unfolded paperclip.

In a horrible fix, the building that houses my server farm had a

early friday morning.

My entire network was destroyed, but fortunately we had extra servers 
that we could put to use
and we had backups of our data.

The problem is that we don't have enough RAM for production.

Does anyone have any "PC2 3200R ECC RAM" running around that is 
accessible this weekend?

Wes,

   There's a gzipped tarball of all these dot files on my Web site. It can be
downloaded with wget from
         <http://www.aracnet.com/~rshepard/temp-files/temp-files.tgz>

   Everyone's welcome to pick through them to see if anything might be
preventing line wrapping when the virtual terminal is urxvt (but not when
it's an xterm).

Thanks,

Rich

Thanks, John. I don't know why that didn't work last night. Nor why I was unable to connect through that router last night. But this morning I was able to change the router's inward looking address from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.0.1.

Well, I think things are back to normal. I have the WRT54G running as my 
router, and have its inward facing IP address set to 192.168.0.1. The 
only remaining problem was that my Ubuntu 10.04 desktop could ping the 
router but could not connect to the Internet. I don't know which network 
tool is not the "correct" one for playing with network connections. I 
tried the ones that I could find in System > Administration and System > 
Preferences, but they didn't appear to have any effect. I restarted the 
machine (that was so Winders like -- shudder) and now I can connect.

Since I finally found the place to change the IP address of the router I 
no longer need to worry about changing all the static IP addresses in 
the house. However it would be good to find the correct tool to use. 
I'll Google that later today.

Dick,

   I don't know for sure what the ubuntus call it, but on Slackware it's
inetd. IIRC in xubuntu it's in /etc/network/ or something similar.

Sure enough. In /etc/network there is a file named interfaces. Mine says:

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.0.253
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.0.1

Looks like that's where I would change it if it ever needs changing in 
the future.

Thanks.

I just donated tons of it (guess I should say gigs of it) to free geek a
few weeks ago. They might want to keep it all for their own servers, but I
would think it's worth a phone call.

Robert may not know that dirvish/rsync makes huge nests of really
cheap hardlinks to apparently identical stuff; hence the whole
daily/monthly thing is a bit misleading.  An additional backup,
especially one that is only slightly different than yesterday's,
costs a small fraction of a percent of the image size.

I may have 3000 daily backups, but I actually store only about 20
times as much information as what is on my live disks right now.

When a disk gets full of backups, I swap it out.  One 2TB disk
will store 300 or so daily images of all my machines.  I rotate
3 disks, sporadically (it used to be daily), so the 2TB disks I
am running now will be full in 2014 or so.  By that time, 5TB
disks will be $100, my accumulated data will be twice as big,
and those disks will last until 2018, when 10TB disks will be
$90 (inflation adjusted current dollars).

The main cost of backups is electricity to run the backup server;
when rsync is running, or dirvish is expiring old images, it
draws 100W more than when it is idle.  Expires also mean more
disk activity and wearout.  The electricity cost, and wearout,
are more important to me than getting another year's usage on
the drive.  So I fill the disks, then park them in the fireproof
for a few months, then move them to safe offsite storage.

Keeping daily backups has additional forensic value - if I
see a suspicious file on my machine (and being ignorant, I
see a LOT of suspicious files) I can look its change history
by looking at every backup of the file.  This is easy to do
by counting hardlinks, which can be used to determine the
exact days it changes (Metadata?  Trust but verify!).  I can
look at other activity (RPM updates, email, other projects
going on) to see what also changed that day.  To date, every
suspicious file has had an innocent explanation, but I haven't
stopped being suspicious.  Someday, I may to find a suspicious
change, perhaps months old, that heralds a real threat, enemy
activity.  I may save not only my butt, but all of yours. 

Or not.

If I was running a much larger operation, I would do more to
optimize this, but it works OK now. 

Keith

P.S. - on disk prices;  they are spiking 3X right now because
of the Thai floods.  That is causing unaffected producers to
step up production.  The producers forced to rebuild factories
will build newer, bleeding-edge factories rather than duplicate
older equipment, so I expect this to accelerate improvements. 
In six months, there will be a glut, and hard drive $/TB will
fall below the pre-flood trendline.  I don't know how big the
fall will be, or if the slope will increase ( $/TB has halving
approximately every year for a LONG time), but a backup strategy
based on ever-cheaper storage has worked for a decade so far.  
When I switched from tape (anybody remember that stuff?), my
backup drives were 80GB and cost a lot more than scarce 2TB
drives cost now.  Then as now, the main cost of backups is
paying attention to them.

Help Bill out, people!

Bill Ensley's company, Bear Printing, has been using Linux and
printing PLUG business cards for free since forever.  He is an
excellent fellow, and a great supporter of our group (and never
ever flamed me on the list even when I deserved it). 

If we ever write a manifesto, he will probably print it for us.
Bill is key to our quest for world domination.

He is too modest to toot his horn, so I will.

I do not have the RAM - it went to Free Geek a couple of months
ago.  They are likely to have something.  Free Geek volunteers,
please see what you can find. 

PC2 3200 is about 2003-2005 time frame, AFAIK.  PLEASE dig
through your old machines and scrap drawers and find memory
for Bill. 

You can bet Bill is busy as hell (one fire equals three moves)
so anybody living out near Tigard can help move materials to
him, perhaps help him get the replacement machines configured
and running.

I may have some useful ethernet cables, old PC cases, and
other random bits of cruft that may be useful.  Mi chatarra
es su chatarra, amigo!

This is a great opportunity to show the world that the Linux
community takes care of its own.  Help Bill!

Keith

Subject: [PLUG] Leftover package from Fc14 > Fc16 upgrade
Message-ID: <20111119141339.59e4bb8a@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I usually do package stuff on my Fedora x86_64 laptop (now version 16)
with Yumex, but I can't seem to solve this problem from the command
line either.

After the upgrade to Fedora 16 Yumex listed over 800 packages to
update. It took the better part of a day to get them all updated due to
missing dependencies and all kinds of other problems. Some I had to
delete, although in each case where I deleted a package it was one that
I have no use for anyway. For example, I found three packages for
mutter-meego, a netbook version of something. Yumex refused to update
them, and there was no erase option for packages listed as updatable,
nor were there original packages installed for any of them. But from
the command line yum was happy to erase them.

However, I have one stray package that nothing can touch: 

	qparted 0.4.5-26.fc15.

Yumex insists that this package needs to be updated. But searching on
"parted" reveals parted and gparted (both installed), but no package
qparted. From the command line yum says there is no package qparted.
Because apparently it does not exist I can't erase it, get info about
it, or otherwise touch it. Yet Yumex (and the separate Software Update
utility) stubbornly insist that it needs to be updated. I have also
done "yum clean all" with no luck. 

Does anyone have any idea how to get Yumex to stop listing this package
as updatable?

Thank you all, we have found a bit of ram and had some success over a 
EcoBinary,
but we are still looking for more ram, 1 to 2gb chips if possible, the 
servers we are
running have 6 slots.

We will upgrade to newer machines once the insurance comes through, but 
until
then I need to make due.

Subject: [PLUG] Buying a used laptop - questions
Message-ID: <4EC83721.4020902@pcnetinc.com>

I'm attempting to move to Linux. As I've had some near 
disasters with attempting to have Linux coexist with Windows 
and there is no physically nearby Linux support (rural SW 
MO), I will purchase a used laptop for a test bed that will 
be a pure Linux machine - probably with multiple distros on it.

The local used computer store seems to have a assortment of 
Dell, Toshiba, and Acer. Any gotcha's to watch for?

I know of two potential driver problems, video and modem.
Video drivers - I've seen much about problems with nVidia(sp?).
   * Can I fall back to a "lowest common denominator"?
   * Any other chip sets I should watch out for?

At home I'm restricted to dial-up access I have to deal with 
modem issues and will assume that any internal modem will be 
a "win modem(sic or sick?). I have a USB USRobotics modem 
which operates as long as the kernel is recent enough. If 
the internal modem works it will be considered a bonus.

For downloading larger files I'll use the Wifi hotspot at 
local library. Will I have problems there?

One other question, to extend battery life how likely will I 
be able to force the hard drive off and write only to a USB 
stick?

What else do I not know enough to realize I should be asking 
other question ;/

TIA

   I've installed and run linux on several Toshiba models (4, actually) with
no problems. I've also experience with an IBM ThinkPad 600E (too old, don't
buy one), a Sony Vaio, and my current portable, the Dell Latitude. Most
distributions will work well on these.

   Don't assume winmodems any longer. The world's moved past that as far as I
know.

   My suggestion is to get a live disk that boots a ubuntu (I favor xubuntu
but that's because I've used xfce for very many years). Take the disk with
you and use it to boot prospective machines. You'll see if it recognizes
everything in the case, including wifi and video. If it does, buy the box
and installed from the disk.

   Rather than futzing with a bunch of distributions, pick one and make sure
the hardware you buy supports it. Then use it long enough to form an opinion
whether it meets _your_ needs and suits _your_ preferences. Then you can
consider changing distributions.

   Of course, if your purpose is to tinker with linux then my suggestion is
withdrawn. I'm assuming (perhaps incorrectly) that you want to use the
portable for work and any distribution that does what you need in a way that
you understand will do.

Good luck,

Rich

If I followed what you were trying to do; here is what I've done in the 
past.

Tell my system using the arp command which IP address is assigned to 
which MAC address.

    arp -s <IP> <MAC>

An example from my home workstation.

    arp -s 192.168.3.42 00:18:39:78:82:37

Be sure to select an IP in your local network's block that is not 
currently being used.  Most special purpose devices have the MAC address 
printed on the label (on the bottom).

Then use the above IP to access the device.  Once connected you can make 
the changes using the device's control/configuration interface.

A couple of months back I finally upgraded the memory and hard disk on 
my Acer Aspire 1640z laptop which I bought new back in 2006 -- I think. 
I have it running as a dual boot machine with WinXP and Ubuntu 10.04. 
While I can't say anything about the dial-up modem, I can say that 
Ubuntu handles all the rest of the hardware very well. Wireless worked 
out of the box, and it appears to be happy with the power related 
aspects of the hardware, too. I can close the lid on the running 
machine, come back later, open the lid, push the power button, feed it 
my password and be right back where I was when I closed the lid. I can't 
speak for how long the battery will last under that condition because I 
usually leave it plugged in.

The OpenOffice.org problems are because I have real OOo from OOo, not

supposedly installed LibreOffice (I think). I remember seeing a package
libreoffice-ure being installed. I think this is as good a time as any
to switch to LibreOffice, so that's how I'll resolve the OOo problem.

Also, Scribus won't launch, nor will any part of OOo. I tried
reinstalling Scribus but got dependency errors relating to python
(Scribus uses python for scripting).

I think I'll work on Scribus and OOo/LibreOffice first.

OK, everything fixed. Originally neither Yumex nor yum from the command
line would update qtparted, nor did either list it as installed. But
just now from the command line yum was happy to uninstall it.

I also successfully reinstalled Scribus and switched to LibreOffice
from OpenOffice.org. In reference to the latter, it was trivial; just
make a copy of your ~/.openoffice config folder (which may have
different names depending on version and platform) and name it
~/.libreoffice. And the remaining problems were resolved by
uninstalling the offending apps, since I saw no need for them.

Subject: [PLUG] Lost root password
Message-ID: <20111119210900.423c1ef7@mailhost.pdx.edu>

During the recent mel?e of trying get X running again after upgrading
from Fedora 14 to Fedora 16 I somehow lost my root password. That is,
it no longer works. 

Sudo still works, and I can "sudo su" to a root # prompt, but if I type
"su" and enter the root password it won't take it. I've poked in all
the GUI windows for users and groups, but can't figure out how to reset
the root password. 

It used to be that "su" + root password got me to #, and I could "su
jjj" to switch back to my own lovable self. I don't mind using sudo,
but sometimes you need to do a lot of stuff and having to put sudo in
front all the time is a pain. Plus, Fedora doesn't remember your sudo
password for ten minutes or so like Ubuntu does.

Can someone point me in the right direction to restore my root
password?

I understand there are differences between sudo and actually being
root. Do these make me really root? 'Cause I need to feel the power.

And why could I become root with just su before, but now it won't take
the password?

It's entirely possible that root logins have been disabled. (This is a good thing.) That would explain why it works with sudo su -, but doesn't work with su -.

Sudo uses the password of your current user.

Su uses the password of the user you are switching to.

With either if you don't specify which user to switch to default to root.
The timeout for Sudo is configurable. The -i sudo option gives an
interactive shell which doesn't timeout. The passwd command changes the
password for the current user if none is specified. It requires the current
password to change it unless the current effective user is the root user
and then the current password is not required.

Sudo'ing to root, and resetting the password ought to make su work
again. 

I personally like: "sudo -s" to get a root shell, the you can "passwd
root" or maybe even just "passwd" to reset the root password.

Caps Lock? :-)

I am not a Fedora user, so maybe it's some new kevlar-sock thing
(i.e. to prevent you shooting yourself in the foot).

Correct, unless you are root switching to another user, then su doesn't require a password at all.

> With either if you don't specify which user to switch to default to root.

sudo gives one the ability to run a subset of programs, or all, as specified in the config file. This could give one root privileges, or let you run programs as a different user, say 'postgres' for instance. That way, you can give someone the ability to run a task as a different user, without giving them the key to the whole system. 

I don't believe sudo has a 'default' user it runs things at. 

If a user does not have the ability to run su under sudo, then they can't switch to another users login.

I planned to sort of flip that procedure to achieve the same
goal. The store has a batch of computers in their back room
that have yet to go thru their checkout procedure - due out
in ~1 week. They will send me a list of make, model, ram,
disk size, and price. I'll do some research and make an
initial choice from that information. I do have several
distros on CD &/or USB to use for a final Go/NOGO test.

Who me? Tinker?
Left out one environmental issue - I'm *RETIRED* .

Long term, maybe dream rather than goal, a lean mean 
computing machine.
I don't like the glitzy swiss army knife approach of MS and 
some Linuxes.

I've a Live CD of Ubuntu 10.10 and found it doesn't include
dial up out of the box. I'm given to understand that it is
in repository. For my philosophy that creates a serious
down-check.

I think that's correct, dial-up stuff is not included in the CD. I set 
up a ubuntu desktop machine for a friend in Gales Creek and had to 
download some ppp stuff at my house where I had DSL and then take the 
machine out to Gales Creek.

man page says it is so, you must use -u to sudo to a non-root user:

  -u user     The -u (user) option causes sudo to run the specified command as a user other than root.

And remember, polite sysadmins:

  $ alias please=sudo

I'm in Tigard, and my day job is a sysadmin. Let me know if I can help.

One thing that should be noted is the RAM he needs is Registered RAM...
desktop (unregistered) chips won't work.

I hope someone called Freegeek yesterday. If not, I will check with them
tomorrow.

Hi All,

Yes, ECC is what we need and why it is hard to get.

As of about 4:00am we were able to get baselined with a temporary network.

Thank you all for the moral support and offers of help.

We are still looking for RAM, 1 and 2gb chips, we were able to find 
quite a bit
of 512mb chips, but really need larger.

I did go to Free Geek yesterday and was told that they have none.

Fortunately I think we will now make it to tomorrow where I can get to 
MemoryTime
and I know they have it.

Thanks again all,

-Bill Ensley

What is "Registered RAM"? I've played with computers for ~50 
years and
never run across that term ;)

Laymans answer:

Technically it's called ECC Ram or Error Correcting Ram

There is a 9th chip on the stick that keeps the other 8 in line.

I'm sure someone else here will give a more technical answer, but that's 
all i've got.

"*Registered* (also called *buffered*) *memory* modules

Registered memory is often more expensive because of the lower volume

Subject: [PLUG] Samba Slow Handshake
Message-ID: <4EC98E1E.6050300@comcast.net>

I'm running Ubuntu 10.04, Lucid Lynx, with the standard Gnome desktop. 
When I click on Places > Network I get a quickly opened window showing 
this machine, and Windows Network. When I double click on Windows 
Network it takes a couple of seconds and I get HOUSE and WORKGROUP, the 
two different Windows network names in use. When I double click on HOUSE 
it takes about 15 seconds to show me an icon for my wife's machine. It 
takes another 15 seconds after double clicking on that icon before I see 
the icons for the different shares on her machine, and another 10 
seconds to open one of the shares. After that, file transfer is fast 
enough that I can't say there's any delay.

I get a similar experience connecting to my Lucid Laptop when going 
through Samba. Oddly, the icon for my laptop used to appear in Places > 
Network along with an icon for this machine. That was after building 
this machine a few weeks ago and before installing Samba. Now, in order 
to get to my Lucid Laptop I have to click Places > Network > Windows 
Network > WORKGROUP to see the laptop's icon.

Is this some kind of security handshaking that is different with the 
Samba that installed last month vs the Samba that ran fine for over a 
year on my old machine, which was also running Lucid?

Any ideas on what to tweak so that I can get quicker connect times to 
machines on my local network?

Thanks.

"package-cleanup --orphans" is useful as it tells you what packages
you have installed that are not available from a currently configured

As Fred J. points out, there are both non-registered and registered
versions of ECC RAM.  Registered ECC RAM is almost always found in
servers, but plain ECC RAM is sometimes supported by consumer-grade
motherboards.

Anyway, as soon as I saw the 3200*R* in Bill's request, I knew I
didn't have what he needed.

Doesn't work:

Subject: [PLUG] Fixing grub boot
Message-ID: <20111121074330.GB23209@gate.kl-ic.com>

At Clinic today, Wes and I frobbed around helping John Jordan fix
the hosed grub2 boot on his Fedora 16 laptop.  We learned quite a
bit, found a few dead ends, and based on that I will outline a
simpler way to fix things next time.  John was busy helping others
while we worked on his laptop, so I am guessing he is interested,
too.

Fedora is installed to boot the kernel with "rhgb", which shows
a pretty picture instead of the long list of console messages 
that all True Geeks want to see during startup.  It also installs
with lvm, logical volume management, which is useful for some
systems, but complicates bootup simple systems.  And it uses
grub2, which fills /boot with all sorts of funny little files
that are supposed to be written by grub2-mkconfig from other
funny little files in /etc .  OK when it works, a P.I.T.A. if
you make a small mistake while fooling with grub.

Which John did.  John edited /etc/default/grub, and removed
rhgb from the "linux /vmlinuz- ..." line.  And accidentally
created a two character error later in that line (which looks
like line noise anyway).  He saved the original line after a #
comment just above (good practice), but just this once he missed
the other good practice of replacing "rhgb" with "    " (four
blanks), so that the two lines were easy to compare.  That
made the typo (turning the fragment "lv=" into "lv=v=" harder
to spot.  When he did "grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.conf",
that screwed up the some files in /boot/grub2 .   Grub still
worked enough to load initrd, a tiny-toy version of a kernel
and tools, but everything necessary to run grub2-mkconfig again,
including the script itself, was on unmounted LVM partitions.

How to fix this?

I won't go into all the dead ends.  The simplest way to fix it
approximates the following (I didn't write enough notes, some 
of this is from memory, some is simplified, YMMV):

-------------------
mkdir /boot
mkdir /r
mount /dev/mapper/vg_devil8-lv-root /r
mount /dev/mapper/vg_devil8-lv-boot /boot

/r/bin/vi /r/etc/default/grub  
   (find the typo fragment, WRITE DOWN WHAT IT IS, and fix it)

/r/bin/grep [typofragment] /boot/grub2/*
   (find the files with the typos - probably /boot/grub2/grub2.cnf)

/r/bin/vi /boot/grub2/[file with typos]
   fix the typos in each affected file

umount /r
umount /boot
-------------------

Pray, or sacrifice a goat, or cross fingers, or whatever works for you.

Hit the power switch (shutdown -r  and reboot are not available)
and restart.  With luck, and perhaps some fixes to the instructions
above, you should have fixed the /etc/default/grub typo that
propagated into /boot/grub2/ , and the machine will boot normally.


This is excessively difficult.  There should be a small binary
in the initrd image that will help you fix grub.  Or the live
CD should have more tools for this.  Or the edit window available
during grub2 boot when you hit "e" should show the "linux" line
(it didn't) so that it can be edited during bootup.  The older
grub on my RHEL5 laptop permits this, and is a much easier way to
work around grub.conf typos.  This may be a bug in grub2 or FC16.


BTW, some may differ, but when I install redhat/fedora systems,
I usually go into custom partitioning and set my own partitions,
avoiding LVM.  LVM is nice when it works, and permits all sorts
of fancy resizing of partitions across physical media, but it
is quite a bit more complicated to debug.  For this and other
reasons, I set up my systems without LVM.  


If there are flaws in the above, I hope someone will post a 
corrected or simplified version.  I hope the result will permit
others to make this fix in a few minutes, rather than the two
hours Wes and I spent on a fascinating but time-needed-elsewhere
frobbing festival.

That's a bit surprising.  During my recent Mythbuntu 11.10 install(s),
I often used the grub2 edit menu to remove "quiet splash" from the
kernel command line.  Sounds like a bug to me.

Odd.  The "linux" line _is_ shown on my Dell Inspiron 9300 laptop.
I wonder why it wasn't on John's machine.  Is it now, after things
were fixed?

Grub2 seems to work well enough here.  I have yet to change
anything in it, but I'm sure I will -- I always do.  Then I'll
find out just how badly it sucks.  Fortunately, I don't have to
meddle with the boot setup much.  BTW, subtle typos can cause just
as much grief in Old Grub as then can in New Grub.  I spent an
entertaining hour or so (for certain values of 'entertaining') tracking
down why my F14 system wouldn't boot.  Turned out to be a
one-character typo that I kept not seeing.  *sigh*

Like John, I had some difficulty getting the nVidia driver to work
correctly.  Turns out there is a set of incompatibilities with the
driver, certain cards (the older GeForce Go series), and certain
revs of the Linux kernel.  I finally got things to work with a
down rev kernel and nVidia driver.  Fun times.  The nouveau driver
works fairly well, but it doesn't support the native resolution of
the LCD, making the display rather fuzzy and distorted (wrong
aspect ratio).  That said, the new drivers, nVidia and nouveau,
both work far better than the ones I had from F12.  Smooth and
clean, with no weird glitchy artifacts, which the older drivers
had.

Heh, I've always gone the custom partitioning route, ever since I
started with Linux.  I've found that troubleshooting and fixing an
LVM2 setup isn't appreciably more difficult that a standard
setup.  I've had to fix both, and I find that a recent live CD is

When I get to the Privacy screen I have to click on "remove individual 
cookies" to get to the list of cookies. The box to uncheck to "Accept 
cookies from sites" isn't there. To get to that option I had to choose 
"Use custom settings for history" from the "Firefox will: " drop down 
box under the History heading. That changes the Privacy window so that I 
have a button for "Exceptions..." and another for "Show Cookies...". 
When I click on "Show Cookies..." I get a separate "Cookies" window with 
buttons to remove individual cookies or all cookies.

> Go through the list and delete all cookies for websites that you don't

I looked at that list and saw dozens of cookies that I could tell were 
places that I don't visit often. I decided the easier way to test things 
would be to save a copy of my Firefox profile and then clear all cookies 
and start fresh.

I unchecked "Accept cookies from sites" and then visited a site I 
remember needing cookies set. Sure enough it didn't work right, so I 
clicked on "Exceptions..." and added that site to the list. After that 
it worked correctly.

The next site I discovered needed an exception is Comcast's web e-mail 
interface. I could get as far as the sign in page. But after typing in 
my user name and password I was kicked back to the preceding page. I 
tried adding that web site as an exception but that didn't work. It only 
worked again when I rechecked "Allow cookies from sites".

After doing that and visiting the Comcast e-mail site I found Comcast 
sets 28 cookies on eight "Sites" two of which aren't Comcast - one was 
from Yahoo and the other was from Google. I clicked on "Remove All 
Cookies" again, and unchecked "Accept third-party cookies" and now I get 
26 cookies on six "Sites" and Google and Yahoo are not there.

One other thing to try later is to allow exceptions for all six Comcast 
sites and see if that will let me uncheck "Accept cookies from sites".

Very nice. I installed that and see many tracking attempts blocked on 
various pages I visit.

   I see cookies from sites that I've not visited (such as yahoo, but as you
write below, that might be an unintended consequence of visiting a news site
or google.

   Since I've always set firefox to clear all cookies when I shut down the
application I'll see if there are residuals tomorrow when I log in and open
firefox.

Hi

I have Mint 9... The 32 bit gnome version..

I boot it and I get a command line..

I have googled the Mint site and haven't found the key..

What do I do from the Command Line to install Mint 9?

I was expecting the install disk to come up and ask me if I wanted to
install?

Hi,

Not sure if this was brought up already- is there a particular reason you
are using an old version of Mint?
They are on 11 now, and 12 is on the way soon.

Also, can you describe the command line you are getting?
Is it a standard bash prompt?

(yourusername)@(yourcomputername)$  (standard user prompt)

or

(yourusername)@(yourcomputername)#   (a root level prompt)

or are you getting a prompt like this:

grub>     (the grub boot prompt, if you get this there is a hang up in the
boot process or the installer)

This info will help us narrow down what might be happening.

Are you booting a live CD version or the installer only version?

Can you use shift+up-arrow or shift+page-up to scroll the screen up, to see
any error messages?

It is possible your configuration isn't supported for X video mode with the
default settings.

I would suggest if possible to try the recent live CD of Mint 11, or
possibly a recent version of Knoppix, just to see if it can boot and bring
up X11.

Something has changed on my machine with regards to the amount of time

don't recall if there were any updates to Java or Open Office recently

Is there some way to have Open Office partly loaded at boot time in

Dick,

   OO.o is no longer. Grab LibreOffice-3.4.3 (or 3.4.4, whichever is the most
current) and use that to replce what you have. Same data files work fine. LO
is not as complete as OO.o was, but it may well get there.

I've heard that LO is taking over. I use OO for production, so I'm 
hesitant to jump ship too quickly. I'll test out LO on my laptop and see 
if anything I count on is missing.

Nothing is missing from LO I have been using it for two release cycles

Unless your sending large attachments bandwidth should very rarely have
a impact on
your sending e-mail. If anything your DNS lookups are slow or perhaps
there is a issue on the server
that handles SMTP.

   I use it infrequently and reluctantly. Primarily to convert Excel files to
.ods files and reformat them. A couple of operations I could do in OO.o are
apparently not yet implemented in LO.

   BTW, if you want to sort by columns in Calc, you need to uncheck the
'include header rows' option as well as selecting the bottom-most
radiobutton to sort horizontally rather than vertically. Not intuitive, but
necessary.

I made the CD for Marvin at the Clinic on Sunday. Marvin
specifically wanted Mint 9 because it is long term support.

I don't know what the Mint 9 CD is supposed to look like. It is
possible that the CD is bad. I burned it with K3b and it passed the
hash test. The download was just a few days ago. I've never installed
Mint, so I don't know much about the installer but, being Mint, I would
be surprised if the installer isn't a GUI. I suspect something is
wrong, but I don't know what.

I am getting

mint at mint~$

Full screen command line..

I have Ubuntu 8.10 on the box.  So I feel X should not be a problem..

I get an initial splash screen when Mint first boots off the CD...

No attachments. The router has Comcast supplied DNS IP addresses of 
75.75.75.57 and 75.75.75.76, which is what they've been for at least 
several months. It could be on their end, but I don't know if there's 
any way I'd be able to tell.

Thanks. I'll give LO a try.

Check those DNS entries as Comcast's DNS servers are actually

I just converted from OOo to LO, and it was trivial. 

1) Make a copy of your ~/.openoffice folder. (Depending on which
release of OOo you have it may be called various things.) Rename the
original ~/.libreoffice.

2) Uninstall OOo.

3) Install Libreoffice.

4) Fire up LibreOffice and it will have all your settings, templates,
extensions and other stuff just as it was in OOo. Other than the name
in the titlebar you won't see any difference.

   I've looked at the emacs wiki regex page and tried a couple of different
ways to put single quotes around dates in a large data file, but I've no
succeeded. I'd appreciate some help here.

   The dates are in SQL INSERT INTO statements delineated with commas and of
the ISO standard YYYY-MM-DD. I've tried the regex search-and-replace using
[:digit:] and [0-9] for each digit in the dates but that's not doing the
job; I get the search string inserted rather than the original date
surrounded by single quotes.

   I'm far from a regex expert despite having read the ORA regex book a while
ago and the emacs wiki just now. I don't use them enough to have become
fluent.

Pointers appreciated,

What do your search and replace strings look like?  I'd expect
something like this.

search:  ,\(date_match_pattern\),
replace: ,'\1',

I believe you want something like:

M-x replace-regexp
query = \([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]\)
replace = '\1'

Note that you may want to add context to that, and there is
*certainly* a shorter way to express four digits in a row...

Don't forget to put the point at the top of the file first.

<snip>

I don't know from Ubuntu, which you said you're using, but Open Office
(and Libre Office) use Java, specifically the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) that is distributed by Oracle (nee Sun) or some other developer.

The starting point for learning what release of JRE you have
installed: http://www.java.com/en/ . Of course that likes the
'official' version.

I use the 'official' Sun (now Oracle) Java because I've found that
some other versions, like the "Iced Tea" Java maintained by my
distribution, (Mandriva), don't play well with a Java applet that I
use under Firefox.

That Java applet is an online poker client-in-the-web-browser that's at:
https://www.free-bwin.com/poker.aspx . It doesn't require Windows, yay!

(You're all welcome to come play poker for play money but I should
warn you that I have a 'bankroll' of almost $900k and don't take
prisoners.)

So, every once in awhile Mandriva decides to update its version of
Iced Tea, so I allow it to do that. Then... I remove the package
immediately using Mandriva's quite handy GUI-based RPM package
maintenance facility.

I always check to make sure it's truly gone by using "about:plugins"
in Firefox. Lately Firefox has this online under Tools -> Add-ons for
this.

Also, I occasionally update the version of Java that's on my system,
by downloading the latest version from http://www.java.com/en/ and
placing that into effect. That process requires that I remove the
older version first, then make the install file executable using chmod
a+x [filename] and run the the install file, which installs the RPM
and all libraries.

There's also a version of the latest 'official' Sun/Oracle Java
upgrade for Debian based Linux systems.

To tell Firefox where to find Java, I create a link to the Java
runtime launcher as root as follows, using the latest version for this
example:

cd /usr/local/firefox/plugins  # the latest Firefox lives in /usr/local
ln -sf /usr/java/jre1.6.0_29/lib/i386/libnpjp2.so libnpjp2.so

And Open Office is happy, too. I keep only the one version of Java as
I don't have any use for it other than to run Open Office and play poker.

ls -al /usr/java # date/time data removed for readability
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   16 default -> /usr/java/latest/
drwxr-xr-x  7 root root 4096 jre1.6.0_29/
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   21 latest -> /usr/java/jre1.6.0_29/

Robert

Subject: [PLUG] Need Virtualization Advice
Message-ID: <CAEqej2NGtVWiv0=2MNLGFby7uSDhC75N3S68Sd8Ni=zju71ELA@mail.gmail.com>

I have managed to fill up my laptop's dual boot (Win 7 and Debian testing)
320 GB drive, so I have a new shiny 750 GB drive to install. I have tried
to use Clonezilla, and it keeps failing because the old drive has 512 byte
sectors and the new drive has 4096 byte sectors. No problem; I will just
create a system image of the Windows partitions to move that to the new
drive, net install Debian testing, and copy over my user files.

However, I was thinking that I could get rid of the dual boot and just
virtualize the Windows partition. My questions -

1. Can I create a virtual version of my Windows 7 Home Premium using the
system recovery disk and the backup on my external usb drive? So far, it
installs to the new 750 GB drive with no issues. I don't have any original
media disks.

2. Vmware or Virtualbox? Do either one support usb so I can run iTunes on
my virtual Windows drive? A while ago I was able to get vmware to run off
of the Windows disk partition, but it seemed to break every time I ran an
upgrade on Debian, and it was a pain to get it to work each time. I don't
want to fiddle with this approach again, unless I have to.

Thanks for your suggestions!

Mark

Galen,

   For search I tried ,[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9], and I
coped that with single quotes as the replacement string. Reading the wiki
page I did not see \1 as replace original characters.

   Ah, so. I did not have the groups in parentheses or set off by back
slashes.

> replace = '\1'

   As I wrote in response to Galen's message, I did not find the \1 on the
wiki page.

   And, ... 143,260 lines later that certainly did the trick.

Thank you both for the emacs regex lesson,

The terminology you're looking for is "back reference".
http://www.gnu.org/s/libtool/manual/emacs/Regexp-Replace.html

Oddly, in a quick search of the wiki, I didn't spot it either.  That's
assuming you were referring to emacswiki.org.

Depending on what you have for recovery disks? maybe.

However, Windows tends to install very hardware specific. So when you move to a virtual pc, you'll end up reinstalling drivers. With vmware, this can be as easy as installing vmware tools, which mounts as a virtual disk in the virtual machine. 

There are conversion utilities for vmware to convert live machines to virtual machines. They used to have these available for download on the vmware website, but I haven't had a need to use them in some time, so I don't know if this is still the case. 

> 2. Vmware or Virtualbox?

I like vmware because, like my Mac, it just works. I use vmware fusion on my mac to run Windows, and when I was running a linux box as my main machine, I ran Windows in a vmware session. It's usually quite a while between times I need to run Windows, and when I do, vmware pops right back up.

It virtualizes all the hardware. You can choose to attach the USB/CD/etc hardware to the virtual computer, or not.

I've had decent success with XP on KVM, the Linux native VM solution. My
laptop system stays fairly cool with up to 4VMs running. However, I
haven't tried 7 or used USB devices on it, so YMMV.

Thanks,

My guess is that direct root login is disabled. Just use sudo su or better,

I agree that this feels like a DNS problem. The router probably assigned
itself (192.168.x.1) as the DNS server for all the devices on your network.
So it's acting as a recursive DNS server, and it may be doing so slowly.
The way to test this is to override it, have your machine use comcast's DNS
servers directly. You would need to edit /etc/resolv.conf to accomplish
this.

i would make all the same statements about virtualbox, except hey,
free & open source.

i've never used vmware, though, so i don't know which is better.  but
i'd say both work.  i do know a fair amount about the vmware suite's
featureset, and based on that i'd say vmware is incredibly well suited
to enterprise-level complex stuff.  but i've used virtualbox for
migration over the network and it has worked, so it's not exactly
hobbyist-level-only either.

Virtualbox has the advantage of being dead easy to install and set up,
plus it is open source. However, while Virtualbox has no problem
connecting your virtual machine to devices like the network and audio,
the open source edition (OSE) does not do USB. If you want USB you need
to download the Oracle version. It's still free, but probably not
completely open source.

Hi

Problem solved.

Bad Burns..

I burned a Ubuntu 10.8 here..

Got the same issue as Mint.  Boot to a log in screen..

Found a commercial copy of 10.4 ubuntu.  It booted and is installing fine.

So for some reason the copy burned at Clinic and the copy I burned at home
were both unreadable by my CD reader.......


How strange.....

If someone want to send me a sources list for Mint I will replace the
source list and do update and upgrade on that..

Should work??

TIA


Marvin

PS..

Special thanks to JJJ and Clinic folks..

Sure enough. Here's the contents of my /etc/resolv.conf:

# Generated by NetworkManager
domain comcast.net
search comcast.net
nameserver 192.168.0.1

I see that this is a generated file. I assume that means I need to use 
NetworkManager to make the change. The next question is how do I access 
Network Manager? I find two different tools. In System > Administration 
I find Network Tools, and in System > Preferences I find Network 
Connections and Network Proxy. I've never used Proxy settings before so 
I assume that's not the one. There is no information listed on any of 
the tabs in Network Connections, so that doesn't seem to be correct, 
either. The only tab that seems relevant in Network Tools is Devices, 
but that just appears to provide IP Information rather than letting me 
change anything.

Googling I see a lot of references to replacing Network Manager with 
Wicd. Would that be a better way to go?

Thanks for the info.

   Nope. Any text editor will do.

   I keep a copy of the local version of resolv.conf as resolv.conf.office on
my laptop. This allows me to quickly reset it when I return from using the
portable elsewhere where the local access server puts its own DNS version in
there.

   Depends. The ubuntus appear to come with Network Manager which, IIRC, is
accessed from a terminal as 'nm-applet'. I have wicd on my laptop running
Slackware and my friend's laptop running Xubuntu. Dependable and works fine
for us.

Well, it is already running, but I still don't see a way to actually do 
anything with it:

rsteff at moonguide:~$ nm-applet
An instance of nm-applet is already running.

** (nm-applet:14610): WARNING **: <WARN>  constructor(): Couldn't 
initialize the D-Bus manager.

Perhaps I should give it a try.

This appears to have RESOLVed the problem. I commented out the original 
nameserver line and added:

nameserver: 75.75.75.75

I sent myself a couple of e-mails and they zipped right off the screen.

Thanks.

I noticed that my router has both 75.75.75.75 and 75.75.76.76. Is there 
a way to put in the second one?

Does that really matter?

   Yep ... and yep.

   Write them one under the other; that is:

nameserver 75.75.75.75

Thanks. I wondered if that would be the way it's done.

Very strange, indeed. 

I would not find it unbelievable that my CD burner is going bad - the
machine is a bit over four years old and I have used the optical drive
heavily. So a bad CD from my end is entirely possible.

But then you burned a copy at home using your burner and it was
unreadable. That makes two bad burners in the mix here. The odds are
now getting slimmer. 

If we had this to do over again I should have just put the ISO image on
a USB stick and had you copy it directly onto your hard drive. Then you
would have been able to re-burn it using other hardware until you got a
readable copy. 

On the other hand, if I had a buck for every if and shoulda I could buy
and sell Bill Gates out of my petty cash drawer.

HI

I need to correct myself..

The bad burn is only in respect to my DVD reader...

On another machine, newer, it boots just fine.  And I am assuming would
install.

What we should have tried at the clinic was putting the disk in someone
else's computer to see how it acted.

We did that with mine.  Booted the WIN disk.   So we assumed I was clean.
I am thinking my reader has issues.

Shows you how touchy those readers can be.   And how I didn't do much of a
job of trouble shooting my own machine.

I am still waiting for someone to send me a copy of their Mint sources
list.  Drop that in there and see if it will change distro and upgrade on
the spot..  hehe

Thanks for all the help.

Marvin

VirtualBox requires a separate download for USB 2.0 support. If you're
talking about connecting iTunes with an iPod, I suspect you'll have an
easier time with VMware.

I had similar experiences with VMware. For me, the problem was that
upgrading my distro (Fedora) also upgraded my kernel, and the new
kernel would often have changes that broke the build for VMware's
kernel modules. For me, the solution was to wait for VMware to release
a new update before upgrading my distro.

I use a couple of ASUS EEE boxes in one installation - quiet,
low power, small, DVI+A video.  Intel Atom, x86 architecture.  No
DVD drive - I can plug a USB drive and boot from that if I must.
One runs Linux, the other (cough cough gasp can't say it).
For security reasons, I can't run virtualization on one machine.

The EEE boxes work OK, and I expect ASUS to keep making them. 
One of mine may be getting a little flakey.  Time to buy a
just-in-case spare to minimize downtime.

But before I do, now is a good time to review the landscape.
The ASUS+Atom is just powerful enough.  By now, there may
be more powerful machines of the same size, using the same
power, perhaps more reliable or cheaper.  Perhaps something
with an eSATA port.  

Has anybody seen something better, or at least worth looking at?

Keith

Keith,

   Don't know. I have a Jetway ION-TOP. It has an Intel Atom CPU,
accommodates up to 4G RAM, Realtek 8111DL Gigabit Ethernet chip, 4 SATA2
internally and 1 externally, 4 external USB2 ports, etc. Comes with a power
block on the cord and ... ta da! ... a remote control.

   I'm loading Slackware-13.37/64-bit on it and want to make it into a web
and ftp server.

   Bought it from Newegg.

for applications. In a GUI file browser they are all referred to as
"desktop configuration files" in the File Type column. That is, the GUI
file browser knows that it should classify the file as being of that
sort. But there is no unique extension or other obvious way that the
file browser can tell what kind of file it is.

So how does the file browser know? Do these files emit an odor that only
a file browser can smell? And can I use that aroma in a find or copy
command?

John,

My understanding is that all of these files have names of the form
"<foobar>.desktop" or "<barfoo>.directory".  There may be some
named "<korflplatz>.kdelnk", but the .kdelnk suffix is deprecated.
So far as I know, they shouldn't be named any other way.

All of the .desktop files that I've looked at have "[Desktop
Entry]" as the first line.  The file command tells me that they
are UTF-8 Unicode English text.

The file

<http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/index.html>

is the standard for this type of file.

Hope this helps.

If you have a username and password for Newegg, you could log in and 
pull up your old invoice to get the model number.

galen,

   I'm sure that I do, so I'll see if I can figure out what they are. Since I
purchase from them about every two years remembering my username and password
is not a high priority.

Thanks for the link.

My current task is to edit the application menu in XFCE, which does not
come with a menu editor like Gnome's Alacarte. (Actually, I understand
that Alacarte will no longer run if you have Gnome 3.x.) I found
LXMenuEditor (from LXDE), but it is pretty minimal. I'm finding it
easier to do things by editing the configuration files manually, which
are all just text files. The hard part is figuring out the syntax
required in the text files and how the system works.

One problem is that I find desktop files in /usr/share/applications and
also in ~/.local/share/applications, and sometimes in other places as
well. Frequently there are duplications, and sometimes the app shows up
in various places in the menus and sometimes not at all, and without
regard to how many copies of the desktop file there are. There must be a
system to this mess, and it would be easier to figure it out if I could
find all the desktop files in one list, complete with the folder where
it is located.

I understand that the desktop files are supposed to end in .desktop,
but I have lots that do not. Yet, if I delete the file, the menu entry
disappears, so the file must be a desktop entry. And when I open the
file in Gedit the name of the file in the Gedit tab is not the same as
the name in the file browser.

Application menu handling in Linux is a gawdawful mess.

Thanks, Rich!   That does indeed look like a good alternative
to the ASUS. I replaced the RAM and the hard drives in the
stock ASUS eeebox anyway (voiding the warranty), so not only
is the Jetway less expensive, it looks like a better value
for the Compleate Haquere. 

I hope you will someday share excellent stories of durability,
as well as the bizarre uses you find for the remote control. 
The Jetway website suggests these are intended as settop TV
boxes; I'm glad at least one is diverted to a higher purpose.

   Yes, they're designed for use as PDVRs. But, a computer's a computer,
particularly when you can add your own hard drive, RAM, and external optical
drive (which I had anyway and was sitting here waiting for a reason for me
to have bought it). You can fit an optical drive in the Jetway, but since we
need it only to load the OS initially and for upgrades, an external drive
works quite well.

The atom with ION vs intel graphics was a huge difference in 
responsiveness on my wife's desktop system.

I'm not thrilled with the atom CPUs in her desktop or laptop.  I haven't 
had a chance to try the latest mobile / low-power AMD CPUs (e.g. some 
thinkpad x120e), but I suspect they might have less tendency to melt 
due to mis-stated TDP and undersized fan problem that most atom CPUs 
seem to have.

I guess the question is how well "AMD Radeon HD 6310" works with Linux?  
There are a few 'booksize' machines on newegg with the E-350 and that 
chip.

It doesn't sound normal to me.

When you open Tools > Ghostery > Manager Ghostery Options and then drag 
to near the bottom, there's a section titled "Blocking Options" with 
check boxes to "Enable web bug blocking" and  "Enable cookie protection 
[experimental]" Are they checked? Under that is a list of bugs and 
cookies with check boxes. Just above the list are check boxes that, if 
checked, set the check box for all of the bugs and/or all of the 
cookies. Are these two boxes checked?

Other than those two I don't know what to tell you.

Dick,

   That's my point: I check them but the next time I log on and start
firefox, they're unchecked.

A few versions back there was an option to block everything and then you 
had to remove those that you needed.  Now it is the opposite.  You have 
to block as you go.
    It does such a good job for me that I never went further than a few 
muttered curses when it changed.

So I don't think you made any mis-configurations.

I trust you also clicked on the save button at the bottom.

Otherwise, it sounds like some other kind of problem with maintaining 
Firefox settings. But I wouldn't have a clue where to start looking for 
that.

   I've tried a handful of different terminal emulators (aterm, Eterm,
roxterm, rxvt, urxvt, wterm; 6-fingered hand here) and they all shift long
lines to the left instead of wrapping them. Ergo, something other than the
v.t. from rxvt to urxvt at that time. Since the common factor in all these
terminal emulators is the bash command line, it seems reasonable to ask what
about the command line might prevent long lines from wrapping?

   Where do I look for such knowlege? Is there a mail list or forum of bash
gurus who might have insights into this problem?

I don't recall from your earlier messages, but have you compared the
output of `env` in a terminal that behaves properly with the
miss-behaving terminal(s)? (Do you still have a terminal that wraps
properly?)

I've had issues similar to what you describe, but I never found a
solution either.  I do understand your pain though...

Rogan,

   For a while rxvt or xterm from a login shell of root or postgres would
wrap long lines, but no longer. They all shift left rather than wrap.

> I've had issues similar to what you describe, but I never found a
> solution either.  I do understand your pain though...

   This is new here. Long lines wrapped from Red Hat-4.0 through -7.3 and
Slackware-8.0 to my current -13.1. Something happened about the time I moved
from rxvt to urxvt to gain display of UTF-8 characters. I've no idea what
changed, but there must be a solution somewhere since wrapping was the
default behavior for years.

   If (when?) I resolve this I'll post the solution here.

Thanks,

Rich

   However, if I invoke zsh (with the 0 new-user option to forestall creation
of init files), a very long command line does wrap. I must have done
something to bash without realizing it.

would it be possible to have the semicolon removed from the long name of

that semicolon always confuses my mail server, and i'd guess other

hmm, if the single line of text is wrapping, that sounds like 
shell/readline helping you out.  i'm not sure where to look for options, 
but maybe it will give you another direction to check into.  if the 
entire screen is shifting, then it sounds like a horizontal scrollbar 
should be showing up, i.e. a fixed size screen with a window made 
smaller than that.

Joe,

   Long command lines shift left instead of wrapping (as they did before). I
read the readline man page this morning and learned that I need
horizontal-scroll-mode set to Off in ~/.inputrc. I had it incorrectly set to
On, but changing it to Off makes no difference (after logging out and back
in).

   Yes, it seems to be a readline or bash issue, but I don't know enough of
either to know where to look.

Thanks,

Rich

With Thunderbird, I have both "reply" and "reply list" options. If I'm 
not paying attention and click on "reply" T-bird can't send to, "General 
Linux/UNIX discussion and help; civil and on-topic 
<plug at lists.pdxlinux.org>". It has no trouble with "reply list" though.

In the "real world", is there a difference for an

I'm contemplating the move from Windows to Linux.
Coward that I am, I'm considering separate hardware as testbed.
I spend most of my time in text editing and web surfing -

My other interest include Scilab, Scioslab, and gnuplot. I 
would run and display display results of *LARGE* fft's of

Are there subtle advantages to wider data path and/or 
multiple cores?
Are there advantages to 64 bit implementations of Linux?

Thanks in advance.

Someone else (multiple someones, probably) will, and will be better able 
to, answer you question(s) in more depth, but I can advance an opinion 
on 32 vs 64 for the "average" user ... so far, none, and in some case 
the impact is negative.

The deciding factor is (still) software ... what do you want to run and 
is it available on 64 bit?  If what you want to run is not available on 
64 bit, then any advantage that the 64 might offer will be of no use to you.

As to "real world" differences for the "average/typical" user, as a 
"real world" user, I can say the list of advantages is long, but the 
learning curve can be, too.  Be not dismayed there is much help on list 
of this sort and at the meetings, too.

Good luck, and I hope you do make the switch ... when I did (finally and 
complete, back about Red Hat 9 after messing since Red Hat 5) I found my 
computing life much brighter.  There are still problems/issues around 
interfacing with people who use MS ... for example, I receive the 
occasional *.docx file ... sigh ... no matter how much I may express a 
preference.  But then my word processor (OpenOffice 2.2.1) is a bit out 
of date ... still I get by.  I like Linux a lot ... hope you do too.

Well,
Virtually any HW you will purchase 'new' today can run either 32bit or
64bit OS.
A point to consider is the number of apps you want in memory for fast
access. With a 32bit OS there is a limit of about 3.2GB of real memory that
can used. This is a addressing thing. with 64bit that number is probably
larger than most average users could afford assuming the machine is
designed for that much.  If you have say 2 or 3 apps open that don't use
tons of memory then a 32bit machine, at least from this point would be
fine. If you have several apps open that like lots of memory, that's a vote
for 64bit.  With it being very common today to run multiple OS's ( or
copies ) at the same time, if you are wanting or needing to do that then
that is a vote for 64bit.

Remember a 32bit app is a 32bit app, it doesn't magically become 64bit app
in the Intel world when installed on a 64bit OS. So unless you also get
64bit apps ( if available ) you may not see the gains you expect.

I think unless you can find a very very cheap system they will all be at
least Dual Core or better today. A single application probably won't gain
much on a dual core because they aren't written to handle multicore
environment, there are exceptions. Running several apps at once can
definitely take advantage of multiple cores.

I have been using the KDE version of Mint 9 since it came out over a year
ago, & I haven't had any of these problems with it.  Maybe the GNOME
version of Mint 9 has more bugs?

Also, I'm very careful when I burn optical disks to burn that at a slow
speed (4x), & always have the burning software check for burn errors.

I love KDE Mint 9 & look forward to using the next long term support KDE
Mint (which will probably be Mint 12).

Cheers,

Elcaset

Yes, 32-bit is easier, as not all software is built for 64-bit systems.

You can run dual-boot on one system without too much trouble. That has
been solved for about 10 years. The better Linux distributions can see
the Windows system on the hard disk and install around it, providing a
boot menu entry for it. However, if you have time you can confirm this.

No, I have a 64-bit capable AMD processor based desktop on which I run
a 32-bit version of Mandriva Linux. It does everything I need it to do.

You might install both 32-bit and 64-bit Linux systems if you have the
disk space (a decent desktop Linux system fits into 10GB or less while
hard disks are much larger now). You can use both systems to find out.

Those interests might lead you to install a 64-bit Linux system. Sure.

The wider data path imposes power and heat dissipation costs, but that
isn't a big deal, I would think, costing maybe 25W, between those two,
but I'm open to correction if anyone has better numbers to quote here.

A dual-core chip is helpful on a desktop system - or a smartphone, for
that matter - but more cores than two is really server territory, lest
you can find a game or something - like scientific processing - that's
able to use a multi-core chip. My desktop is a dual-core chip but YMMV.

> Are there advantages to 64 bit implementations of Linux?

As far as I can tell, only the larger memory and database access that
it offers. I haven't needed it, but I understand that some people do.

HTH,
Robert

Subject: [PLUG] Vmware Player Prevents Aptitude from Installing Packages
Message-ID: <CAEqej2PbrRC2nGP4BfVY+jTEsfa9Oou2KyxfMxyY_hT7QX=wdw@mail.gmail.com>

I am running a fresh install of debian wheezy. I installed VMware Player
4.0.1 build-528992 and then Windows 7 in a vm. Everything is working
properly, until I tried to use aptitude to install foomatic-db-hpijs.
VMware seems to be preventing aptitude from installing the debian packages.
The error messages:

Anyone see this before? Any ideas, short of removing VMware and then
reinstalling it, to fix this problem?

I suspect my DVD drive is the cause of the problems. It's old and has
a lot of miles on it. These things don't last forever. I have a new one
on order from Amazon, even though the current one seems to be working
fine now. It's worth the $35 I spent for the new burner. I don't like
hardware that I can't trust.

My recent dist-upgrade from Fedora 14 to 16 was a disaster, compounded
by my inability to copy a line of code faithfully. Had it not been for
Keith's sleuthing abilities at the Clinic I was seriously looking at
having to do a reinstall. Had it come to that I would have abandoned
Fedora, and my leading candidate for a replacement would have been Mint.

I have Lucid on my desktop computer because all it does is stream
radio, play videos, and serve as a fallback to get on the net in case I
mess up my laptop. Yet it continually annoys me with software updates. I
never get even two months without having to reboot, and usually I have
to log out and back in again once a month or so. Note that logging out
and back in again is as much pain as rebooting, because I have to stop
everything, close all apps, and after logging  back in again I have to
re-launch them, re-load the documents I was working on, etc. 

Fedora on my laptop is even worse, although no worse than I remember
Ubuntu from back when I ran the latest Ubuntu on it. In fact, I did the
Fedora 14 to 16 dist-upgrade a couple weeks ago and there have since
been two new kernels, the latest today. I wouldn't mind having to
install a new kernel if it is really needed because of a security
issue, but can it really be necessary to upgrade a kernel that often? 

So how often do you have to log out and back in again if you have an
LTS version of Mint? Or do you just turn off the software update
notifier and ignore updates?

Ah, yes:  ION.  If you lookup an ion benchmark, you'll see the intel 945 
scoring ~1/4 of the GeForce performance.

I'm using the nvidia-supplied just-free-beer-but-hey-it-works driver -- 
haven't tried the open source one.  Of course, the benchmarks I've seen 
were run on windows.

It looks like the open-source radeon driver might work better than the 
ati-supplied one, but I haven't had an ati card in anything for about a 
decade.

Being the 'cutting edge testbed', I'd expect Fedora to have lot's of changes, all the time. However, one must read release notes to determine if the latest changes have impact on systems one is running. e.g. If the changes are in the intel network chipset support, and one's systems has other than intel network chips, the update may in fact not apply, so therefor does not have to be installed.

Personally, I would not do that.

   Found the solution in a linuxquestions.org thread. Don't know why I didn't
look there long ago, but I didn't. Sigh.

   Someone posted a termcap entry for urxvt/rxvt-unicode that I added to the
three termcaps here (plain, -BSD, and -Linux). Slackware uses termcaps,
other distributions might, too.

   Logged out and back in and ... HOO-HA! Line wrapping is back again.

Whew!

The problem turned out to be the missing LSB in the script
vmware-USBArbitrator. I add theses lines to the script, and I was able to
install cups with no errors and run vmware.

Subject: [PLUG] NTFS on a USB flash drive?
Message-ID: <20111126231104.27fa6189@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I went to Fry's today because I needed a new mouse with blue teeth.
While there I found a Patriot brand 32 GB USB 3.0 flash drive for $20.
When I got it home and plugged it in I found that it works fine, but
Palimpsest says it is formatted NTFS.

The packaging makes much of its claimed "up to" 60 MB/s read and
25 MB/s write speed, but says nothing of operating systems. Can Macs
read NTFS? Is it wise to leave it NTFS?

Also, although I have the latest 64-bit Fedora, my computer is over
four years old, so I assume that the USB 3.0 won't do me any good until
the day comes when I get a new computer with USB 3.0 ports. Am I right
here?

Mac OSX can read NTFS but not write to it... There is a app called
MacFuse that makes writing to NTFS possible.
If you don't have USB 3.0 ports then your not going to benefit from the
speed of a USB 3.0 device and if you choose you
could format the thumbdrive and use another FS. I have USB 3.0 drives
that have USB 3.0 support and use Ext4.

I don't own any Macs, but I frequently need to work with people who do.
If their Mac can't read my flash drive that's a serious problem. Can
Macs read/write ext3 or ext4 filesystems? I think I should just
reformat it FAT32 and be done with it.

Many modern Linux distros ship with NTFS read/write functionality.
However, this is not the whole story. NTFS does not use the same
ownership and permissions model as native filesystems.  When you copy
the files back off the device onto your hard disk, you will find the
owner, group and permissions settings will have been lost. This
probably won't bother you much if you're just using the device to haul
around a few large files between machines, but if you're going to use
it as a backup or anything like that it might be an issue.

However, NTFS and FAT are at least readable by Windows, OSX and most
Linux machines, so these filesystems are very useful for transferring
stuff between OSes.  I tend to format my external media (non-flash
anyhow) with ext4 for most of the space (the primary purpose of these
drives is backups), and NTFS for transfer to and from Windows
machines.  I've also been playing with truecrypt, which is fun.  On my
main backup drive I made a small FAT partition at the start with  the
truecrypt binaries, and then split the rest of the space 60/40 between
encrypted ext4 and NTFS partitions.

(made me look)
The ever useful Wikipedia has a page comparing file systems:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems
including a chart of OS support:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems#Supporting_operating_systems
Which shows Mac OS does not support, but Mac OSX does with "NTFS-3G" which happens to link to a page describing what it is:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS-3G
Which works with the FUSE interface in OSX.

And NTFS-3G is a 2006 fork of the Linux-NTFS project.
And the Mac support was announced in late 2009.

Wireless USB mouse and keyboard combo. Keyboard
even has a battery in it, but I stole the batteries out of the mouse.
All you have to do is clean the dust off the keyboard and it will work
like new.

This mouse/keyboard combo's first owner hated it, so it needs someone
to show it love. Just pet it and feed it new batteries and it will purr
and show you love back.

If no one wants it then it goes to Free Geek.

I don't own any Macs, but I frequently need to work with people who do.
If their Mac can't read my flash drive that's a serious problem. Can
Macs read/write ext3 or ext4 filesystems? I think I should just
reformat it FAT32 and be done with it.

Not natively. I've read that you can mount ext3/4 partitions as ext2 from the command line in os/x, but I have not tried this.

Thanks to all for the thoughts. I have reformatted it FAT32. 

The only remaining question is why Patriot would have shipped the item
formatted NTFS in the first place. I have a couple of SD cards and
numerous USB flash drives, and they all came formatted FAT32. What was
Patriot thinking?

Maybe this is why I got a 32 GB USB 3.0 drive for $19.99. Lots of
customer returns = dump them.

? ? Autoconf. Automake. Libtool. This trio of build configuration

? ? In this gentle introduction to the Autotools, Scott Garman will

? ? You'll also learn about the Gnu Coding Standards and the Filesystem
? ? Hierarchy Standard, two specifications which explain a lot of the
? ? "why" behind the Autotools (yes, there is a method to this madness!).
? ? Finally, Scott will offer some practical tips for understanding

I'm in RURAL SW Missouri. A local used/surplus computer

reportedly has the majority of manufacturer's warranty.

Any comments on how suitable a Linux platform this would be?

i've had good luck with Dells and Ubuntu over three generations of Dell 
laptop and 3 yrs worth of regular Ubuntu version upgrades (through 
version 10.10, still holding off on the Gnome3/Unity thing). The Intel 
onboard video chipset (the cheaper option on many models) has good (i.e. 
, non-buggy though a bit slow) vendor-provided FOSS drivers; i've 
preferred the Nvidia dedicated video option when my employer would 
spring for it. i can't remember what model i have currently, but the 
built-in display is 1400x960 or something close to that - a little small 
for programming (i have a couple of big monitors on my desk, and use the 
standard Dell docking station to connect to those), but good enough when 
i'm on the road. Most of my employers have used these as standard 
developer laptops - reliability seems pretty good.

While I'm hesitant to discourage you from shopping locally, I wonder
if that's a good value.  This Dell Inspiron is $500, at least for today.
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834200373

OTOH, perhaps it's not fair to compare a Latitude with an Inspiron.

    411 NW Park Ave
    Suite 500
    Portland, OR 97219

Interested in giving back to your favorite distribution?  Whether you're an
experienced developer or making your first foray into the world of Open
Source, please join us for a day of community fun!


Q. What is an Ubuntu Local Jam?

A. An Ubuntu Local Jam is like an Ubuntu Global Jam:

     https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJam

   ... except not scheduled over Labor Day weekend when people are out
   of town, so more folks are able to attend!

Q. What is a Debian Bug Squashing Party?

A. A Debian Bug Squashing Party is an event where Debian developers and
   enthusiasts gather to fix bugs for an upcoming release.

     http://wiki.debian.org/BSP

More information will be available soon on ubuntu-us-or at lists.ubuntu.com
and debian-portland-soc at pdx.debian.net.

Hope to see you there!

OK, here's the plan. Unless someone pops up before the next Clinic
desperately in need of a wireless USB keyboard/mouse combo, it goes
with me to the Clinic. If you don't want it, it stays at Free Geek.
Either way, I am happy and the Earth is happy.

It might be okay but, in general, you will get a much better deal off
eBay or even Craigslist than from a local storefront with its markup.

As always, research extensively whatever machine you consider buying,
including price comparisons. Yes, add in the shipping/insurance cost.

I had too many Dell notebooks at E&Y, and those all eventually broke,
but maybe I'm biased. However I'd suggest you buy a Thinkpad instead.

YMMV,
Robert

Sounds like quite a bit to me. Do you use Craigs List? If you buy 
something right, and it doesn't work with the Linux you are wanting to 
try, you can always resell it.

Richard,

   Take a look http://www.linux-laptop.net/. It should be listed there.

A Latitude D620 runs all the Linux distros I use (CentOS, Debian, 
Fedora, Ubuntu) mostly trouble-free. The biggest sore spots, depending 
on distribution, are

  1. Wireless drivers
  2. Power management
  3. External monitors
  4. Battery life

The Latitudes can be ordered with Intel wireless cards or Dell 
wireless cards. Drivers for the Intel cards are usually solid, but the 
Dell cards are hit-and-miss, depending on the exact version you're 
getting. In general, Ubuntu is distribution that provides the most 
pain-free wireless installation, but any of them should work with a 
little elbow grease.

Power management in Linux is just not that polished when compared to, 
say, Mac OS X. I've had so-so luck getting Linux systems to reliably 
suspend or wake. The newest Fedora releases seem the best in that 
regard to me, but the bar is pretty low.

Connecting and disconnecting external monitors is more of an X11 
problem than a Latitude issue, but expect hiccups if you plan to 
do so repeatedly during a single power cycle (docking and undocking, 
or connecting to a wall projector). I can't say that any single 
distribution is better than the others in this regard, but perhaps 
someone on the list knows better.

Finally, expect to replace the Latitude's battery every 20 months or 
so. Even if you treat the battery with kid gloves and obsessively do 
full drain and recharge cycles, the battery's lifecycle will slowly 
spiral downward. It's not you. It's the computer. :-) I've had mixed 
luck with third-party manufacturers of Latitude batteries; I tend to 
buy them from Dell these days.

Thanks to various answers received I did enough research to 
find the store was not telling me everything. Browsing 
newegg.com indicates I should be able to get a NEW name 
brand similar unit for the same or lower price. Someone 
mentioned linux-laptop.net, it should give me an idea if any 
choice I make is reasonable.

Thank you.

Subject: [PLUG] System Administrator freelancers
Message-ID: <CAAF6Mjo4qH7b5_dv9es0=3D2GYFajqdk3mxGuLdLzQb9oyFNAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey fellow Linuxers,

I'm looking for system administrators who work freelance, and I wonder
whether you or anyone you know is in that boat? I regularly get
requests for deeper system administration than I really want to do, or
system administration after I'm done developing an application, and
I'd really like to have people to recommend to my clients to talk to.
Right now I'm especially looking for anyone who still knows (the
modern) RedHat.

I'm not sure how on-topic most users will consider this, so maybe a
moderator will speak up, but either way you can email me directly.

Thanks,

Jeff

A couple of further comments.

Unless you need, or really want and can afford the latest thing, you
will find a better deal by buying used. Since you want a notebook or
laptop, you should understand that they never offer the leading-edge
performance, due to the cost and power tradeoffs compared to desktop
systems, so the latest often is not that much better. Do compare the
prices and specifications of some fairly recent used machines to new
ones to see this.

Another thing to understand is that linux-laptop.net has reports for
machines that have been out long enough for Linux users to test them
with distributions available at the time. This has two implications.
First, you won't see the latest machines there for a while. Secondly
the reports on machines may not be current with the latest software.

Best wishes,
Robert
