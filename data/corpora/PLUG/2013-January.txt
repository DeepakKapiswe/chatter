   My friend wants me to install the Google Web browser on her laptop so she
can watch Flash-formatted videos. What I read on Wikipedia and other sites
leaves me confused over which is the Web browser that can be installed on a
linux system and which is the Google OS. Or, is the Web browser a layer on
linux that acts like an OS using only Google-proprietary applications like
Flashplayer?

   I find the source for chromium on the SlackBuilds.org site (184M worth)
but am having issues building it as the build script says the 212M file is
not complete. Sigh.

Happy New Year all,

Rich

   Oops! The file when downloaded is 192M, not 212M.

there's two "chrome"s, and two chromiums: one a browser, one an OS. The 
OS is generally referred to as "Chrome/Chromium OS" to help with the 
confusion.

"chromium" is the open-source core of the browser/OS, minus some 
proprietary stuff like the built-in flash plugin.

chrome download: https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/
chromium browser download: http://www.chromium.org/Home
chromium OS download: http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os

as for why chromium won't build... no idea... did you check the md5sum 
to verify the download?

Nathan,

   So installing the chromium browser won't enable viewing flash videos any
more than they can be viewed with firefox or opera?

> chrome download: https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/

   Browser or OS? :-)

> as for why chromium won't build... no idea... did you check the md5sum to

   Downloaded the source again and now it's building.

   Or, can the 11.2 version of flashplayer be found and installed in any
browser?

Thanks,

Rich

indeed. Google seems to have a habit of picking project names that are 
not very indicative of their purpose.

chromium should pick up the flashplayer like firefox does if you've got 
it installed in any of the usual locations (e.g. 
/usr/lib/adobe-flashplugin/libflashplayer.so)

Nathan,

   When I get the battery recharging on the Sony I'll look for
libflashplayer.so and check the version. There's no need for chrome/chromium
or any other heavy metal if I can get a version working in firefox.

   My understanding is that flashplayer versions newer than 11.2 will not run
in linux. Perhaps I'm mistaken on this, too.

Thanks,

Rich

   Let's forget chromium; the Sony is running firefox-15.x and
flashplayer-11.2, but cannot play flash video examples. Each site says the
latest flashplayer needs to be installed and javascript turned on.

   libflashplayer.so is in ~/.mozilla/firefox/plugins/ and /usr/lib64/ but
not being seen. Javascript is enabled in firefox.

   What am I still missing here? It should not be this difficult to get this
working for her.

Thanks,

Rich

   Could this issue with flashplayer be related to the loss of sound
capabilities when I upgraded from Slackware-13.37 to -14.0? When I try to
turn sound volume up with the panel icon (alsamixer works) a message box
pops up telling me that GStreamer cannot find any sound device. Yet,
/proc/asound/ shows the devices (they're all Intel and should be as well
supported in 14.0 as they were in prior distribution versions.

   Any and all help in resolving these two issues will be much appreciated.

To the best of my knowledge, flashplayer version 11.2.202.258 is
the last one released for Linux.  Any later versions will be
released for Windows and Mac OSX only.  (Google has an arrangement
with Adobe to allow them to build later versions of flash into
their Chrome browser.)  Whether flash will work in Firefox depends
on the site being accessed; some allow older versions of flash,
others insist on only the very latest player.

But you say that the sites you've visited require both flash and
javascript.  Do you have NoScript or something similar installed,
that blocks javascript execution?  If so, you'll need to unblock
those sites.  That may be enough to allow flash to work; at least
that's been my experience.

I too understand that this is the case.  Does anyone here have ideas

   I've not known about NoScript so I doubt it's installed. This is a
standard Slackware x86_64 upgrade and both flashplayer and sound worked in
the 13.x distributions.

   It's too bad that Adobe is taking the Microsoft route of not playing with
F/OSS OSes. What's worse, IMNSHO, is that too many of those who create
videos know only one or two proprietary tools and don't care about the rest
of us either.

Alas, I'm a Fedora boy, and don't know Slackware at all.  Heck, I
know more about Ubuntu/Debian than I do about Slackware.  But it
sounds like something in Slackware changed that screwed with your
Firefox.  Like I said, though, I don't know Slackware, and
wouldn't know where to look.  Hmm, I just did a bit of poking
around in my system, and found that libjs.so and friends are
in /usr/lib64.  They're provided (in Fedora) by the package
js-1.8.5-9.fc17.x86_64.rpm.  I know this is going to sound silly, 
but similar things have happened:  Do you have javascript
installed?  If it isn't, that would certainly account for your
problems.  (It *should* be installed by default when you
installed Firefox, but packaging mistakes do happen.)

I consider NoScript and Adblock+ to be essential accessories to
Firefox.  They block ads (obviously), and block all sorts of
malware scripts.  Both of them are well worth the few minutes it
takes to download and install them.  I also like ForcastFox, but
that's not really an essential.  I just like having the weather
report on my FF menu bar.  :-)

It's no great surprise.  Heck, Adobe's support for their own
low-or-no-cost software is generally not very good, even for the
Windows versions.  (I've used some of Adobe's Win32 software.
I'll stick with Linux and F/OSS tools, thank you very much.)  So
I'm not surprised that when the economy tanked, they dropped Linux
support.  Especially given that the world is slowly moving to
HTML5, and leaving flash behind.

Dale,

   I'll check with slackware-centric folks when the holiday is over and more

   I run adblock and ghostery. I keep a firefox tab open to www.wunderground.com
because they have a reporting station about a mile east of me. I check that
sporatically during the day to see if wet weather is heading in (or out) of
the area and learn the local temperature and wind speed.

   Right. Forgot about that. So bit-by-bit (pun intended) the issue should
slowly go away.

I've generally had good luck with Tyan motherboards in terms of
Linux compatibility and stability.  Most of their boards are
server-oriented, which seems to be what you need.

Sounds like you're looking for a server.  It's been a few years since
I was in the market for a motherboard, but Tyan made some nice
server-oriented boards.  Multiple (multi-core) CPUs, lots of (ECC)
RAM; multiple SATA connections, USB, serial, parallel, and Ethernet
ports, and optional SCSI bus(ses).  Solid construction, and worked
well with Linux.

To get conclusive information on whether or not the FF browser has the
flash plugin installed you type the command [about:plugins] in the FF URL
bar.

Enabled plugins
Find more information about browser plugins at
mozilla.org<https://pfs.mozilla.org/plugins/>.

Find updates for installed plugins at
mozilla.com/plugincheck<http://www.mozilla.com/plugincheck/>.

Help for installing plugins is available from plugindoc.mozdev.org.

My experience with Debian is often times things get moved around and file
links get broken. If FF doesn't report flash being installed and enabled. I
would just walk through the flash install process for whatever Slackware
version you're running. Here's a couple of good links I found for doing
that. They all have pointers to the slackbuilds and such.

http://www.basicconfig.com/install_adobe_flash_player_slackware_linux

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/ive-screwed-up-installing-flash-player-4175433956/

I wish I knew more about Slackware. Maybe in 2013 I'll make a concerted
effort to run it and learn it.

Hope this is helpful.

Cheers!,

Mike

I'm running Firefox 10.0.11 ESR under 64-bit Mageia now, but used to
have Firefox 15 and here's how I had flashplayer set up to work then.

In your /home/[usrid] directory you'll have ./.mozilla/firefox and...
under that you'll have a [random].default directory where all firefox
user files live.

Create /home/[userid]/.mozilla/firefox/[random].default/plugins and a
soft link in that: libflashplayer.so -> /usr/lib64/libflashplayer.so .

That worked for me, but as always YMMV.

Subject: [PLUG] Web design software?
Message-ID: <20130101203639.2936fe93@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I am considering creating a simple web site where people can trade
supplies needed for sleep apnea equipment. (Supplies do not require a
prescription.) This will be a labor of love pro bono. I expect I may
have to pay out of pocket for the domain, but hopefully that can be
minimized.

More importantly, I need to create the web site, and I know zero about
HTML and web site design. However, what I have in mind will be
extremely simple. Shopping carts and such are not needed because I will
not be selling anything. However, I will require some way for people to
post what they have, with an automatic deletion after a time. I am
thinking of a template that they fill out in order to post something.
Think of the page you fill out to post something on eBay, except vastly
simpler. 

I also need some way for people to communicate with a poster via
concealed e-mail address. And probably a subscriber/member list with
verification, lest the site get spammed.

And there are probably other things that I haven't thought of. Did I
say that I knew nothing of web design?

Suggestions?

There are two suggestions that i have. First, spend some time finding and
talking to potential customers. Try to find fifty that care enough about
this that you can do the work by hand. Prove that there is a market. While
you are doing  customer discovery interviews, build your social medial
muscles and build out a network of people who care about sleep apnea.

As you do that, find a co5ntent management tool, like google sites,
wordpress or drupal to build out content.

Everything you talked about is doable at some level by content management
tools

   I've had excellent advice and products from ENU, Inc. on NE 122nd Ave.
They know what works well with linux, are reasonably priced, and work with

   Wordpress, as I've been told, is quite simple. CMS Made Simple is more
complicated but also more capable and expandable. It also has a solid user
community on Web fora. Lotsa' choices, John. And don't forget security and
maintainability as you evaluate choices and tools.

I recommend boards *without* electrolytic capacitors.  In my experience
those have been the parts that are most prone to fail.  Reference
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_plague.  Asus and Gigabyte
manufacture such boards, though I don't know if *all* their boards meet that
threshold.  I usually have to resort to examining a picture of the board to
determine whether electrolytics are being used.  They're pretty obvious,
taller than most components, and typically black with a blue stripe on them,
and silver on top.  (Galen or Keith can correct me on that.)

More generally, I've never had a problem with any general purpose board and
Linux.

Is this still an issue? I remember about 10 years ago when China dumped a bunch of incorrectly copied caps on the market, and we all paid for it about 2 to 4 years later, but I thought the issue was well documented, and put behind us. I thought, mostly prior to 2007. 

Electrolytic caps have been in production for over 75 years. The bad caps were made using inferior and incorrect components and chemicals. 

The fact remains that electrolytic caps are very good electronic noise filters, and I would bet that nearly every power supply in all of our houses and data centers employs them.

Domains are $10/yr or less - consider a .org or .us from Joker, Gandi or
(bleurgh) GoDaddy.

It sounds like you're looking for a forum/bulletin-board/message-board
system.  There are lots out there.  phpBB is very popular.

If you don't want to play sysadmin, a Google for "forum hosting" turns up
lots of free ad-supported services.

You might also consider using Google/Yahoo Groups.

Your biggest cost will be time - promoting your forum (and buying
AdWords?), analytics, policing bad behaviour and spam, ensuring there's
backups, distinguishing butthurt from actual anjury.

It's a good an noble thing to do,
  Aaron

I will bow to those more knowledgeable than I regarding the current status
of electrolytic capacitors.  I understand that even good electrolytic
capacitors degrade with normal use - but that might just be misinformation.
Somebody please set me straight if I'm wrong about that.

The two things I do know in this regards are: 
1) Well respected brands of motherboards are available that don't use
electrolytics; 
2) Since I started avoiding boards with electrolytic capacitors, I haven't
had a board fail.  

Given that, I choose to avoid electrolytic capacitors when I can.

In the next couple of months I hope to be building an Intel i7 system with
an Intel DX79SR motherboard.  It has SATA plugs for 6 drives and holds up
to 64gigs of ram.

If anything is Linux compatible, that should be.  (And if it isn't, it
soon will be.)

If you're interested in water cooled mother boards and want to see what 
one looks like up close, the folks at NWCA

http://www.nwca.com/

have a box set up in their showroom. I've gone to them for cables and, 
last year, a video card. It looks like they support gamers.

The box they have looks like a typical tower with the exception of being 
much larger.

I think they used to be in inner southeast Portland but a good number of 
years ago they moved out to Clackamas. That makes the convenient for me.

My new Asus DVD burner arrived. After I installed it I found that there 
must be an internal speaker in the Gateway box I got from Free Geek a 
number of weeks ago. For some reason sound no longer plays through the 
external speakers. All I can think of is that I must have bumped some 
cable while connecting power and data cables to the new SATA drive. I'm 
shortly going to open the box and have a look, but if anyone knows of 
some other probable cause, I'd love to hear about it.

No. I thought of that -- because that one's bitten me before -- and I 
checked. The sound is not muted.

I can hear sound coming from somewhere in the tower, which is rather 
weird because I don't see a speaker anywhere. I have the tower standing 
on a plywood riser under the desk. The speakers are sitting on top of 
the desk. The sound is definitely coming from the tower. Adjusting the 
volume control on the speakers only generates a bit of static from the 
speakers.

Thanks for all the suggestions from everyone.

	* 	Plone would take me several months of study to learn
		how to use it. Bear in mind that I don't even know what
		"HTML" stands for.

	*	I created a free Wordpress page, but it appears
		designed for blogs. A blog is not what I need.

While poking around some of my ideas for the site are starting to gel.
Here is what I want:

A site where people must sign up with e-mail validation. This is pretty
standard for web sites these days.

Upon signing up they automatically get 10 "site credits." These can be
used like money to buy things that people have posted on the site. When
a user posts an item on the site the user states how many site credits
he wants for it, and if someone pays him this amount the poster is then
required to ship the item to the "buyer" at the poster's expense. You
can get more site credits by posting things of your own that you no
longer need so that others can benefit from them. The idea is that a
new user can get one item free, but in order to buy more things the user
has to reciprocate by posting things for others to "buy."

To post an item you must fill out an information sheet, which will
include a required photo, location, etc. The purpose is to ensure that
posters include adequate information. Postings automatically expire in
seven days, or immediately when someone "buys" it.

All communication is via the users' e-mail addresses. 

Note that no money changes hands on the site. Nothing is for sale. All
site credits are in the user profile. There is no need for shopping
carts, PayPal, credit cards, etc. 

Initially I will have to administer the site to remove inappropriate
postings and ban users who fail to follow the rules. Ultimately I will
find a trusted user or two to share the duties.

I doubt I will have more than a couple hundred users or more than a few
dozen site visits per day. 

I don't think I need to worry about spam because no one can post
anything except registered users, and they must do so by filling out
the template. As for security, the main issues are the user accounts and
the database of listings. I could imagine a hacker setting up a user
account, then hacking the site to give himself lots of free site
credits, but all he could do with them is "buy" used sleep apnea parts.
There is no money here. The best security is not to be an attractive
target in the first place.

I'm sure I'll think of more things as I proceed, but that's the basic
framework for what I have in mind.

Joker, Gandi and GoDaddy look like possibilities for getting the domain
and hosting for a nominal amount. But I still need something
pointy-clicky that I can use to create the content.

   Or, you could set it outside my house in Troutdale. With 17-21 mph winds
and still temperature at 33F it will stay nice and cool.

I opened up the box, checked the connectors that plug into the front 
panel, stared at the mother board block that houses the audio jacks on 
the rear panel, muttered at it all, looked for but did not see any 
internal speaker(s), closed the box and powered back up. This time I 
plugged the external speakers into the front headphone jack. I have 
Ubuntu 12.04 on this machine. I did not hear the African sounding music 
I usually hear when I log in.

I started up Rhythmbox and tried playing an audio file. Rhythmbox crashed.

I opened the same audio file with Audacity. It played correctly through 
the external speakers. I moved the speaker plug to the rear jack and 
played the same file, again. No sound from the external speakers -- I 
picked one up and held it to my ear -- but there was definitely correct 
sound coming from under the table. Very strange. I moved the plug back 
to the front jack, played the file again, and the sound comes from the 
external speakers.

Any other thoughts?

John,

It sounds as if you want advice on how to build a custom online
marketplace/auction (like ubid, or amazon). At this point, we have offered
several suggestions. IMO, you have three options. One, hire someone to
build the site for you., Two, learn how to do it yourself. This option may
take longer, but may be more satisfying. Three, change your requirements to
fit into the offerings of point and click solutions like wordpress or
drupal or plone or.... I don't think you will find a point and click site
builder that has a full blown marketplace with private currency out of the
box.

For the last two options, you will, as a minimal effort, have to create a
logo and visual appearance of your site and that will require (1) knowledge
of graphics and design, (2) knowledge of the tool you choose to use to
build the site so you can add your logo, fonts, colors, images etc. to the
stock site and (3) some knowledge of the underlying tools your tool is
built upon (HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.) to make the changes to customize
your site.

Finally, I agree with John Sechrest's post: before you build anything, find
out what your target consumers want - it usually is very different than
what you think they want. You can kill two birds with one stone...while
doing your market research, start learning how to use the tools you will
need to build your site.

Good Luck!

Mark

Excellent.  Sometimes it takes a bit of tinkering to work that stuff out,
and you have some good detailed ideas there.

Your overall concept sounds a lot like a messageboard (think Craigslist),
and I think your credit system could be built as an addon to one of the
standard messageboards.

Here's a discussion of something similar:
https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=72&t=2095939

Meantime, as a trial, you could set up a messageboard somewhere on a free
service (or borrow a piece of someone's DreamHost account*) and keep track
of credits by hand.  That would let you test the concept before you commit
to spending $200-$1,000 on a custom addon.

*I have one BTW...

So you want to create an economy?  It'll be interesting to see how 
people "game" your system. For example, if there is a limited number of 
credits, say at most, 2000 (200 users starting with 10 each) what's 
going to stop someone from carefully "buying up"  all the credits, 
driving up the value and thus being  a significant and unpredictable 
influence on the system? Or worse, since it's not imperative to be a 
part of this economy, what do you do when people run out of credits and 
have to trade more and more valuable things to keep in the game, they 
just abandon their membership? It'll be fun to watch any rate!

Open up your box again, only this time boot it up and try playing
some music.  Use a cardboard tube (say, from a roll of waxed
paper) to one ear to determine where the "phantom" sound is coming
from.  I've used this technique to find the source of odd sounds
before -- it's surprising how well it works.  I'd be willing to
bet that there's some odd, non-speaker-looking component on the
motherboard that's acting as the speaker.

As for the rear sound connectors, since everything worked before
you installed your new DVD, it's most likely a loose connection.
Try wiggling and pushing on the cable connectors while you're
playing music.  Double check the connections to make sure that one
of the cables isn't plugged in wrong (i.e., offset by one, turned
around backwards).

Hope this helps.

The speakers work, the sound card works, it still sounds like some mixer
settings got changed because you added a CD/DVD to the system.  On my
system the sound that comes out of the rear speaker jack is controlled by a
mixer control labeled "Front"  and the sound that  comes out the front is
controlled by "headphone".   Do you still hear sound from the tower when
the external speakers are totally unplugged from the system?

No, that's Bitcoin. :)

Everyone gets ten credits to start with. Every time someone posts an
item they will get a few additional credits just for posting the item.
So the number of credits will increase with the traffic. I could also
grant credits to someone for exemplary service to the site, e.g., when
and if I find someone trustworthy to share administrative duties.

As for "buying up" the credits, that is not possible because credits
cannot be redeemed for cash or bought with cash. They are valuable only
on the little world of the site. 

Initially I was just going to have people post things and make private
arrangements with buyers via e-mail. And I may decide ultimately that
my credit idea was not as good as I originally thought. 

I was trying to conceive of a way that a new user can get one or two
items free, but then has to start reciprocating by posting his or her
own things in order to continue getting stuff. At the same time I was
trying to avoid cash. Once there is cash on a site it becomes a target
for fraud, and the site operator personally becomes a target for
government agencies, who have a talent for smelling a revenue source.

I haven't settled on a name for the site, except that I want it to
contain the word "exchange." That is the spirit that I want to create.

Maybe if your site stays small it won't attract the attention of the 
IRS. But they already intend to have their fingers in the pot via the 
concept of bartering. See:

Mineral oil has a specific heat of ~.4, water, 1.0. So you would have to 
have 2.5 times as much mineral oil to accept the same amount of heat and 
with the same rise of temperature.

This sounds somewhat like freecycle (www.freecycle.org), with complication thrown in.

The difference I've seen in mineral oil cooling is that the whole PC is submerged, not just a small radiator on the heat generating components filled with water. At that point, you have many times as much oil as you would ever have water.

I have long known that the IRS considers bartering for gain the same as
earned income. But the site owner (me) is not doing the bartering.
Exchanges are user to user transactions. An individual user might be
subject to taxes, but I am not in the loop.

However, in looking at the regulations I may be required to file 1099-B
forms to all the users, with copies to the IRS. There is an exemption
for noncommercial exchanges, but the language is not as clear as it
could be:

"The term [barter exchange] does not include arrangements that provide
solely for the informal exchange of similar services on a noncommercial
basis."

I note that eBay and Craigslist do not send out 1099 forms to their
sellers, and many of their sellers are seriously commercial.

Also, since the site credits cannot be converted to cash, there is no
cash equivalence to report. The language of the regulations refers only
to barter exchange sites where the site holds unexchanged "dollars." If
I had to file 1099 forms for the users, all the forms would show zero
figures. 

It was good of you to bring this up. I think I am not going to worry
about it. However, it does make me think that I had better make sure
that the word "non'commercial" appears everywhere on the site.

Unless the oil is circulating, specific heat won't matter once the 
system comes to a steady state.  With the system immersed, the driving 
factors would be the heat conductivity and surface areas of the 
components and heat sink.  Whereas, with circulating water, you are 
concerned with specific heat and flow rate.  It all just reduces to heat 
transfer, but how you calculate it is apples to oranges (and persimmons 
in the case of the still air insulating around every un-piped thing in 
an exclusively water-cooled case.)  I'm thinking we should skip this 
debate and move on to electrically non-conducting (and maybe non-
flammable) refrigerants.  Just spray the liquid across the components 
and allow the phase-change to take the heat away. :-)

As it is. In some cases, they just submerge the components in an aquarium, run an aerator in it to cause circulation, and let it go. Here's an article: http://www.geek.com/articles/geek-cetera/cool-your-pc-by-submerging-it-in-oil-20120612/

That looks like what I want. The only problem is that I don't have time

Mr. Google came up with this:

I poked around in the demo a bit. It looks like I might be able to get

Are you asking "wrong question" in "wrong forum"?

Interesting technique. It might have been more effective if there 
weren't so many big shiny fins all over the place.

Actually, the closest I've come to finding what sounds like a real 
speaker is that with the cover off, and using the cardboard tube, the 
sound seems to be coming from "under" the motherboard. That would be on 
one of the sides of the tower. It looks like there's room for a modest 
speaker in there. There are too many other things I'd likely mess up if 
I were required to find the culprit, so I'm just going to sigh and say, 
"Hey. I've got a speaker inside my computer."

Checked wire that went from someplace to someplace else, where I could 
find at least one end. Every connector I found was seated firmly. The 
only connectors I messed with when I installed the new DVD drive were 
the old ISA cable from the old drive, and the power connector from that 
drive, and the new SATA data cable and the Molex to SATA style power 
cables.

I downloaded and installed QasMixer and the Gnome ALSA Mixer. I ran them 
one at a time and found that they essentially show the same thing -- as 
one would expect.

QasMixer shows me that I have Headphone, Speaker 0, Speaker 1, PCM, 
Center, and LFE for output "channels". Headphone, Speaker 1, and PCM 
show the faders at max, and each (except for PCM) has a dark circle 
(called "Playback Switch") below them. Speaker 0's Playback Switch is a 
light circle, and its fader is at minimum. I tried plugging the external 
speakers into the rear jack and playing with the Playback Switch and 
fader for Speaker 0 with no effect. If I turn off Speaker 1 with the 
Playback Switch while the speakers are plugged into the front jack, the 
sound is muted.

As part of my investigation I looked at the BIOS settings and found:

System Setup
Advanced
Peripheral Configuration
Audio
     High Definition Front Panel Audio <ENABLE>

I don't know if that has an particular significance in this situation, 
but I include the observation for completeness.

The system works well with the speakers plugged into the front jack, so 
I'll probably leave it at that for now.

isn't there supposed to be a cable from the audio out on the drive to
the sound card or, if using sound on the motherboard, to the
motherboard?

In my experience connecting the sound cable to the drive is not a
problem, but getting the other end placed correctly on the sound card
or motherboard pins is sometimes tricky. 

But maybe SATA drives carry the sound signal in the SATA data cable?
Somehow that sound signal has to get to the sound card or motherboard.
But I've never used a SATA optical drive, so I don't know how they
might be different.

Wait, you said you had sound out the front speaker jacks. Then the
signal must be getting from the drive to the sound chip. I'll shut up
now.

Heh, yeah, all those finny things can get in the way.

But this leads me to wonder if Bill Barry isn't on the right
track.  If it's not a cable problem, perhaps it's software.  As
you said, you've probably got a speaker hidden on the blind side
of the case.  It's probably connected to the "beep" channel of
your sound chip.  Could it be that your main rear channels have
somehow been redirected to the beep channel?  I'm just guessing
here, but it can't hurt to check.

Not sure where the fastest download site is at any given moment,
because that seems to vary with site load over time.   However,
a general rule of thumb is to pick a short path to a site with
lots of bandwidth.

"Short path" on the internet is more dependent on who your ISP
is than anything else.  Most ISPs around Portland connect to the
rest of the Internet (and each other) through routers in Seattle.
So ping time between my house on Frontier FIOS to another Frontier
FIOS customer in Washington County is typically under a millisecond,
and at 15Mbps I can move an 800 megabyte distro image in about
eight minutes.  To Portland State or Oregon State, even though
they have very fat pipes, it is slower.

You can use the program "traceroute" to see the path your packets
take to any given destination.  For example, the packets from my
house to my outside server in Dallas TX route through Beaverton
to Seattle, then San Jose, then Los Angeles, then Dallas, with
a few scattering through Houston.  Packets to PSU or OSU bounce
through Seattle as well.  Your mileage is guaranteed to vary.
Sometimes traceroute doesn't work right, but ping (for end to
end measurements) almost always does.

That said, I usually use Oregon State Open Source Labs for
downloads.  Not as much because they are always the fastest,
but because they have a heck of a lot of bandwidth, and they
mirror almost everything they aren't the main hosting site for..
The cost to them (and us the taxpayers) is very low, because
they are sitting on huge fiber resources they got in some clever
right-of-way negotiations with the big carriers (much of the
trans-Pacific fiber traffic passes through OSU land).  And I
trust them to know what they are doing.

I remember that cable from my first CD-ROM drive. IIRC it carried a 
signal from the drive to the sound hardware so that one could play a 
music CD without much intervention on the part of the rest of the 
computer. I haven't seen one in use for a number of years.

If so, then I would expect it would be part of the mother board printed 
wiring.

Actually, I haven't tried listening to a CD or DVD through the new 
drive, yet.
But, more discoveries have been made. Stand by for my reply to Dale's post.

I've usually had the best luck with the OSU mirror at
http://ubuntu.osuosl.org/ ; if I remember the specs correctly, they have
a 2GB pipe (PSU I think only uses a 100MB pipe). In other words, they've
got the closest big pipe available. 

While the other comments on torrents are true, that can generally be
addressed by checking the MD5SUM or SHA1SUM key for the download.

Thanks,

I ran lshw to see if I could get some more info on the box. One of the 
things it showed me was the Gateway model number of the machine. I'll 
put some of the output of lshw at the end of this post. Looking up the 
product on the Gateway support site turned up this interesting page:

http://support.gateway.com/s/CASES/shared/8011316/8011316mvr2.shtml

The internal speaker is not under the motherboard, but is located in the 
fan housing that directs air across the processor heat sink -- one of 
those big shiny fin things.

Another thing I got from that site was the user guide. It describes the 
functions of the five audio jacks, three on the back and two on the 
front of the box. The three on the back are, blue: Audio in/side speaker 
jack; green: Headphone/front speaker jack; red: Microphone jack. The two 
on the front are, green: Headphone jack; red: Microphone jack. The user 
guide explains that, "The five jacks can be used for more than one 
purpose. For example, the blue jack on the computer can be a stereo in 
jack or a stereo out jack." It also tells how to configure the five 
jacks, using the Windows control panel or the Realtek Sound Effect 
Manager, if it is installed.

So, now I need to find out if someone has created a Linux tool for 
configuring those jacks. They are part of the Intel D945GPB motherboard, 
so I would imagine someone might have worked something up for that.

Here are a few of the interesting things lshw showed me:

And if your download has an incorrect sum, use rsync to fix the error(s) 
in your download.  This should be much faster than repeating the download.

http://spectrum.ieee.org/podcast/computing/software/computers-its-time-to-start-over

Interesting interview of Dr. Robert Watson of Cambridge ( and on
the board of the FreeBSD Foundation) about the rearchitecting of
computer hardware.  To a chip designer, Dr. Watson's
prognostications seem like small steps in the right direction. 

The way things are headed, vast swaths of software is being
replaced with special purpose hardware.  As the relative cost of
a logic gate plummets compared to the time and energy cost of an
instruction fetch, it is far more cost effective to add graphics
and radio and network-layer hardware to chips, even if most of
that hardware isn't ever used in a particular user device. 

For example, Intel's latest "single chip processor" for mobile
devices has 6 radios on it, even though a particular device may
use only one or two.  On-chip radios are far cheaper than the
wires and board-space and power needed to connect to optimized
separate-chip radios.  Will they become obsolete?  You betcha. 
But you will buy a new device for its new features sooner. 
The main thing you should demand is the ability to securely
and freely transfer your data and capabilities to each new
device without hassle.  Open platforms, open standards!

In time, I expect software will balkanize into a lot of little
modules, running in separate hardware sandboxes, with interprocess
communication completely managed by hardware.  Software kernels
as we know them may vanish.  Bugs will remain in the design 
process, corrected over time, and exploits will only endure
until next year's hardware release.

We may be adding a credit card reader for my wife's office. 
We will only need to do a couple of transactions a day, 
but during a hectic workday so speed and ease of use are
still important.  Verifone has some ethernet based gear,
OS independent, and we can put that on the LAN inside the

Suggestions?

If you only do a few transactions how about just using smart 
phone/tablet? We use: https://squareup.com/

Reader is free, iOS or Android, low fees, easy to use, take transactions 
anytime, anywhere.  Signature, and email receipts, download transactions 
to various software.  Highly recommended.

There is also: 
http://payments.intuit.com/merchant-services/mobile-credit-card-processing-234NS-3439G6.html

although I have not personally used that on.

What I like about these "out of the box thinking" services, is the fact 
that the fees are low, there is no expensive hardware or software 
required, and they are easy to use.

Thanks to Rich's post in Plug-talk, I had a closer look at the cpu

bit processor before this morning. Since it's intended as a test

Any gotchas I should be watching out for?

Well, I'm afraid it's time to pull the plug. I have the financial
resources for hosting and domain registration, but I completely lack
any knowledge of how to create the content. I have done quite a bit of
googling on possible solutions, but there are no ready-to-use options.
Classes are starting next week at PSU and I don't have time to become a
web developer, especially just for one site. Hiring someone is an
option, but sounds very expen$ive. The site would be not for profit, so
there would be no revenue to pay someone from.

So for now this idea is dead. I want to thank everyone for the input.
You gave me a lot of things to think about and helped me form a clearer
idea of what kind of site would be needed to serve the many people who
would make use of it.

I've had problems with flash on 64-bit including needing to disable the 
displaying of the slideshow of features during the install on a machine

Hi Rich,

http://html5readiness.com/  shows the current (or at least, pretty recent)
status of various browsers support for the various aspects of HTML5 and
CSS3.

Generally speaking, they all support a large portion.  Chrome is often
ahead of everyone else, but for most things, any recent browser will work
these days.

WebGL is still horribly unreliable, at least on Linux, and a few other
things haven't seen much work yet, but they're pretty esoteric.

Rogan,

   Thank you. The other side of the equation is how many general interest Web
sites have transitioned to HTML5 and CSS3 to distribute videos. As the sign

   Thanks, Mike! I keep forgetting about the about: command.

   Turns out there are plugins for M$ media, mplayer, quicktime, google vlc,
and realplayer, but no flashplayer. Sigh.

   I should have thought of a Web search. On my other hosts flashplayer
installation has not been an issue, but they're not yet running -14.0.

Robert,

   No plugins subdirectory there. But, the linuxquestions thread initmated
that placing the shared library in /usr/lib (rather than /usr/lib64) works.
I copied the .so to /usr/lib/ and we'll see if that does the trick.

Thinkpads fascinate me, so I spent way too much time researching.

I don't have an X1, but I wonder what is missing, being that thin.
CD/DVD drive and VGA connector, obviously, though these can be
brought along (and lost) as dongles when needed.   How long does
the charge last if doing CPU intensive stuff, like compilation?
Sometimes low power means that some behaviors, like playing videos
and listening to music, are power frugal, but CPU intensive stuff
like computation and encryption drain the battery fast.

The specs are here:
http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/tech-specs/laptop/thinkpad/x-series/x1-carbon/

Integrated Intel video.  Probably good, with usable open source
drivers, but you need more information on external monitor and
projector resolution support.  Intel sometimes fails at this.

The hardware maintenance manual is here:
http://download.lenovo.com/ibmdl/pub/pc/pccbbs/mobiles_pdf/x1_carbon_hmm_en_0b48811_02.pdf

It looks like the battery is accessable by removing the keyboard,
so that can be replaced, yay!  Ditto for the SSD, though it looks
quite nonstandard.   However, the screws are nylon coated and
"use once and replace", so you will need to purchase replacement
screws before you open it up.  As a committed warranty voider,
that would be troublesome for me - I always look inside.

Lenovo still provides the HMM, so that is a big plus.  Many of
the connectors are on accessable "mini-sub-cards", so if one
breaks or wears out, you don't need to replace the whole main
board.  However, the RAM is soldered in.  Great for reliability,
lousy for upgradability.

There is no mention of the X1 Carbon on http://www.thinkwiki.org/
That is the go-to community for all things Thinkpad and Linux. 
No mention on http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/lenovo.html
That is less well maintained.

A review claiming Ubuntu 12.04 compatability, low brightness, and
3.5 hour battery life: http://www.amazon.com/review/R242N9HGY01ZIC

Here's dmesg output: https://gist.github.com/3934585

The actual laptop is small, but the bundle of things you need to
bring along for charging, DVDs, presentations, etc. is big.  My
ancient T60 is a heavy monster, but everything I need (except the
AC adapter) is built in, and I get 6 hour battery life if I carry
two spares.  That gets me across the country.

So ... this looks like the usual perils of early adoption. 
I would wait for other folks to evaluate it and find the bugs
and endure the recalls before I took the risk.

Wow, Portland is happening!

A bit further north we have the Cascadia IT Conference, March 15 & 16 in
Seattle. Coincidentally we are 1 day away from the submission deadline for
tutorials, and not long before the submission deadline for talks & panels.

http://casitconf.org/casitconf13/cfp/


 And let's not forget LinuxFest Northwest in Bellingham, April 27 & 28 even
further north in Bellingham. Coincidentally, their call for presentations
is also currently open (despite the title, I don't believe a paper is
required).

Thanks for the reply, Keith. It turns out that like you I also ended up 
changing my mind about getting one as I did more research.

The main reason is that I found the T430S (note the 'S') which is only a 
pound more, but doesn't require dongles, has a DVD-R drive I can remove 
and put in another HD if I want, still has the same high-res screen and 
great keyboard, and is significantly cheaper, too.

The disk space issue is a big one - the X1 Carbon maxes out at 256 GB 
SSD, which just isn't quite big enough for my needs. Being able to fit a 
standard sized laptop hard drive in the thing creates a lot of flexibility.

Only that if you to run 32-bit software (steam, skype, for example) , 
you will need to install the 32-bit compatibility libraries. Otherwise, 
you shouldn't notice any differences.  Depending on how much RAM you 
have and what apps you run, 64-bit can be a bit faster for some tasks.

Thanks Larry!

I assume you are talking about the block erase problem described here:

http://www.anandtech.com/show/2738/8

Which I interpret as "reading is very fast, writing on erased
flash blocks is fast, erasing a portion of a block is slow
because you have to move pages of data around to do it". 

This is a "feature" of the physical architecture of NAND flash, 
where the bits can be very small but the block erase mechanism
is large, so they pile a whole bunch of bits into a block to
reduce cost, power, and initial read/write time.  Unlike a 
hard disk, writing "1s" into an SSD is very fast, but writing
"0s" is done in large bunches, and is slow. 

This also wears out the flash memory, though new rapid pulse
heating techniques are claimed to fix this ( I suspect they 
will also break wires on the chip ).


The following discusses the best linux filesystem with SSD:

http://superuser.com/questions/228657/which-linux-filesystem-works-best-with-ssd

This thread suggests using ext4 with TRIM.  That shows up in
the 2.6.33 kernel (I'm using an RHEL6 kernel with 2.6.32, sigh). 
It also suggests no swap on the SSD, and turning off some of the
access flags on the filesystem.

This is an 8x5 office.   We could schedule a "defragmentation"
process in the wee hours after backups,  without degrading
performance.  Are there tools for that?

Also, it would be nice if there was a module that could be added
to the kernel for evaluating current disk usage with our particular
set of tasks, estimating compatibility with SSD.  Suggestions?

BTW, I have been running two ALIX single board computers as 
firewalls for years, with compact flash card "disks".  They
work fine, though they send syslog information to other machines
and don't write much to their own disk - about 40 files per day.

ext4 on RHEL6 supports TRIM via the 'discard' mount option:

Red Hat frequently backports selective features from kernels released after

The mudslinging in the replies is more interesting.  Here's
my bit of wet brown prolixity:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Expanding the landscape
 
40 years ago, computing meant IBM and DEC.  Now it means Windows,
games consoles and POSIX/Open (Unix, BSD, Linux, Apache, embedded,
 ...).  Windows still dominates its niche, but that niche is an
ever-smaller part of a rapidly diversifying computing landscape.
Microsoft needs huge revenue to survive.  Even if Linux and BSD and
all their many variants are smaller in total size (they aren't), they
are starving the giants by reducing both market share and margins.

Microsoft can make lucrative marketing deals and produce "vending
machine" OSes like Windows 8, but the web is flat, and those deals
will only last as long as Microsoft's partners lack the skills to
reach their customers directly without sending money to Redmond.

Linux is a platform, a way of doing business, a way to add a little
frosting on top and deliver a whole cake.  For the 90% of companies
that are not software or content, it can be a less expensive, lower
risk, and more agile way to achieve business goals.

Granted, there is much to learn before the open software approach
is best for everyone, but the learning accumulates as the number of
interactions (the square of the number of participants) in an open
system, while it accumulates as the logarithm of the number of
participants in a hierarchical system.  Metcalfe's law.

Google and IBM(!) may be the most public faces of free and open source
software, but the real strength is the range of sizes the platform
permits.  I'm an electrical engineer, not a programmer, but I have
found small bugs and patched my own kernel, and much better programmers
than I have improved those patches and shared them with the world.
Very small companies can rapidly become very big companies (like
Google), and very big companies can rapidly become very different big
companies (like IBM).  Small companies can focus on tiny market niches
(small office medical informatics, for example) and provide services
and create worldwide communities of fanatically loyal customers.
As long as you can abide by "potluck rules" - take something,
bring something - you can take a lot more than you bring, given
the multiplying effect of the web and the easy customization of
open systems.  Million dollar problems become ten thousand dollar
problems.  Four person shops can serve a half a million users.

So the big surprise is that in spite of optimizing to serve niche
markets, Linux-based Chrome enables a product that can win in a
traditionally "big software" niche like consumer notebooks.  In time,

Subject: [PLUG] Laptop keyboards, new or used
Message-ID: <20130108001527.GD28028@gate.kl-ic.com>

My wife broke a key on her Thinkpad T30 laptop, and I had
to cannibalize another working T30 to replace it.  Normally,
my go-to place for keyboards is EcoBinary in Beaverton (they
have about 50 used ones for $12 each) but they are currently
out of T30 keyboards.  I imagine they will get some eventually.
I cherry-picked and stockpiled two keyboards in pretty good
shape for my T60s.

The Free Geek store sells a few parts-only machines, but I've
never seen anything as "new" as a T30.  There may be plenty of
parts in the reclaim bins in back.  eBay sometimes has used
keyboards, but I don't trust used keyboards I can't inspect.

And there are some web outfits that offer new keyboards for
old laptops for around $40, but they resemble the fraudsters
described on ripoffreports.  The few reputable parts dealers
I have previously purchased from are out of T30 keyboards.

08K4670 (NMB) or 08K4699 (ALPS) are the part numbers.

So ... 

Are there other places in town that sell used laptop keyboards
over the counter?  Does anyone have a broken T30 with a good
keyboard?  Any reputable online stores that sell new keyboards
for ancient laptops?

I bought one of those, from Amazon.  It doesn't feel much like any Linux
distro I've ever used, but I guess that's one of the advantages of a
Linux/BSD ecosystem -- it can be tailored to lots of purposes.  The
Chromebook delivers exactly what it promises out of the box and comes with
100 GB of Gdrive cloud storage, free for 2 years (oh, and 12 free GoGo
in-flight Internet passes).  All in all, it seemed like a better option for
me than a tablet or those netbooks that are still around, but I think the
promising news is that there are seemingly an increasing number of less
spendy options that are gaining a foothold.

I recently became a ThinkPad dork (and reseller) after years of 
considering it and much recent research.

I need to run PC-BSD and the T4*0 and T5*0 models with NVidia graphics 
(can be disabled) and Intel wireless are the way to go. They are very 
much a "truck" but that truck can take UltraBay drives plus even an 
mSATA, making for a very flexible workstation. I am pleased with these 
caddies though removing some SSD's can be tricky:

http://www.newmodeus.com/

Note the slimmer "S" models as Scott points out and I think the factory 
Lenovo ones might be made for these and fit the taller models with a 
gap. The above caddies are an exact fit and support the eject etc.

The x2*0's are a great way to go if your OS has great Intel video support.

At the other end of the scale, stores like Office Max sometimes have 
Lenovo 16"-ers for insane prices like $288 on up. I don't know they they 
ship all the parts around for that! They are Sandy/Ivy bridge and will 
take 16GB of RAM but... my mouse button quickly wore out and I suspect 
they have the same components under the hood as the Acer or HP to the 
right or left of it. This may be the case with UltraBooks like the X1. 
There might be only a few reference models out there and vendors clad 
them to suit with cosmetics like, well, carbon fiber.

Handy tip: http://outlet.lenovo.com and always buy your RAM elsewhere. I 
think Lenovo even beats Apple's markup on RAM.

You could try Green Century[1] on SW Macadam in John's Landing.  Mostly they
sell stuff that's working but if you call ahead they might be able to set
aside what you're looking for.

Subject: [PLUG] Outgoing Email Problem
Message-ID: <50EDB72D.5000705@gisnet.com>

I've got a couple of configuration problems with email on a CentOS 
machine, and I don't nderstand what the errors are telling me. A quick 
check on Google just made things worse (apparently, several things can 
cause these errors.) So I'm looking for advice on how to track these 
things down and fix them. Here's what I'm seeing tn the logs:

Jan  9 10:22:22 oneimage postfix/smtpd[19511]: fatal: No server certs 
available. TLS can't be enabled
Jan  9 10:22:23 oneimage postfix/master[7667]: warning: process 
/usr/libexec/postfix/smtpd pid 19511 exit status 1
Jan  9 10:22:23 oneimage postfix/master[7667]: warning: 
/usr/libexec/postfix/smtpd: bad command startup -- throttling

These repeat excessively. What I was trying to do was configure Postfix 
/ Dovecot so that when I go to pick up my mail it is encrypted first. So 
I set the SMTP server to use "normal password" and SSL/TLS protocol on 
port 465. I don't think it's really asking for breath mints, so what's 
it talking about "certs" for? I think this is CentoOS 6. Anyway, Postfix 
was the default, not Sendmail.

Another problem (which is probably related) is that the machine I call 
in on and use to upload my email for delivery, gets it's IP via DHCP. 
But the IP that I'm assigned comes from Verizon, and they draw from a 
rather large pool of IPs. The range of potential IPs that I might be 
assigned even crosses class B networks. One hour my IP  might be 
75.220.34.136 and the next time it might be something completely 
different. In any case the possible range is large. So what would I use 
for $mynetworks in main.cf so that I can allow relaying for  my outgoing 
email?? Or for remote devices using DHCP, do you use another strategy to 
permit them to send outgoing mail?

I have no problems sending out email from my local network, so I'm 
pretty sure that I've got things partly right, but how do I tell the 
smtp server how to recognize me even if I  might be using any IP in say, 
75.192.0.0/10? Because if I put 75.192.0.0/10 in $mynetworks, that seems 
like a pretty wide filter and doesn't give me the security I want. Or am 
I totally confused on what's actually going on? (I'm pretty new to the 
whole subject of email transfers.)

Any help would be appreciated. I'm not getting anywhere on my own with 
this. If you need to see some log records or config settings Just tell 
me what you need to see and I'll post it.

TIA,
Bill Thoen

In order for postfix to run TLS, you have to have generated a server
certificate.  Normally (for a public server) you buy one from a
recognized certificate authority (CA) but it's easy to make your
own.  The drawback is that clients like Thunderbird will complain
about the certificate not being issued by a known CA.  You get the
"Server identity cannot be verified" (or similar) message.
Depending on the email client you use you may or may not be able
to "accept permanently" to skip the warning.

I run my own postfix server, but it's been a long time since I
had to generate a certificate, so I'll have to dig up my notes.

It's not clear from your post what the network architecture
looks like.  Does the postfix server have the DHCP address, or
are you referring to a different system?  Can you provide a
better description of the systems involved and how they networked?

The blurb below from this article,
http://postfixmail.com/blog/index.php/postfix-relay-control/, leads me to
believe it might be helpful in understanding and/or fixing your problem.

"The mynetworks parameter allows you to set individual IP Addresses or
subnets. When this parameter is used the mynetworks_style parameter is
ignored. In the example below an internal private network is included as
well as a public subnet. The example also includes a single IP Address.
This gives you flexibility in configuring the options.
mynetworks=192.168.5.0/24 12.32.34.32 216.168.0.1/24

> The only problem in the above example is that it requires that users have
> static Ip Addresses. If they have dynamic IP Addresses then Postfix must be
> configured fro SMTP authentication."

Your assumptions are correct. Bitmaps should probably be 300 dpi with
screen at 130 lpi or better. How high the screen can be depends on
resolution the output device is capable of, hence, check with the
printer on what dpi and lpi they recommend for bitmaps. 

Re places to get it done, check with Michael Dexter. He got some very
large posters for the PLUG booth at OSCON for a very reasonable price.
I think he said Costco, but my memory is dim.

Subject: [PLUG] Local (Portland/Beaverton) Colo at reasonable cost?
Message-ID: <50EDDDCF.5070608@jhmg.net>

I currently have a server with cari.net.  For about $60/month I get
root access on a Celeron 3GHz (dual core) with 4GB memory, 150GB disk
and 2TB/month bandwidth.  This is a real server sitting in a rack,
and is way more than enough capacity for my needs (hosting email and
a few small sites).

I've had this sytem for about 8 years, and normally every couple
of years I upgrade the OS. cari.net provides me a new box with
the new OS and I migrate my configuration, after which they
move the IPs to the new box.

cari.net is phasing out their low-end machines in favor of cloud
systems and much more expensive (and powerful) "real" systems.
To get something similar to what I have now would cost over
$100/month, which I can't justify.

Is there a local colo facility where I could rent a similar
hardware setup, or maybe even just a 1U space where I could
install my own box?  All I'd really need is power and
bandwidth.  Boot console access would be nice but I've
done fine without it. In 8 years I've had to ask cari.net
for a manual reboot twice.

Since I run an SMTP server, the only other requirement is IP
addresses on a blacklist-clean class C block.

Suggestions?

Bear Printing? I don't know about that size, but I know they did a great 
job with the business cards I needed a few years ago. Plus, they are a

why not just move to one of their cloud VPS products? for minimal needs as
you indicated, they're largely indistinguishable from physical servers.

Yes, an authorized reseller. While I will admire your ThinkPads, I will

Costo indeed. Something like $13 on up vs. $75 on up.

Note that they will not add while sides to images that do not meet their 
dimensions. You need to add these yourself in the source file and I 
suggest you bring your notebook. *cough* their demo systems do not have 
photo editing software on them.

They have example images with sizes under glass at the photo table but 
neither the flier nor web site has detailed information or pricing.

Related: I never saw their many Seagate and WD drives on their site even 
though they have pallets of them in the store. Cable modem and web cam 
for that matter too!

They've structured things so even that option is more expensive by
way overpricing disk storage ($0.50/GB/Month).

For the same $60 I would get 2 cores, 1GB mem and 40GB disk.
If disk weren't so expensive the VPS solution would be perfect.

Bear Printing has been outright awesome about brochures and business 
cards which is their bread and butter for a specific industry. I will 
also put Bill's FreePBX talk on the virtual top ten list.

I am not sure about his poster capacity but Costco is ruthless on pricing.*

* For what it's worth, the Fred Meyer electronics sections can have some 
surprisingly-good sale deals with the little orange tag and I assume 
that they take a similar "there's nothing sacred about this SKU" 
approach like a computer reseller might.

Do you or anyone else know him well enough to ask?

I reached out to over a dozen people yesterday who have demonstrated 
interest in presenting and have quite a few responses.

For those who were not at the December General meeting, we had a 
post-presentation discussion about the coming year. One point that 
people made is that public policy talks along the lines of the Open 
Source at the Oregon Department of Revenue and Open Source in K-12 
Education ones. No other groups appear to be covering these high-level 
topics on a consistent basis and... have no fear, there is no way they 
can dominate the schedule given the completely-random availability of 
speakers.

Please do think about what talks YOU might want to give because I know 
everyone has awesome topic that is obvious to them and completely new 
and fascinating to the rest of us. Also, please reach out to anyone you 
think may be willing to talk. You'll be surprised by what pet projects 
smart people have that they have never mentioned.

Thanks!

Michael

Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced Topics Meeting Announcement

Who: You! Brief presentation by Michael Dexter
What: Talk and Roundtable: Recoupling Computer Science and Computing
Where: Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue, Portland (Left Entrance)
When: Tuesday, January 15th, 2013 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of awesome, open technologies.

There is no question that hybrid telecommunication/computing appliances 
like those running iOS and Android have put more open source software 
into the hands of users than any other effort to date but vendors and 
carriers consistently choose user control over user freedom. While many 
users and vendors will argue that "people want their systems to 'just 
work'", intentional and unintentional decoupling of the user computing 
experiences from the underlying computer science is the norm, despite 
the fact that developers and systems administrators are equally lazy and 
"want their systems to 'just work'".

Because no technical barrier exists between these two experiences of a 
given system, this talk will explore the historic and modern systems 
that provide the best balance of user and developer experience and open 
up to a roundtable discussion of other such systems and how to bridge 
these two experiences and foster computer science in society.

Please be prepared to talk about your experiences, particularly on 
platforms like Android and web frameworks which can offer full-stack 
access to sources yet deliver a competitive user experience.

See you there!


Many will break for the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne afterwards.

Thanks, but this article (besides being rather poorly written) sort of 
falls apart  at the end and fades out suddenly, just as it gets to the 
good stuff; configuring SMTP server. But it mentions dynamic IP 
addresses only to say that dealing with them is hard. (and I know that 
already!) The article assumes you're working with static IPs.

The problem I'm having is that I have two remote computers  that I may 
want to to use to send email to someone outside my network. They are 
both connected to the Internet via dhcp provided by either my ISP or 
verizon.com. I solved the problem for the first one by looking throuh 
the logs to see what IPs they were assigning to me. Fortunately, the 
possibilities were limited, and so I simply added an entry for each 
class C address that covered the addresses I had been assigned before. 
That solved the problem with that machine and even though I 'm allowing 
potential easy access to 500 IPs or so that I don't know, this did work.

The other one that uses Verizon's service has lots of variation in the 
dynamic IPs it assigns. It doesn't see practical to put something like  
75.0.0.0/8 in $mynetworks because that leaves the door open to over 16 
million IPs. So what I'm wondering is if there is another way for me to 
identify myself so that my server will let me upload mail (to Dovecot) 
I've composed on the tablet and then send it back out to the Internet 
heading  to the person to whom it's addressed?

If I understand this correctly another method is to create a certificate 
with encryption, and by using public and private eys, etc. so that my 
server knows that it's me and that it should relay mail for me. That 
sounds like the right solution. I don't need anything from an official 
company if I can make these myself, it won't bother me if it complains 
that the certificate is home made. As long as it delivers my mail. 
Anyone know any good articles about creating certificates, or is ti 
simple enough to just relate?

Cheers!

The server is physicaly in my office, and the computers I'm wanting to 
use are getting Internet access from two different ISPs, but both 
generate DHCP IP addresses when I use these machines online. My server 
doesn't know them as "friendlies" so it won't accept any mail from them 
for redelivery.

When you refer to making your own certs is this the same certificate 
generator that you use for say, pass-wordless logins?  If so, then I've 
got notes on that.

Hi, Bill!

   I don't know if my solution will work for you but I'll make it available
for your consideration.

   Here, postfix is on the main server/workstation. Since Frontier
Communications bought the Verizon Northwest land line business they stopped
supporting static IP addresses; some times they change my DHCP-issued IP
address 40 times overnight. So now all my outgoing mail must be relayed
through the SMTP server at my ISP instead of going directly toward the
recipient. But, it's made no difference in remotely sending mail from my
laptop when I'm traveling.

   I use ssh to remotely log in on my server, then open alpine in a virtual
console, and read/write messages using this MUA. When a message is sent it
is from my main server to the ISP and gets to the addressee with no more
hassle than if I was sitting at my desk in the office. I'm sure it would
work equally well if you use a GUI MUA on your office server.

Happy New Year,

Rich

Message-ID: <50EF3E89.3060002@comcast.net>

My test machine, a Gateway E-4500D that I got a couple of months ago at 
Free Geek, has developed an odd power problem. I had it on, and wasn't 
paying attention to it. I turned to it and move the mouse to bring it 
out of power saver mode, but nothing happened. It runs very quietly, 
once it's on, so it didn't occur to me that it was powered off. 
Eventually I figured that out. However, when I push the power button 
nothing happens. I pulled the power cord out of the back, waited a few 
seconds, put it back in, and pushed the power button. The fan comes on 
loud, which it usually does when the power cord's been disconnected, but 
the machine doesn't start to boot, and the blue light in the middle of 
the power button does not light.

Any ideas where to start troubleshooting this one?

Thanks.

Swap out power supplies.  A power supply produces several different
voltages (+12, -12, +5) that feed different subsystems.  One of
these may be bad, so the place to start is with a different power
supply.

One test you might try before that is disconnecting power
from every internal device (hard disk, floppy, DVD) except the
motherboard to see if you can get to the BIOS.

Do you get any beep codes (sequences of beeps in distinct
groupings).  If so check the motherboard manufacturer's
support documents to decipher the codes.

Not that I noticed. Just the loud fan noise. I'll have the box open when 
I power it up after disconnecting the other stuff. I assume it's not a 
good idea to let it run very long without the CPU fan running.

I would strongly suggest *not* disconnecting the CPU fan.
What they are saying is disconnect the major load inducing peripherals,
basically the drives (hard drive, optical drives, floppy, etc).

It depends on what type of CPU you are using, what generation, etc... but
running a CPU with no cooling for any appreciable amount of time can lead
to trouble.
In some cases with older hardware, it can literally mean the CPU could
smoke itself!  *see below

I know in your case (it sounds like anyway) you are not actually removing
the heatsink/fan assembly, so you should be OK for a brief amount of time.
I have learned by the school of hard knocks to be extra cautious with this
kind of thing.







*I have a nice little "war story" about that if anyone cares to keep
reading.

---[begin war story]----

I worked for a small company a few years back, eRacks.com, based in So.
CA.  They are a reseller of mostly rackmount servers, but with Linux/BSD
pre-installed.  They also do desktops, and after I was there, laptops (I
helped launch that).

Anyway I wore many hats there, including system engineer, software install
and setup, even equipment purchasing at one point.  Another was hardware
assembly.  This was my first time really working with heavy duty
"enterprise" class hardware, not just typical desktop stuff I usually
worked on.  They do everything from basic 1U type servers with a "desktop"
type motherboard, to more complex setups in 1U, 2U, 4U, and I think even a
5U.  Custom ordered chassis, custom routed cooling (in some cases I helped
figure that out for a particular chassis setup even).  Quite fun.

So early in my time there I was doing hardware assembly, and initial "burn
in" tests on a bunch of 1U servers, with AMD CPUs.  This was the 32bit
AthlonXP days... Palomino or Thoroughbred I think they were, around that
generation.  For those who aren't aware, those CPUs had very little
temperature control/tolerance.  As in, if you maybe somehow accidentally
powered on a system with an AthlonXP, with no heatsink/fan assembly, you
had a smoked CPU.  Been there, done that, *once*.  Yes cone of shame for me
;).

So I had a sort of assembly line going, setting the systems up, installing
the CPU, RAM, HDD, etc, and the custom sized heatsink/fans that would work
in a 1U chassis.
I had some already setup, and powered on, running Memtest and CPU burn in
procedures.  So I was getting in to a bit of a zone, and went through a
line of systems, which I thought were all done, and powered them on.  I got
to one machine, and within 2 seconds of hitting the power rocker switch I
had an "oh crap" moment... I didn't have the heatsink/fan on one of them.
It was a bare CPU, and by the time I reached to the back to turn it off at
the power supply, the CPU had literally let out a puff of smoke.
My boss is a tech, not a marketing type, so he was at least understanding
about the incident, sometimes this kind of stuff happens, but of course
gave me a stern warning to be more careful, and of course I was after that.

As an addendum, some time later, we received a stack of similar 1U AMD
based systems back for repair from a big client (not sure if I should give
their name, but a major So. CA university).  They were using the systems
for some bio-science simulations and such.  Apparently the rack setup in
their lab was sub-obtimal though, because the entire stack of systems
(maybe 10-12 I think it was?) had burned out CPUs.  Though in this case
they all did have their heatsink/fans.  They had simply stacked the
machines, one on top of another, not mounted in a rack with proper air
space between them.  We had to replace them with systems that had more
cooling and better airflow in the chassis, and of course a strong
suggestion to actually mount them in a rack ;).

OK that's it for today thanks for reading.

I suspected as much, and indeed was planning to do that, first. I think 
I'll be able to hear any beeps if I do it while paying attention to it 
with the cover off.

Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.80GHz

No. I wouldn't want to fuss with the CPU heat sink. I've done that 
before, and I'd rather not mess with the heat sink grease, etc. The fan 
assembly is a nice heavy plastic that easily slides over the outer fins 
of the heat sink. As mentioned in an earlier, unrelated post, it also 
has a speaker inside the fan housing.

Thanks for the cautionary advice, and the interesting war story.

The CPU fan plugs into the motherboard, not the power supply directly
DON'T run the system with the CPU fan (or any other fan that
plugs into the motherboard) disconnected.  Disconnect only
peripherals that get their power directly from the PS via
4-pin plugs or SATA power connectors.  If you have a graphics
card that needs auxiliary power and has a PS connector, I
believe you can run those without the aux power but won't have
access to the high-end functions of the GPU, which you won't need.

I'll be sure just to disconnect the power going to the hard drive and to 
the DVD drive. I'm pretty sure those are the only things other than the 
motherboard getting power from the power supply.

I'm using the on-board video in this machine, although some day I hope 
to put in a higher end video card.


Thanks for the clarification.

Subject: [PLUG] WRT54G Config.bin
Message-ID: <50EFA15B.3000205@comcast.net>

Over the past few weeks I've found my machines unable to access the 
Internet first thing in the morning. At first I thought it was the cable 
modem. So I followed the method of pulling the plug on the modem, 
waiting a few seconds, and then plugging it back in. Since I have done 
this over the years I learned that sometimes my router would need to be 
reset as well, so I usually pull the power plug out of it before 
plugging the modem back in. I'd then wait for all the lights on the 
modem to turn green before plugging the router back in.

But then I tried plugging a machine directly into the modem and it had 
no problem getting out. That led me to believe it might be the router. 
The next time I experienced the problem I just power cycled the router 
and things worked as they normally do. This leads me to suspect my 
WRT54G might be wearing out. I have a spare, so I'm more or less 
prepared to swap them. I started thinking about how much documenting I'd 
need to do to gather all the settings on the current router and started 
looking through the pdf version of the manual and found that there is 
the ability to backup the configuration to a file, Config.bin. I have 
done this and will try setting up the backup router with the 
configuration of the current one.

I'd like to see what's inside that config file, but I find that it is 
indeed a binary file. Less will display it, but what it shows is mostly 
useless. Is there some way to view the contents of that file in a human 
readable way? I'm just curious to see if there's a way to create a 
document to help me if both routers go south and I need to set up a 
third one some day. I could always step through each page of the 
router's administration tool, but that would be a mite tedious -- but 
doable if that's the only way.

Next time this happenns, I would try to log into the web interface of
the WRT54G and see if it has an IP address or a lease.  I've seen
several cases recently where a lease renewal doesn't happen and the
leasee gives up and sits there dumbly with no address.  Naturally,
your packets then go nowhere.

The other thing I'd do is (if the router is reflashable) is put
OpenWrt on it, so that you can log in and investigate more
thoroughly.

Oh, and then I'd get a new router.  I just started playing with a
Buffalo WZR-600DHP (dual band, 680 MHz CPU, gigE ports, 128 meg ram,
32 meg flash, supported by OpenWrt).  $70 from newegg or amazon.

I'll do that the next time it happens.

It's a model # WRT54G ver. 6, Firmware Version v1.00.9, May 12, 2006.

Under the Administration tab on the router's page there is a section 
called Firmware Upgrade. If there's an upgrade suitable for my model, 
then that's something I'll think about.

I am writing a script that auto-installs a bunch of things that I need on several system. The point here is I run the script, and when I come back, everything is installed. Everything is working, except installing a single CPAN module. It's Crypt::SSLeay, which is actually a dependency of the REST::Client module that I require on these systems. It gets to this, and stops to wait for my input:

  CPAN.pm: Going to build N/NA/NANIS/Crypt-SSLeay-0.64.tar.gz

The test suite can attempt to connect to public servers to ensure that the
code is working properly. If you are behind a strict firewall or have no
network connectivity, these tests may fail (through no fault of the code).
Do you want to run the live tests (y/N)? [N] 

I press [ENTER] and it continues. When it's done, everything works as desired, so, for my purposes, any additional testing that would be done seems un-needed. 

How do I get this to just accept the default and continue, without the manual key press?

Version 6 doesn't have enough flash to support OpenWrt, unfortunately,
only 2 meg, iirc.  There is/was a micro-image of ddWRT that would fit,
but that provides not very much in the way of tools that would help
you diagnose.

Now you mention it, I recall something like that from a couple of years 
ago when I first put this used router into service here.

Thanks for saving me some time digging that bit of info up again.

Maybe you could install the specific dependency causing the problem
first, and perhaps download/patch it to skip the step causing the
blockage before installing.  I don't actually know much about how CPAN
works, but if it's like other systems then maybe you can decompose the
download/install steps.

Stab in the dark, I'm afraid.

That's just it. The tests don't fail. It won't run the (offline) tests, or any tests for that matter, unless I press the enter key. Pressing the enter key allows it to run the tests, in offline mode, which pass, and the module installs as expected.

Thanks for the suggestions.  I will probably go with Cedar House
Printing in Beaverton ( 48x36, $36, two 20 inch wide strips). 

Bear Printing does 13x19 max.  See http://wiki.keithl.com/Posters
for results from Costco and Kinkos, and others if I hear about them.

Everybody I contacted is a CMYK pixel shop.

I will ask Cedar House for a color test pattern printout, and a
file that I can print on my 600dpi HP2605 color laser, so I can
match colors and do first proofing here.

I'll let folks know how this turns out.

Keith

Russell,

   Would incorporating /usr/bin/expect in your script effectively provide the
[Enter] keypress CPAN wants?

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1301131022100.26306@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've been digging further trying to get sound working on the Sony Vaio
PCG-61A14L with its Intel sound chip(s).

   Found a Slackware page that suggested adding
/etc/modprobe.d/snd-hda-intel.conf with an option of model=auto. That did
not fix the problem. Neither did changing the model to vaio.

   Next on the page were instructions on checking /proc/sound/ for the
installed codecs; that revealed two of them: Conextant GXZ0590 and Intel
CougarPoint HDMI. A search of the source code document directory file for
the snd-hda-intel Codecs did not find either of these.

   A DuckDuckGo search for the make, model, and 'snd-hda-intel' found a
number of hits referring to ubuntu and CentOS. Tried a couple of their
reported solutions, but to no avail. A related search for make, model,
distribution and 'no sound' returned a few hits on the make and model but
that's all.

   When I try to play a test .mp3 the system tells me no driver is found. I'm
confident that we have sufficient hardware, Intel, and driver module
expertise on the list here to help me figure out what to do next. If more
information would be helpful I'll get it.

Thanks,

Rich

Did you check 'lspci" to see if the kernel sees the Intel sound chip?  I 
don't have my Intel laptop running, but you should see something like 
this as root:

$ sudo /sbin/lspci |grep -E 'Audio|audio'
01:00.1 Audio device: nVidia Corporation GF108 High Definition Audio 
Controller (rev a1)
03:03.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB Audigy (rev 03)

$ /sbin/lspci -v

...
03:03.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB Audigy (rev 03)
     Subsystem: Creative Labs SB0090 Audigy Player
     Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 21
     I/O ports at e400 [size=32]
     Capabilities: [dc] Power Management version 2
     Kernel driver in use: snd_emu10k1
...

If the "kernel driver in use" is missing or blank,then you don't have 
the Alsa kernel module loaded.  Also, in my example, and in your 
statement above, you have a HDMI controller (mine's on the Geforce 
GT430).  Your audio might be going to that by default.  for example, 
/etc/modprobe.d/sound.conf

alias snd-card-0 snd-emu10k1
alias sound-slot-0 snd-emu10k1

and /etc/modprobe.d/snd-hdmi.conf

# Don't load HDMI sound from the Nvidia GPU card
blacklist snd_hda_intel

As I do not use the HDMI port.

Also, did you run alsamixer to make sure you sound is not muted? Did run 
check "aplay -L' to see what audio channels ALSA found ('aplay -l' gives 
devices 'small ell')?  And then use "speaker-test" to see where the 
sound is going? For example,

$ aplay -L

I don't know how much help I can be, but I'll give it a stab.
First off, is the driver even being loaded?  Run the following
commands and post the results for them:

$ lsmod | grep snd
$ cat /proc/asound/cards

The lsmod will show if the driver is being loaded (i.e., "snd" is
using "snd_hda_intel").  The cat will tell us what the kernel is
calling your sound "card", be it a separate card or built-in
chip.  If the module isn't being loaded, you'll have to check
dmesg and /var/log/messages to find out what's going on.

If results of those commands look good, then it's time to start
looking elsewhere.  You said you were using an mp3 file for
testing.  What happens if you use a WAV or OggVorbis file?  (The
"driver" spoken of may be the MP3 codec.)  What are you using to
play the file?  Are you running PulseAudio?  If so, what does
pavucontrol show for available sound devices?  (It should be the
name shown in the /proc/asound/cards file, above.)

That should get you started.  I hope it helps.

   Yes, the _very_ first thing I did was ensure the sound was on in
alsamixer.

   Tried to play an .mp3 file with mpg123:

[oss.c:172] error: Can't open default sound device!
[audio.c:630] error: failed to open audio device
[audio.c:180] error: Unable to find a working output module in this list: alsa,oss
[audio.c:532] error: Failed to open audio output module
[mpg123.c:897] error: Failed to initialize output, goodbye.

   aplay -l also tells me there's no sound card found. Sigh.

   I had a much earlier Sony Vaio model for years (2004-2010) that did not
exhibit these issues. What is my next step?

Many thanks,

Rich

   However, now there's a problem with alsamixer (and aumix).

   Trying to run alsamixer returns 'cannot open mixer: no such file or
directory.' The alsa packages are installed and /usr/bin/alsamixer is
present (66648 bytes) with 755 permissions, yet even the full path
invocation returns the same message. What might cause this?

Dale,

   Followed these steps and there are snd modules loaded, including 
snd-hda-intel. Card 0 is PCH; HDA Intel PCH at 0xd2600000 irq 41.

   No, I didn't try another player or sound format.

If you want "it just works" CPAN module installation, cpanminus 
(http://p3rl.org/cpanm aka `curl -L cpanmin.us > cpanm`) is much easier 
than CPAN.pm / CPANPLUS.pm... so unless you need special features, you 
can stop reading now.

Now, a knob you should not need to worry about because cpanminus does 
what you want by default:  If you set the environment variable 
PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1, that will cover all cases where the author is 
correctly using the prompt() command to request input at build time.  
(Sadly, there are cases where this isn't true, and one may occasionally 
need </dev/null, but I don't believe this one is such a case.)

What version of alsa-utils are you running?  I've got the latest
(1.0.26) here, and my alsamixer is 77312 bytes.  It's possible you
have a corrupted file.  (Or it could just be differences in how
Fedora and Slackware compiled it.)

In your reply to my previous message, you said that the module was
loaded, and that the kernel could see the card.  This is good, since
it helps narrow down the problem.  It's possible that your alsa
installation is broken.  This would certainly account for your
troubles.  Note, too, that asla defaults to all outputs muted, until
something comes along and unmutes them, which is probably why you
don't have any sound.  You might try re-installing alsa, and see if
that helps.

You also might want to check the Alsa home page,
<http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Main_Page>, to see if they
have any hints.

Hope this helps.

   Thanks to Bill Barry I use whatismyip.com in a shell script that runs
every 15 minutes. If Frontier has changed my IP address, then the script
effects that change at the registrar's DNS servers.

   Today I actually read the message associated with an IP address change and
learned that whatismyip.com has removed the Microsoft .asp version of their
tool. Now, an un-registered user gets 5 IP address lookups per _day_. With a
free account a registered user gets 12 IP address lookups per _hour_. Since
my cron job runs 4 times per hour that is certainly adequate for my needs.
The provider also has two higher-level memberships for pay (from $1/month to
$50/year).

   For others here using (or considering using) whatismyip.com, here's the

i alternate periodically between using a cloud-hosted script on my 
linode that dumps the clients IP, and using icanhazip.com (also supports 
ipv6). no registration required, and haven't hit any limits yet.

there's also: http://v4.ipv6-test.com/api/myip.php, which seems to work 
pretty well.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced Topics Meeting Announcement

Who: You! Brief presentation by Michael Dexter
What: Talk and Roundtable: Recoupling Computer Science and Computing
Where: Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue, Portland (Left Entrance)
When: Tuesday, January 15th, 2013 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of awesome, open technologies.

There is no question that hybrid telecommunication/computing appliances 
like those running iOS and Android have put more open source software 
into the hands of users than any other effort to date but vendors and 
carriers consistently choose user control over user freedom. While many 
users and vendors will argue that "people want their systems to 'just 
work'", intentional and unintentional decoupling of the user computing 
experiences from the underlying computer science is the norm, despite 
the fact that developers and systems administrators are equally lazy and 
"want their systems to 'just work'".

Because no technical barrier exists between these two experiences of a 
given system, this talk will explore the historic and modern systems 
that provide the best balance of user and developer experience and open 
up to a roundtable discussion of other such systems and how to bridge 
these two experiences and foster computer science in society.

Please be prepared to talk about your experiences, particularly on 
platforms like Android and web frameworks which can offer full-stack 
access to sources yet deliver a competitive user experience.

See you there!


Many will break for the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne afterwards.

   Here's another sound issue that might be at the root of the problem: for a
reason I have not been able to determine, a user on the Sony cannot run
'alsamixer'; not even '/usr/bin/alsamixer'; the kernel returns 'file or
directory not found.'

   But, the permissions on /usr/bin/alsamixer are 755, as they are on my
server/workstation, and a user on the latter can invoke alsamixer. What
might be the problem here? This may be the key to the whole sound issue.

Stab in the dark here... Is /usr/bin/alsamixer an executable, or a script of some kind? If it's a script, you'll get the same error if something within the script isn't found. What is the output of 'file /usr/bin/alsamixer' on both machines?

A good way to update your dynamic IP is from within the router itself. It
knows best when its IP address has changed and many routers, especially the
linux based ones, have a configurable DDNS script that will update your DNS
information.

Russell,

   It's an executable; the perms are 755.

   I'll check the bit-ness on the Sony this evening.

In an executable (non-script), you'll get this error if a library is
missing. try ldd /usr/bin/alsamixer and make sure everything it lists
actually exists.

I ask because a script can be an executable as well. There are also a lot of links in that directory, and this type of error usually indicates that something (script, actual executable, or link) is broken.

Russell,

   Just for giggles, I re-installed alsa-lib, alsa-oss, and alsa-utils. That
should have fixed any broken piece.

On Slackware "alsamixer" is a binary file and should be permissions 755, 
root:root and set executable. Also, the user should be in the "audio" 
group.  Is "alsamixer" actually present and not a link to elsewhere?

Rich, do you have issues with hearing sound logged in as root or just 
when logged in as a regular user?  This could indicate a permissions 
problem. alsamixer may run but then can't find the correct nodes.  For 
example, these are the recommended groups for desktop users: audio cdrom 
floppy plugdev video power netdev lp scanner.

For example,

$ ls -l /dev | grep audio

crw-rw---- 1 root    audio      14,  14 Jan 13 10:47 admmidi
crw-rw---- 1 root    audio      14,  12 Jan 13 10:47 adsp
crw-rw---- 1 root    audio      14,  13 Jan 13 10:47 amidi
crw-rw---- 1 root    audio      14,   4 Jan 13 10:47 audio
crw-rw---- 1 root    audio      14,   9 Jan 13 10:47 dmmidi
crw-rw---- 1 root    audio      14,   3 Jan 13 10:47 dsp
crw-rw---- 1 root    audio      14,   2 Jan 13 10:47 midi
crw-rw---- 1 root    audio      14,   0 Jan 13 10:47 mixer
crw-rw---- 1 root    audio      14,   1 Jan 13 10:47 sequencer
crw-rw---- 1 root    audio      14,   8 Jan 13 10:47 sequencer2

$ ls -l /dev/snd

crw-rw---- 1 root audio 116, 11 Jan 13 10:47 controlC0
crw-rw---- 1 root audio 116,  2 Jan 13 10:47 hwC0D0
crw-rw---- 1 root audio 116,  4 Jan 13 10:47 midiC0D0
crw-rw---- 1 root audio 116,  3 Jan 13 10:47 midiC0D1
crw-rw---- 1 root audio 116, 10 Jan 13 10:47 pcmC0D0c
crw-rw---- 1 root audio 116,  9 Jan 14 13:04 pcmC0D0p
crw-rw---- 1 root audio 116,  8 Jan 13 10:47 pcmC0D1c
crw-rw---- 1 root audio 116,  7 Jan 13 10:47 pcmC0D2c

crw-rw---- 1 root audio 116,  1 Jan 13 10:47 seq
crw-rw---- 1 root audio 116, 33 Jan 13 10:47 timer

(These and for a SoundBlaster Audigy, your exact node name may differ a 
bit for Intel).

  If root has no sound, then you may want to try uninstalling and 
reinstalling the alsa packages in the AP and L series Slackware 
directories because something may have gotten borked.

I've had various DSL and cable providers over the years, and never found 
my dynamic IP to change very often.  With Comcast now and my IP hasn't 
changed in a year!  Checking very 15 minutes seems to be a bit 
overkill.  Typically, you will have a IP lease time and then only swap 
out when the modem reboots.  For the small game server I run under my 
desk, I typically have dyndns only check once every 24hrs.

Ed,

   Ever since Frontier took over Verizon Northwest's land lines and stopped
supporting static IP addresses (at least for ISPs like Aracnet/SpiritOne), I
get a new IP address frequently. It's slowed down some now but I was getting
30-40 changes a day (usually from the evening to the next morning). Now I
see only 3-4 every day or two. Before I started checking frequently I'd
often log in early in the morning and find that mail stopped arriving some
time during the previous evening or night. Then I'd need to find my current
IP address and manually update the DNS servers. PITA.

   Yeah, I know that DHCP leases are supposed to be longer, but apparently no
one told Frontier about that.

Reviews are good, including several from folks running the current
Ubuntu LTS on it.

Intel says there's an i5- and USB3.0-equipped version coming out in
April that might be worth waiting for, but regardless this seems like
a much better machine than a MacMini for someone like me who wants a
super-small and -quiet box and has no use for MacOS.

Message-ID: <CAArUT0gYPr2GNWwBdwpmko7KBL4ceYzNoUrbhzYAtP-XM4awqA@mail.gmail.com>

I need to (sometime) upgrade my desktop from ubuntu 11.04 LTS to
something 12.04 LTS.  Not being happy with Unity, I think I have
settled on XFCE.

The choices I solicit opinions on are:
1)upgrade to Ubuntu 12.04 then switch to XFCE
2)Fresh install of Xubuntu 12.04.

I do not see an option to upgrade from Ubuntu 11.04 to Xubuntu 12.04,
but if such an option exists, make it #3.

1) is easier, but others have reported problems with upgrades.  Also,
switching to XFCE after installing Unity some people have complained
about.

Thanks,

-Denis

yes, there's several nice options that don't require you to parse out

that's insanity. i can't imagine this makes managing their network any

   To annoy customers and drive them from independent ISPs to their fiber?
Even one of the aracnet guys suffers the same problems. There is something
about the ISP's hardware at the Frontier CO that would need to be changed at
large expense to allow us peons to run static IP addresses.

   And now I need to route outgoing mail through aracnet's mail server rather
than having it go directly from postfix here.

Whether to choose new install or upgrade depends to a large extent on
how much you have invested in your current installation. In my case it
would take a week to reinstall all programs and reconfigure everything,
so I always go for an upgrade. Usually it goes OK, although sometimes I
have some grief to fix afterward. But if you have little in the way of
personal customizations and installed applications, I'd go for the
fresh install.

I agree with J**3 about an upgrade vs. fresh install.  However, I've had 
two experiences with 12.04 installing one desktop and then deciding

Message-ID: <50F5BF28.4040508@ambidexter.com>


Hello all,

I confess that it's been just root and me on my boxes for... ever but I 
am now configuring more workgroup networks. As with all good 
documentation, I come across lots of "here's how you configure group 
permissions" with zero attention to strategies such as common r/o files, 
shared individual files, private files, per-user drop boxes for other 
users, mobile groups and the like... then the fun of when Samba does and 
does not respect specific permissions and then of course ACL's and how 
NFS might see things.

The best model for this I have found is "Samba 3 by Example" which 
describes hypothetical offices but only a handful without newfangled 
things like Mac TimeMachine backups, shadow copies and the like.

Clearly one can easily paint themselves into several distributed corners.

Links?

Might someone want to give a talk on this subject?

Michael

Thanks to both of you.  I will likely take what appears at this point
to be the easier route (upgrade), hoping that it will not prove more
difficult in the long run.

Subject: [PLUG] 64 bit Ubuntu 12.04
Message-ID: <50F6009E.3030008@comcast.net>

When one goes to the download page for Ubuntu 12.04 on finds two options 
for the Desktop CD, on labeled "PC (Intel x86) desktop CD," and the 
other labeled, "64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop CD." The description of the 
first option makes it clear that it applies to, "Intel/AMD/etc type 
processors." The description of the second option is less clear. It 
says, "Choose this to take full advantage of computers based on the 
AMD64 or EM64T architecture (e.g., Athlon64, Opteron, EM64T Xeon, Core 
2)." The description of the processor chip in my test machine doesn't 
use any of the words in the Ubuntu 64 bit description, but from recent 
web research it appears that it does indeed apply to my processor.

So, just to be sure, does the 64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop CD really apply 
to my Intel processor?

Thanks.

Maybe you have this in another post, but can you tell us exactly what model
CPU you have?
Output of /proc/cpuinfo would help also.

Basically if your system is 64bit you would want to use the 64bit version,
but there could be gotchas if you have never used 64bit before.
If your system has 4GB or less of RAM the benefits of using the 64bit
version aren't as apparent (32bit OS can only use 4GB without modification).

More or less any Intel CPU post Core 2 Duo (Conroe) era is 64bit.

Most distros these days will have an x86 (32bit) and a 64bit version, the
second option from Ubuntu is for 64bit CPUs, either AMD or Intel.

If I recall correctly (sorry, don't have time to verify via Wikipedia,
etc.)...

Intel's original 64-bit architecture/instruction set (for Itanium
processors) was not a commercial success... at least not in the consumer
space. The instruction set used by Intel's non-Itanium processors is
more-or-less the same as the one that AMD adopted for their original 64-bit
processors (Itanium competitors?)... I'm not really sure who created that
instruction set (AMD, Intel, other?)... but AMD is usually given the
"credit" as you have found... although I feel the "x86-64" phrasing to be
more clear/accurate (although more easily mistaken for just plain old "x86".

I'm sure someone here has a deeper understanding, better recollection,
and/or or more time to look it up right now than I do... hopefully I
haven't led you too far astray.  :-)

Alas, it has only 3GB right now. I'll probably upgrade it some day.

That's where I first got a clue that AMD didn't mean AMD only with 
Ubuntu releases.

One good point in favor of upgrading is that, if it goes horribly wrong
and you have a system too messed up to fix, you can just turn around
and do a fresh install. In other words, you might as well try an
upgrade, because there is nothing lost in doing so.

But one caution: Be very sure that nothing happens to your net
connection during the upgrade. Ubuntu downloads the new packages and
installs them as it does so. If you lose the net connection in the
middle you will have a partially upgraded operating system.

So according to the [flags] section you do indeed have a 64bit CPU.
This reference is helpful.  The main thing to look for is the "lm" flag,
which AMD first called "long mode", for 64bit addressing.

http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/43539/what-do-the-flags-in-proc-cpuinfo-mean


Also, according to Intel info, your CPU is a Pentium D, either Smithfield
or Pressler line, which came after Pentium 4 and before Core 2 series.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_D

So even though you only have 3GB RAM it might not hurt to jump into the
64bit pool now, get used to any quirks (probably not as many as when 64bit
first came to consumer desktops), so you can be prepared to take advantage
of it if/when you get more RAM.  And let's face it more RAM is always a
nice thing to have ;).

Hey all.
I have tried a bit of Google-fu but so far just getting articles about
booting from either DVD or USB.
In my case I kind of want to do both.

My laptop is an older beast, Pentium M 32bit aka Centrino.  It is a
whitebox unit made by Compal (not Compaq), model CL50, I have had it for
many years and it runs Linux well.
Only real problem with it, it cannot boot from USB.  I have checked for
updates to BIOS, it has the latest that was available for this motherboard.

I have Linux Mint 13 on it, and want to do a fresh install of Mint 14.  I
have Mint 14 image on a USB drive, and the Mint 13 live DVD.
I was hoping to find a way to boot the live DVD, then tell it to continue
loading from the flash drive, so I can install.  This would save having to
burn more DVDs for each upgrade.
I tried fiddling with the options the live DVD has, it does have an option
to boot local disk, but that means hard drive.
I would like to boot from USB flash drive.  The syntax it uses is
unfamiliar, I don't know if it is newer GRUB or it isn't GRUB at all.

If possible I could use a SuperGRUB boot CD (pretty sure I have one, if not
I could of course burn that).  I just want to try to get off the treadmill
of burning new DVDs for each release.

If anyone has actually done this sort of thing I would appreciate pointers,
otherwise I'll just keep digging probably in GRUB or Mint forums etc.
Thanks.

I don't believe I've seen the description of your processor, so I have no frame of reference.

Probably depends some what on the specific project you're working on.  For example, are you sticking with plain
groups?  ACLs? RBAC?  the multitude of flavors in MAC?  There are lots of ways to configure "group access".

A quick look at your sample of Samba looks like the focus is mostly on things like group permissions and sticky bits.

My suggestion would probably be to start with a white board and write some things down about how you want
to organize things, then follow up by drawing an example or three on the board to make sure your idea can apply in different ways, all of which fall under your umbrella of "this project".  Once you have your idea and examples solidified,
it should be fairly straight forward to execute the commands.

I have "DDR2 Synchronous 533 MHz" installed now, two 1GB sticks and two 
512 MB sticks. One of these days I'll see if I can find some more 1GB 
sticks. I did a bit of web searching and see on Wikipedia 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR2_SDRAM) that I can mix memory with 
different speed ratings, but that the motherboard will probably run the 
higher rated memory at the lower speed. Is this something to be avoided?

Indeed. I've been fooling with Kdenlive (video editing program) and had 
it installed on both machines. I ran into a shortage of memory issue on 
the machine with only 3GB that wasn't a problem on the machine with 4GB.

Thanks for the insights.

Excellent, welcome to the "big pool" ;)

well at least perhaps, the "big-endian pool"?   *ba doom boom kisshh*

Running mixed speed RAM sticks won't hurt, it just means your higher rated
RAM isn't performing up to its optimum capability.
So, avoided in the case that you want to be running everything at its best,
then yes.  Avoided to prevent permanent damage, not necessarily.

You might check the docs for your specific motherboard to see the max
amount of RAM it can use (and max speed rating), in many cases for desktop
boards with 64bit CPU, it is 8GB or 16GB.  Server rated boards can get into
some big numbers such as 128GB etc.
In any case it would make sense to get rid of the older slower sticks and
put in newer faster higher capacity sticks.

Something to look for, if/when shopping for new RAM, there seems to be a
good deal of savings when buying them in pairs, such as 2 x 1GB sticks, or
2 x 2GB sticks etc.
At least I usually see this on places I shop such as Newegg.com.  I just
bought a pair of 2GB sticks which will be going in to my wife's computer.

Oh definitely for video editing more RAM can certainly help.

Resources on baseline best-practices would be appreciated given that 
getting one scenario to work may not be to get it right nor plan for 
future growth/revision.

Tim,

   I wrote one about 20 years ago for whatever version of ACAD was then
current because I needed to put those drawings in a GIS. AutoDesk used to
change their proprietary format with each version so no one else could read
the data.

   Can your data source export them for you?

Indeed.  There was something called libdwg but I haven't kept up on that 
(now it's libredwg?) and dxf is another ball of lint entirely.  The dxf 
output from vectorsection is fairly capable, but I haven't looked at 
what it would take to hook libredwg into that.

I have a desktop computer, Lucid x86_64, which functions only to stream
internet radio, play movies, and serve as my backup to get on the net
in case I hopelessly screw up my laptop, which is my real computer.

So today I come home from a trying day at PSU only to discover that PGE
has provided me with yet another of their mini-outages (third one this
year). The laptop was still running, but the outage was sufficient to
kill the desktop and the stereo to which it is attached via Bluetooth.
"Bluetooth" in this case means a Logitech adapter that receives the
signal from the desktop computer's Bluetooth dongle and sends it out
to RCA jacks that plug into the magnetic phono input on the stereo.

Usually this is not a problem, I just flick the switch on the stereo and
reboot the desktop, and I'm back in business. However, today I could
not get the Bluetooth device between the desktop and the stereo to
connect. I also could not get my phone to connect to the device, nor
could my laptop. OK, power outage fried its little Logitech guts.
Maybe. Oh well. I'll fiddle with it some more later when I have more
energy. "I'll just connect the cable that I used to use before I bought
the Bluetooth device," I thought. The cable has an adapter that plugs
into the headphone jack on the back of the computer and terminates in
RCA plugs that go into the back of the stereo.

So I connect the cable, but no tunes. Nada. After much fiddling with
what pass for GUI sound controls in Lucid I decide to connect the cable
to my phone. No problem, sound gloriously streaming to the stereo,
thanks to TuneIn Radio app on Android and KQAC streaming radio.

There are also jacks on the front of the computer, but I can't get any
sound out of them either. 

I am using the audio on the ASUS M2NPV-VM motherboard, which lspci says
is "nVidia Corporation MCP51 High Definition Audio (rev. a2)."

Sound on this computer has always "just worked." It was working fine
this morning when I left the house. After rebooting it no longer works.

I need ideas for how to diagnose what is wrong. The only thing Lucid
gives me are System > Preferences > Sound and Applications > Sound and
Video > PulseAudio Volume Control. Neither is much help. Any
suggestions?

The specs say max capacity is 4 GB total memory.
Specs also say the machine "Supports DDR2 667, DDR2 533, or DDR2 400 MHz 
DIMMs.

I'll probably watch for 1 GB, 533 sticks and get two of those. I 
remember something about them wanting to be "matched" although I don't 
know what that really means. Is it just that the pairs need to be a 
match of size and speed? Or is there some other thing about them that 
can be matched?

I've seen that, too. IIRC, yesterday (Wednesday) I looked on Amazon and 
saw pairs of 1 GB sticks, as well as 2 GB sticks.

Thanks for the additional insights.

First off, check to see if the kernel still sees your sound chip.

    $ ls /proc/asound

should show you a "card0" directory, a symbolic link to card0
named NVidia, probably "oss" and "seq" directories, and an
assortment of regular files.  Assuming everything is there, do a 

    $ cat /proc/asound/cards

This should return something like:

     0 [NVidia         ]: HDA-Intel - HDA NVidia
                          HDA NVidia at 0xdeef8000 irq 22

If that's there, then you know that the kernel saw your sound
chip and loaded the driver module.  As far as it's concerned,
everything is just ducky.  (The address and IRQ number will
undoubtedly be different.) 

The next step is to fire up alsamixer, so:

$ alsamixer -c 0

(The "-c 0" tells alsamixer to use card 0.  This might not be
necessary, but then again, it might.)  You should have a nice
ncurses graphical set of mixer controls: Master, Headphone, PCM,
Front, Surround, and so on.  My guess here is that everything has
been muted -- alsa defaults to that state.  (You'll see "MM" at
the bottom of each control.)  Select the controls you want with
the arrow keys and hit "m" to un-mute them.  When you're done, hit
<esc>, and you should be good to go.

All that said, if you don't have the proper files in /proc/asound,
then you're going to have to do some more digging.  Look through
dmesg and /var/log/messages to see where things went wrong at
boot.  Given the nature of the power glitch, it's entirely
possible that something got changed in your BIOS settings.  If all
else fails, try booting into the BIOS setup.  I would set all
settings to their defaults, save, and exit.  Re-enter the BIOS
setup, change anything that needs to be changed to what you need
it to be, then save and exit again.  If all goes well, things
should Just Work.  (Uh-huh, where have I heard that before?)

Now before you say "that can't happen", I assure you it can.  It
happened to me, only in my case it was memory DIMM settings,
rather than the sound system.  And it used to happen all the time
at work.  So much fun getting a BSOD as soon as I turned on the
computer.  (That latter error turned out to be caused by a low
CMOS battery.  The motherboard drained it quite rapidly, and I'd
have to change it every couple of months.  Have you checked your
battery lately?)

Anyway, sorry for the wall 'o text, but I hope it helps.

Hi Dick,

The amount of hardware that would not be supported on AMD64 is getting
smaller and smaller in fact there are talks to make amd64 our default
.iso in 13.04 or no later than next LTS. You should be fine and the
benefits of running amd64 surely outweigh any reason for not using the
amd64 image.

I always suggest a clean install that way you do not have any lingering
Unity packages or dependencies.

Down to here everything produced the results as expected. The kernel

I selected "All" (F5). The only bar that is muted is the Mic, but I
remember doing that a long time ago, although I can't remember why I
did it. I never use the Mic on this computer anyway. I have the
following bars and values:

	Master		55
	Headphone	100<>100
	PCM		74<>74
	Front		100<>100
	Surround		100<>100
	Center		100
	LFE			100
	Line			0<>0
	CD			74<>74
	Mic			0<>0
	Mic Boost	0<>0
	Mic Boost	0<>0
	Phone		--------
	S/PDIF		MM
	S/PDIF D	00
	Beep		100
	Aux			MM
	Phono		55<>55

Note that I have had to turn the sound down lest I overload the input
on the stereo. That's why the Master is at 55. 

I might be better at troubleshooting this if I had more clues about
what all the above abbreviations stand for and what they do. 

>Anyway, sorry for the wall 'o text, but I hope it helps.

It helped a lot. At least now I know that the chip itself is working as
it is supposed to. Still a mystery why I'm not getting any output at
the jacks. Later today I'll rustle around the house and try to find an
old pair of standard PC speakers to plug in instead of using the input
to the stereo. 

I have been ignoring this computer for a very long time, including
updates to Ubuntu. I suppose I ought to just bite the bullet and wipe
it and then install 12.04 or something. 

Thanks for the pointers.

Google Translate says gem?tlichkeit is one of (in descending order
of likelihood):

* Coziness
* Friendliness
* Snugness
* Comfortableness (is that a word?)
* Unhurriedness

I guess all but snugness would fit... :-)

Depends on the day. I've been to some clinics that were pretty snug. But

It's been my experience that when I don't get a response it's because of 
one of two things. In spite of the depth and breadth of experience found 
on this list, once in awhile I throw out something screwy that no one 
else has see before, especially if it's about some rather unusual thing 
I'm trying to do.

At other times it just takes a few days before someone responds.

So, hang in there and keep up your own searching.

There's also the clinic, tomorrow. More effort may be expended if you're 
there in person.

BTW, I have no idea how to do what you're trying to do, but it seems 
like there should be some way to do it since it's common to boot from a 
CD and then get most of the rest of the install via the Internet.

So you are able to get to a grub interface from the DVD?

So once there have you found the syntax to boot from the USB stick?

I would imagine you would need a CDROM that had whatever driver to
load the Kernel from the USB stick.  Once the Kernel on the USB boots
it would be just a matter of passing it the right boot options.
Basically the ones loaded into the USB boot sequence.

So where are you on this or are you waiting or someone to say this is
how it is done?

So if said "Super" GRUB CD could see the USB drive and the kernel on
the USB drive works with your box then all you need is the right
options to pass from GRUB to the kernel.

Sorry I did not get an annoucement out in time, thank you John for
doing that.  I even thought up a theme:

"I have a DRAM" by MLK  ( Mary Louise Kludgehacker )

Maybe I will remember to do this next year.  See you fine people

Check out the grml-rescueboot option on this page
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/ISOBoot .  it will allow you to
boot from the I so image itself via grub.

Subject: [PLUG] sorting by filename, when there's stuff before and after
Message-ID: <1535982435.1298568.1358808458435.JavaMail.open-xchange@email.1and1.com>

Folks,

I'd appreciate a bit of help with a text search / sort.

I've searched through a repo with a bunch of .java files, listing text
associated with *.jsp files. As these are URLs, there's often text before and
after the *.jsp.

My objective is to set up a file with just the *.jsp filenames -- all the stuff
at least before the file name should be deleted on each line. (I can then sort
and compare with a different list of *.jsp filenames)

Examples in my target list:

"/path/to/file/abc.jsp";
some java declarative VARIABLE = "something.jsp";
* other/path/whatever.jsp
= "/path/to/file/other.jsp";
"/messy/path/abTestRest.jsp?metasomething=" +

Ideally, from whatever I run, I'd get the following output:

abc.jsp
something.jsp
whatever.jsp
other.jsp
abTestRest.jsp

Help will be appreciated.

(The comparison will tell me, for documentation purposes, which .jsp files are
less important for the app in question, and can be removed. I'd rather not go
into detail on the actual app.)

Thanks,
Mike

Assuming your original target list is in a file called file_list:

sed 's,.*[^A-Za-z]\(.*\.jsp\).*,\1,' file_list > extracted_list

E.g.:

#cat file_list
"/path/to/file/abc.jsp";
some java declarative VARIABLE = "something.jsp";
* other/path/whatever.jsp
= "/path/to/file/other.jsp";
"/messy/path/abTestRest.jsp?metasomething=" +

#sed 's,.*[^A-Za-z]\(.*\.jsp\).*,\1,' < file_list
abc.jsp
something.jsp
whatever.jsp
other.jsp
abTestRest.jsp

   I would write a short awk script that might look something like this:

BEGIN {FS="/"}; print {$4}

and run it:

   gawk -f script_name.awk > out.txt

   This assumes each file name is at the same subdirectory depth. 'gawk' is
the GNU version of 'awk' and either name will work just fine.

   You might need to pre- or post-process your file to fix the location
variations.

   Or, write a more complex awk script that uses conditionals; here's an
example of one of mine:

#! /usr/bin/gawk -f

# Replace zeros in data with the reporting level.
#  If two reporting levels, the higher one is used.

# Fields: site, sampdate, param, quant

BEGIN { FS = "|"; OFS = "|"}

{
     if ($3 ~ /Ag/ && $4 ~ /^0.000$/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-0.005|"; }
     else if ($3 ~ /Acid/ && $4 ~ /^0.000$/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-0.001|"; }
     else if ($3 ~ /Alk_Tot/ && $4 ~ /^0.000$/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-1.000|"; }
     else if ($3 ~ /Alk_OH/ && $4 ~ /^0.000$/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-1.000|"; }
     else if ($3 ~ /As/ && $4 ~ /^0.000$/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-0.010|"; }
   ...
     else { print $1, $2, $3, $4, "|" }
}

HTH,

Rich

David,

   Much more elegant than my awk approach. I'm not as fluent in sed as I am
in awk.

Thanks for the insight,

Rich

I like David's solution, and that's the general strategy I would try, but I
would use grep, which offers a friendly option "-o", a shorthand for what
he's trying to do:

egrep -o '[^/"]+\.jsp'

Folks,

I appreciate all of the help! None of the solutions were "perfect" as I
discovered (and did not think to provide) some probverbial "corner cases". For
my purposes, Scott's egrep -o solution worked best for me, as it made it easier
to see those corner cases, such as java servlet expressions, e.g.

import.javax.servlet.jsp.yadayada

The egrep -o solution led to

import.javax.servlet.jsp

which I immediately know isn't a file name

in contrast, the sed solution led to

servlet.jsp

which made me look for some servlet.jsp file that doesn't exist.

Thanks,
Mike

Subject: [PLUG] Creating a new launch item in Unity
Message-ID: <CAArUT0hQD3HzxtWPt_TWA2XE5Lhsptr8u2bBu8d_XXWCZU6R=A@mail.gmail.com>

I am beginning to understand people's dislike of Unity.  I use the
term dislike to be generous.

I upgraded to ubuntu 12.04, and am trying to use Unity.  Please
refrain from the cat-calls and I-told-you-sos.  Humor me.  Try to
help.

I want to create a new launch item in the launcher, specifically
gnome-terminal -e virtualbox.

The "help" says drag the icon of the application to the launcher.  OK.
 Create an icon.

Using Dash, I enter in the search bar "terminal".  I get two application
hits: Xterm and Uxterm.  Neither of them are gnome-terminal which is
what is launched using the "terminal" icon in the launch bar.  And a
search in Dash for gnome-terminal yields nothing.  Yet top shows
gnome-terminal to be running when I use that icon, and "which
gnome-terminal" shows /usr/bin/gnome-terminal.  wtf.

Also, I can launch but one terminal from the launcher.  I need to use
the first terminal to launch another.

So I guess I need to find some non-gui way to put something in the launcher.

I know most here know better than to use Unity, but if some brave soul
has some knowledge which might help, I would appreciate hearing it.

Thanks,
-Denis

Wow!. I'm free tomorrow night, and even walking distance. I don't

That would be awesome.  You can show up and not buy pitchers too, but
your idea is better. ;-)

Two things I hope can help

- Regards the terminal app, one can define a keyboard shortcut to invoke 
it. Go to system settings, then to keyboard, the second tab  should say 
"shortcuts". From there, the "launchers" group has a "terminal"  app for 
which  almost any keystroke  can be defined. This can also work  for any 
user-created app as well.

- Regards creating new launch items, I've found it useful to add the 
'alacarte' app from either synaptic (my preference) or the software  
store or apt-get.  This is the old *gnome2* menu editor, invaluable for 
adding new menu items or changing the default options on existing ones. 
Other than that, you must manually create or edit a new "desktop" file 
in the usr/share/applications or ~/.local/share/applications folders. 
Which is often too troublesome  for many  users

I found your pointing to usr/share/applications a help.  I copied
terminal to the desktop, edited the properties to invoke the command I
desired, then moved the icon on the desktop to the launcher.  Works,
but needs some cleaning up: icon change, control the launched terminal
behavior and size, etc.  I have yet to try the menu editor.  But this
is progress.

Thanks, Bill.  That link had a link to a Unity Tutorial which helps a
bit in understanding the rational of Unity.  It does not discuss
work-arounds for limitations of Unity.  I have not given up (yet) on
using Unity--I would like to have as close to a standard system as
possible so that the problems I encounter are more likely Ubuntu's
rather than mine.

You can have both.  If you install the fallback, you can select at logon

That's what I do.  Gnome Classic with no effects, or something.  It's usable.

If you would prefer, Ctl-Alt-t is the keyboard shortcut for the Terminal 
app.  I think it still works in Unity.

I get "terminal" as well, in Ubuntu 12.10.

After you launch a terminal, can you right click the resulting icon in the
launcher and select "Lock to Launcher"? You can also select "New Terminal"
with a right click...

Works in 12.10...

Was this of any help, or did you want the virtualbox argument as well, and
maybe even custom menu items for it? If so:

This thread is timely for me, as i finally got around to performing a
mind-wipe/clean install of Ubuntu 12.04 last weekend. i'd been using 10.10
since it first released (and many releases prior to 10), and a lot of the
3rd-party repos had stopped updates for it (got stuck on older Firefox &
Thunderbird). i figured i'd give Unity a try, even though i'm a bit of a
luddite and had grown really comfy in my highly customized Gnome2
environment(s) over the last seven or eight years.

i went into the effort well aware of the many complaints, and annoyed by
the new wave of Ubuntu fanboy-ism that rivals passionate Mac-o-philes and
seems to have sprung up in recent times (get offa my lawn!).

A few days in, and i'm surprised at how much i like it. Yes, i have to
hunt down and install some new "tweak" tools to customize the environment
in ways that Gnome2 supported out of the box, and i'm wary of just loading
my old Compiz settings, and the color scheme is gawd-awful, but it suits
my working style pretty well.

i've always relied on the keyboard more than the mouse, which usually just
slows me down. Gnome's keyboard access to the gui is great (and it's that
aspect of MS Windows that i prefer to the slavish mouse-dependency of Mac
OS X). i've grown quite dependent on Gnome-Do (a clone of the QuickSilver
utility for OSX) for learning my usage habits. So, im already fairly quick
at finding what i need in Unity by just typing away.

i don't like the "universal menu bar" glued to the top of the primary
display (similar to OS X), as it makes mousing the menus a longer trip
than when the menu bar is in the app window. Also, it seems like setting
the window-focus behavior to follow the mouse position rather than
clicking-to-focus causes problems with the proper menu appearing. And i
haven't tried it with multiple displays.

i still have plenty of tweaking to do and tools to reinstall (not looking
forward to reinstalling the JVMs i need for development & testing), but
i'm liking it a lot more than i thought i would. Once i get it tuned i
plan to add Gnome Shell and give that a try as well.

It seems that an Android virtual machine can run inside Virtualbox.
Which suggests that Android apps can run in a virtual machine on a
laptop, and that I don't have to buy an Android tablet or phone to
use some apps and services without native Linux implementations.
An example is gotomeeting.com

Maybe.

Is anyone here running virtualized Android?  What opportunities
and limitations have you encountered?  I'd guess the main problem
is lack of a touchscreen; perhaps you can fake one finger with
the mouse, but not two.  I also imagine DRM gets in the way.

Great link!  The Android X86 port appears "not ready for prime
time", given the ARM processor focus of Android.  Perhaps Intel
will work on that.

There are some interesting hardware dongle options, like the
MK802 II ($37 from Amazon) with HDMI output - can't drive a
laptop with that, but it probably can drive a desktop monitor
through an adapter.  I'm guessing the hacker community will be
all over this, and there will be lots more options in a year or so.

So I'll stop worrying about it for now.

Until a few months ago, I used the images from androvm.org for testing
during android development.  I got adb working through a bridged network,
so I could do some rudimentary testing and debugging.  It is a fast Android
box when run on a youthful Mac Book Pro, much better than the emulator.  It
has plenty of quirks, but I easily found enough that worked to get on with
my job.  Other more real world android devices are now available to me, so
I no longer use Androvm.

Androvm may well work for what you want, but it will take some fiddling to
find out for sure.  You will have to load Google Play separately, as I
recall.

Let us know what you find out.

The X86 port is ready for prime time. It is on shipping phones in the UK,
China, and India.  There is a translation layer that will convert ARM to
x86 on the fly. (I have seen it run on many test phones and tablets in the
lab on the current version of Android.)

If you are going to run a virtual emulation of Android, you should use the
one that comes with the Android SDK. It builds for either ARM emulation or
X86.

Phones on x86 will be in the US soon. (It takes longer to get a phone to
market in the US, as well as some carrier related issues.) How soon I am
not certain. I live too far in the future and they don't tell me when it
ships.

I may be able to do a presentation on X86 and Android, but I would have to
clear it through legal first. (I have signed many NDAs.)

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1301240930310.11919@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Not sure anyone here can help on this, but I'll ask with the hope that
someone can.

   I need to be able to print envelopes on my LJ5 from a file created by
LibreOffice-3.5.5.3. I created the envelope template in 2003 with whatever
version of OO.o was then available. It worked until OO.o was supplanted by
LO; hasn't worked since and it's time for me to resolve this issue.

   Part of the problem is most likely within LO and I've just subscribed to
that mail list to ask for help from them on why, when I try to print the
envelope directly to the printer, CUPS doesn't move the bits to the printer
because the rastorizer fails.

   Trying an alternate route I print to a .pdf file. When I try to print the
file using lpr, the printer gets all upset because the paper size is not
expected. I can print the file to an 8.5x11 inch sheet of paper, but not to
a commercial size 10 envelope. It's the latter that confuses the printer.

   Do I need to manually set the printer for the envelope? I assumed that the
paper size and orientation was sent to the printer with the document, but
since the image on a letter-size page is centered rather than on the left
(but it is in landscape mode) perhaps the paper sensor is missing the
envelope so it just feeds through with a nice curl to it.

   Any thoughts?

My first thought is that over many years of printing with Windows and
Linux to various laser printers the one thing that is a constant PITA
is getting the page orientation right. The cause of this problem is
that there are three programs telling the printer what to do: The
program inside the printer, the application on your computer that you
are printing from, and the printer driver and how you have set it up on
your computer. I swear that even when I am careful to make sure that
all three are saying the same thing I still get unexpected results. And
for some reason PDF files are the worst. PDF files are so bad that I
always print just the first page to make sure that the orientation is
right before I send the entire file. 

As for specifically printing envelopes, I would start by making sure
that the driver lists #10 envelope as an option. If not (or even if it
does) you need a different driver. I have a LJ4+ and there are so many
different drivers available for it that it makes me dizzy. I imagine
the LJ5 is the same, since these printers are very popular in spite of
their age. 

I never print envelopes on my LJ4+ because I find the curl
unacceptable. Instead, I created an envelope template where the
inside address is positioned perfectly for a window envelope. But I did
try printing envelopes a few times before giving up and, if I recall
correctly, I had to move the sliders in the manual tray to feed the
envelope in the center. Looking at the manual tray on my LJ4+ just now
I see the Avery label I placed on it marking the position is still
there, together with instructions to myself "feed print side
up" (another PITA that is easy to mess up).

I don't know why the rasterizer is not sending the job to the printer,
but there ought to be some error messages somewhere. I would check the
usual suspects, starting with var/log/messages.

John,

   At a time in the not-too-distant past something changed, perhaps in CUPS,
and it took a couple of mis-prints to learn that rather than feeding pages
face up leading with the top (e.g., laser business checks), I needed to feed
them face down and toe first. Shrug. So that's what I learned to do.

   There are options in LO that I have not explored. The default is
left-right, top-bottom. Perhaps that needs to be changed. I'll go play with
this after I resolve the problem of not being able to print directly from LO
since the pstorastorizer fails. Sigh.

   With so much business communications being sent as .pdf attachments to
e-mail messages I rarely send a snail-mail letter anymore. That's true for
most of us which is one reason the USPS keeps asking for more money for
postage.

   Regardless, when I do write letters I use LaTeX; LyX, actually. Years ago
I modified the KOMA-Script letter2 document class to produce a US-standard
business letter rather than the default German standard. I just learned how
to modify that for the LyX-2.x versions. With minor tweaking of position,
the recipients name and address appear in the envelope window, just like my
A/P checks do. So, now that I know this I don't need to futz with LO in
printing envelopes. But, I'd still like to fix that just in case.

Thanks,

Rich

Wait... it went from face up to face down printing? This doesn't sound
possible without changing printers. Am I missing (or misunderstanding)
something?

Wait... How would a change in the driver change the side of the paper the printer prints on??? That's a physical change...

Rick,

   Probably. It's the same LJ-5 I bought in 1997 with the last duplexer
available in the country, extra RAM, a PostScript card, and a JetDirect
card.

   Printing was done 'normally' with WordPerfect/Linux until that died in
2000, then from within OpenOffice.org. But, at some point it changed and I
have no recollection of whether this was a distribution upgrade, switching
from Red Hat to Slackware, CUPS being bought by Apple, or something else.
All I know is that I need to feed checks and labels feet first and on their
bellies to get the printing on the proper side and orientation. This is
using the manual feed tray because otherwise I don't load the paper tray
correctly and waste forms. Anything else, printed from the internal paper tray
on plain paper, comes out correctly because both sides of the paper are
blank going in.

Russell,

   This brings to mind there were major driver changes some time in the past.
May well have been the cause. Regardless, since this affects only
pre-printed forms and special paper like labels, I just put them in the
manual feed tray and they come out properly.

Was curious about this as I've never tried to print onto an envelope with
my HPLJ 2100TN.  Just tried it and it worked fine using the following:

- OpenOffice.org Writer
	- Format>Page...>Page
	   "Page Style" = "#10 Envelope"
	   "Orientation" = "Landscape"

	- File>Print...>Printer Properties...>Paper
	   "Paper Size" = "Envelope #10"
	   "Orientation" = "Portrait"


Other than reducing the margins a bit for esthetics it just worked.  I
used the side-feed with the envelope centered, facing up, with its top
to the left.

Here's my CUPS driver info:

Envelope printing:

The situation for printing envelopes has never been good;
I suspect the people who write the programs don't use postal
mail, or use european sized envelopes.

I've used HP postscript printers for over a decade, so I
finally buckled down and wrote the postscript for printing
a simple envelope (yes, raw postscript).  And starting with
a postscript file for a different recipient, I text edit
the file to make a new file with some of the fields replaced.

It works well enough for me that I haven't even bothered to
make a little Perl script that I can just feed an address.
That would be handy, because when I use different printers,
I need to change the X and Y offsets in the postscript file,
and sometimes I change the quantities, so I can print out
multiple envelopes to a recurring recipient like my business
partners or my accountant.

The more "interesting" trick is printing labels.  I have a
few files with "for" loops in them.  Again, perhaps better
done with a Perl script and a config file.  I've even put
in pixel maps and vector graphics for logos. 

Here's an envelope example:
- - - - - - - - - - - cut here - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

/#copies 1 def

Postscript is a weird but understandable programming language.  You
can also feed it into CUPS and print to non-Postscript printers.

I don't suggest this to everyone, but it does point out that there
are very simple ways to get these tasks done.  Rowboats, instead of
giant aircraft carrier programs like Libre Office that do everything
... poorly.

BTW, one last thing - envelopes outgas when they go through the
fuser, and build up deposits that eventually mess up the rollers.
If you do envelopes, plan on tearing the machine down and cleaning
or replacing the fuser after a few thousand envelopes.  There are
probably brands of envelopes that don't do this, but no envelope
maker will tell you that their envelopes have this problem.

Keith,

   Also, strangely enough, HP no longer has (if they ever had) a driver for
the LJ 5; they do for 5L, 5M, etc. but not the basic 5. Despite their
building printers that last (at least, they used to do this) they drop
support for them to encouraga folks to dump a perfectly good printer and buy
a new one.

   What a great idea! I have a book on PostScript and regularly use PSTricks
(which embeds PostScript in LaTeX) for vector drawings.

   I used OO.o to set up pages of labels and saved them as .pdf files. I have
return address labels for home and business and shipping labels. These I
print with lpr from the command line.

   Thanks! This I'll make work on my printer. Since I print envelopes so
infrequently, and always one at a time, this will do the job.

   I have a PS module in my LJ5.

   Allow me to introduce you to LyX <http://www.lyx.org/>. I very recently
read a comment from a LaTeX/LyX user who shares my views on LyX rather than
LaTeX: the difference is similar to coding in C or Python versus coding in
assembly language. I do 95% of my writing with LyX and insert raw LaTeX as
needed.

   Interestingly enough, until this past month I never had a client or agency
complain about the appearance of a TeX-compiled typeset document. One
client, who has to satisfy more senior management at the offices in a small
(1,400 people) northeastern Washington town, had me modify the appearance so
it would look more like a Word document! Sigh. They are rather provincial in
that office.

CUPS handles the translation from internal Postscript to the native
PJL language as well.  The question is what level of Postscript?
1? 2? 3?  Some of the newer pdf viewers expect to talk to a newer
version of Postscript.  I guess programmers buy newer equipment
than we do.  In any case, sometimes the solution is to use PJL and
translate through CUPS.  I expect that doesn't handle manual feed
for envelopes, though.

The reason for the "for" loops is that I can use one copy of the
content (typically inside a "def") and then loop it in X and Y,
making tweaks on the spacing in the loop, not moving stuff around
on a screen.  If I use different labels with a different size or
pitch, I can adjust scale, spacing, and offsets with a few parameters.
I can use the same geometry for different contents.  For example,
here is a script that prints alternating columns of two different
labels on sheets of 5x22 (I have a lifetime supply):

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Cut Here - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
%!PS-Adobe-2.0
%% 1.685 by 0.5 inch, 5 by 22 labels

%% /#copies 12 def
%% statusdict begin /manualfeed false def 3 setpapertray end

0 1 4 { 121.6 mul dup 0 2 22 { 36.4 mul gsave translate

/Helvetica-Bold findfont 13 scalefont setfont
12.0 12.0 moveto (Wilma Flintstone) show
14.0 48.4 moveto  (Fred Flintstone) show

/Helvetica-Bold findfont 8 scalefont setfont
44.0  4.0 moveto (503-555-1212) show
44.0 40.4 moveto (503-555-1212) show

grestore dup    } for pop    } for
showpage
^D
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Cut Here - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Stack languages like Postcript make my head hurt, but this script
just-sorta-evolved from simpler forms.  I calibrated the "121.6"
and "36.4" starting with the alleged 72 dpi of the printer
and the alleged 1.685 x 0.5 inch spacing of the labels,
then tweaked the numbers until things were exactly lined up. 
Now I can use the same spacing for different label content.

I recently changed my black-and-white printing from a venerable
HP4M to an HP4050 with a duplexer.  I probably need to recalibrate
my spacings.  Time to write that Perl script!   I could go crazy
fancy and make it a CGI back-end for a moinmoin wiki page.  
Then I could go down a list of addresses or contents on the house
wiki and click a few to generate a page of labels.  This might be
good for Christmas package mailings.  And terrible for support if
I pre-decease (or pre-gork) my wife.

Ah well.  Though I live in vi, there is probably an emacs macro
for this.

   True. But when I bought the LJ5 in 1997 we did not yet have CUPS; I forget
the tool we were using then.

   Shrug. Certainly not the latest.

   Or, you find the Avery equivalent and use that to define the page layout
in LO. After filling in one label, click the box that synchronizes all
labele to the first one and you're good to go.

   Tweaking at the sub-millimeter level is why I like LaTeX. I created a form
to use with my optical card reader (OCR) that requires very precise locating
and spacing of rows, columns, and rectangles. Then I had the forms printed
in two colors (black and red) and they work just fine.

   It has been written that emacs is the only editor that comes with a
built-in operating system. :-)

   I wrote my dissertation using a line-oriented text editor, TDP (Text and
Document Processor) running on an HP-3000. (Printed on an electronic
typewriter feeding each page in by hand.) Having lines truncated if I did
not press [Return] at the right point, getting out of 'add' mode to 'edit'
or 'del' mode permanenly turned me off to line-oriented editors. Gimme' the
good ol' page editors emacs and joe and I'm set to work.

After reading some of the various sites recommended, I am still in a
state of confusion (maybe more-so).

I created a desktop configuration file using an option in Virtual box:
create a short-cut file on the desktop.  It shows as an icon and it
works.  The command listed in the properties window is
/usr/lib/virtualbox/VirtualBox --comment "Win2kSP2" --startvm
"b2431776-771e-4972-8f49-a96aed2d2c4f".  It launches just what I want.

I can drag this icon to the launcher and mark it lock to Launcher.
However, if I move the icon from the desktop to Home or delete it the
icon disappears from the Launcher.

One suggestion was to place a desktop configuration file for my
desired application in  ~/.local/share/applications.  I moved it to
this folder.  But I noticed that only one of the desktop configuration
files in this folder have the execute bit set.  I duplicated the
setting for my file.  It now appears in Dash when I search, but only
as "Applications" without the appropriate name.  The other file with
the execute bit set is Alsa-mixer, and that appears upon a search as
Applications with the name Alsa-mixer.

All this comes from what I see in Nautilus( 3.4.2).  In a terminal I
see that Nautilus hides the real file names. The Alsa-mixer file is
"alacarte-made.desktop".  Nautilus says the name is AlsaMixer, as does
the properties window.

The alacarte-made.desktop file contains:
#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open

[Desktop Entry]
Exec=gnome-terminal -e alsamixer
Icon=gnome-panel-launcher
Icon[en_US]=gnome-panel-launcher
Name=AlsaMixer
Name[en_US]=AlsaMixer
NoDisplay=false
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Version=1.0

My desktop file contains:

[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Version=1.0
Name=Win2kSP2
Comment=Starts the VirtualBox machine Win2kSP2
Type=Application
Exec=/usr/lib/virtualbox/VirtualBox --comment "Win2kSP2" --startvm
"b2431776-771e-4972-8f49-a96aed2d2c4f"
Icon=virtualbox-vbox.png

I have not explored how my file interacts with the Launcher yet.

Other than flushing Unity, what do you suggest?  And is  Nautilus'
behavior of hiding the file names well known, or is that a "feature"
added by Unity?

Subject: [PLUG] Failed Go-Flex hard drive
Message-ID: <20130127175009.3f5fc650@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I have a Seagate 3TB Go-Flex USB 3.0 hard drive that has apparently
failed. It still spins up, the light comes on, but none of the GUI file
managers on Fedora or Ubuntu can display the contents. They give me the
error message "Failed to open directory 'Movies'. Error when getting
information for /media/Movies/moviefilename."

The contents are old movies that I continue to seed. I noticed the
other day that Ktorrent was complaining about a couple of them missing
pieces, and I started worrying then. But otherwise it continued to
function until just now when I returned home after taking my computer
to PSU. The Go-Flex is connected to a USB port on the laptop dock, so
as soon as I place the computer in the dock it is recognized. I have to
mount it before I start Ktorrent, and now after mounting it appears
mounted, but I can't read the contents. This happens on both my laptop
and my desktop, using various USB ports, and after wiggling connections.

I opened Palimpsest, which reported the Smart information as "Disk has
a few bad sectors." I unmounted it and ran "e2fsck -p /dev/sdb" which
reported "Bad magic number in superblock while trying to open /dev/sdb:
The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2
filesystem." (It is ext4.) The error message further suggested to run
"e2fsck -b 8193 <device>." I have not tried this as I have no idea what
this will do. 

It is not the end of the world if I lose everything on the disk (about
10 GB), but it would be annoying. And it is under warranty. But I could
use some suggestions for things I can try with e2fsck or other tools
before I give up. Any experts out there?

The -b option to e2fsck tells it to use an alternate superblock,
this one at location 8193.  When an ext2/3/4 filesystem is
created, is builds several spare superblocks, just in case one
goes bad.  This sounds like such a situation.  In fact, I would do

    # e2fsck -b 8193 -fpDC 0 /dev/sdb

The options tell it to: use the alternate super(b)lock at 8193;
(f)orce the filesystem check, just in case the system thinks the
filesystem is clean; "(p)reen" the filesystem (i.e., correct what
it can without manual intervention); check and index the
(D)irectories; and (C) display a progress bar to tell you how far
it's gone.  The -D option rarely needs to be done, but in this
case, I think it might be a good idea.

You should check out the man pages for e2fsck(8), mkext2(8), and
tune2fs(8).  You might find them a bit dense, but it's good
information to know.  If you have questions, well, you know where
to ask.  :-)

I like to run fsck on all my filesystems every once in a while.
Since my desktop system is up 24/7, it's run automatically
whenever the system is booted.  Given that I only reboot when the
kernel is replaced, or some other major change, it doesn't happen
very often.  I do the same with my laptop, mostly because I don't
trust the thing farther than I could dropkick my house.  My USB
drives are not added at bootup, since I take them from place to
place (especially my music drive).  So I check them manually, once
every week or so.  The command I use is

    # e2fsck -fpC 0 /dev/sdn

where "n" is the drive number.  Very seldom does anything go
wrong, but every once in a great while, something does, as you've
just found out.

Hope this helps.

Sounds like your partition table got borked from a bad eject/umount.  if 
thats it, you can repair it.  There might be a few bad files, though, 
since you tried to keep using the drive.  Also, you might have a bad 
enclosure.  If it happens again, then a warranty swap might be in order.

Easiest, if you have a backup of the data, is to reformat.  Since it is 
3TB, I suggest setting up several partitions instead of just one big 
one.  Useful utilities (live distros also handy if your system wont boot):

http://partedmagic.com
http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php

Both include numerous harddrive and other diagnostic tools, such as 
testdisk.  Testdisk is an excellent utility to recover partitions.

Bad superblock issues pop up often.  Before you get too deep, you can 
try something simple.  You can try to load one of the back up 
superblocks, there are several backup.  Which one you use will depend on 
your block size (8193 the superblock location for 1K blocks).  Your 3TB 
drive is no doubt formated with 4K blocks (4096 bytes).

find superblock locations:
|# dumpe2fs /dev/sda3 | grep superblock|

find block size:
|# dumpe2fs /dev/hda2 | grep 'Block size'|

Tried it. Same error messages. :(

Might there be other spare superblocks I could ask it to use?

I did check out the man page for e2fsck, but most of it was over my
head. I have used tune2fs to find a UUID, but will check out its man
page and the man page for mkext2 as well.

Another question: When the error message says "a correct ext2
filesystem," is it using "ext2" as a generic term for "any ext
filesystem"? I ask because I know the filesystem is ext4, therefore the
error message confuses me. Like "of course it's not a valid ext2
filesystem, stupid computer! It's an ext4 filesystem!"

Thanks for the suggestions. :)

A bad umount is certainly a possibility.

I have no backup. But the only things on the drive are old movies. I
could re-download them, so I never bothered to worry about backups.
Still, it would be a pain in the neck to have to download them all over
again.

Registrars only manage second-level domains within the com., org., or 
whatever namespace.

It's up to the owners of the domains (you.com) to manage its namespace 
(portland.you.com, seattle.you.com).

Why /dev/sdb instead of /dev/sdbN, where N is the partition number? 
Your disk is almost certainly partitioned.  This means that your 
filesystem lives within a partition.  When you used /dev/sdb, you 
referred to the whole disk.  Thus e2fsck did not recognize any 
filesystem.  I suggest using the following command to find out how the 
disk is partitioned.

sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb

Thanks to the help from Dale, Galen and King Beowulf the drive is now
functioning normally and I have copied all the files to another drive.

I assumed that my next step would be to take the drive to the nearest
Seagate store and throw it through their front window. I came to this
conclusion because after fixing the superblock I had to run a manual
e2fsck, which rewrote a dozen blocks and fixed lots of inodes and
whatnot. 

However, Palimpsest now says the drive is healthy. Looking at the Smart
data in detail everything looks fine (although I don't understand the
numbers), except for Airflow Temperature, which merely says it has
failed in the past. Everything else is a lovely green color.

So now I'm wondering if the drive really is OK. Maybe it just got
goobered up by being unplugged without unmounting first. (I have
not followed the best practices here.) The warranty is only two years,
and I've had it for a year or so. And if you ask Mr. Google, these
drives have a high failure rate.

Seagate's web site has a diagnostic utility, but 1) I'm sure it only
runs on Windows and, 2) I bet it just reads the Smart data. If the
latter, it would announce that the drive is fine and Seagate would try
to weasel out of the warranty. 

Are there any Linux disk utilities that will really stress the drive to
make sure it is really OK?

I think you're wise to be cautious.  OTOH, unplugging without unmounting 
is definitely an invitation for disk corruption.

I assume you're referring to SeaTools.  IIRC, SeaTools is an image that 
you boot.  No Windows required.  It is capable of more than just reading 
the smart data.  In order to do a warranty return, I think they will 
want you to run it.  I believe it's non-destructive as well, at least 
when run in its default mode.  Of course you should confirm this for 
yourself.

Not sure about this.  I'd give SeaTools a try.

Your name is only a mapping to a number (which the filesystem uses),
the UID (likewise the group: GID).  It sounds like you have different
UID/GID's on the two systems.  Look in /etc/passwd on each one and
find your name.

Here are the relevant lines from /etc/passwd on each system:

These look fine, anyway.

You may also try the pwck 
<http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/pwck8.html> and grpck 
<http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/grpck8.html> commands on each 
machine, to ensure that your passwd, group, shadow and gshadow files are 
self-consistent. These can correct many, but not all, inconsistencies.

Does your /etc/group contain an entry for GID 1000 (as referenced above, 
in your passwd file)?

Most distros have smartmontools either installed or available:
http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/opensource/using-smartctl-to-get-smart-status-information-on-your-hard-drives/1389
smartd/smartctl lets you see what the smart data says.

In Ubuntu you can access this via:
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/37659/the-beginners-guide-to-linux-disk-utilities/

A destructive test tool available in most distros is "badblocks" that 
will write data to the drive to test for errors: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badblocks
You can run a destructive badblocks test for a day and see if errors in 
the platter get remapped and/or flagged by SMART.

Failing drives often put stuff in /var/messages, and /dmesg.  

Also, the GoFlex is small and warm when doing a lot of work.
Might the drive have spent some not-quite-so-quality time
underneath a warmth-seeking cat?

I didn't check that, but the current problem is under control. No data
loss. The only remaining question is whether it needs to be replaced
under warranty.

No possibility of that. The cats never get on the desk/table. Their
feet are often muddy and I would be able to tell. Besides, this drive
resided between the desktop monitor and the printer. It always had
several centimeters of free space around it, but not enough room for a
cat to snuggle up to it. Plus, they seem to avoid the computers. I have
a theory that the computers emit sound at a frequency that they do not
like. Either that or they instinctively know that if they sit on the
computers the big human will hit them.

I think the likelihood is the way I used it caused the problems. I seed
some of my favorite old movies via torrent on the laptop 24/7. But when
it is time to take the laptop elsewhere I shut down Ktorrent, then
other running applications, and finally shut down the laptop. But I do
not ordinarily umount the drive before shutting down the computer,
although I always wait until the computer is completely shut down
before removing it from its dock. If Fedora's shutdown procedure did
not wait until the drive was finished it is possible that this caused
the problems. 

On the other hand, maybe it is really failing. :(

This weekend I will try some of the utilities that King Beowulf and
others suggested and see what happens. I will also dig out my receipts
to see exactly when I bought it.

Shutdown unmounts all disks, so it's unlikely that is the source of the 
problems.  If that's what you always do, then the disk might be failing. 
  OTOH, if you suspend your laptop and then undock, I'm not sure whether 
that's okay or not.  I don't know what happens to disks during a suspend.

Message-ID: <1359513302.3823.37.camel@kauai>

Folks,

I never thought I'd see it. But Alan Cox doesn't like Fedora 18:

https://plus.google.com/111104121194250082892/posts/aCiB7kTLXTh

"So Fedora 18 seems to be the worst Red Hat distro I've ever seen.

The new installer is unusable, the updater is buggy. When you get it
running the default desktop has been eviscerated to the point of being
slightly less useful than a chocolate teapot, and instead of fixing the
bugs in it they've added more."

And to add a bit to the previous discussion of Linus:

https://plus.google.com/111104121194250082892/posts/KW3TdRYwjr9

"I'm leaving the Linux world and Intel for a bit for family reasons. I'm
aware that "family reasons" is usually management speak for "I think the
boss is an asshole" but I'd like to assure everyone that while I
frequently think Linus is an asshole (and therefore very good as kernel
dictator) I am departing quite genuinely for family reasons and not
because I've fallen out with Linus or Intel or anyone else. "

Thanks,
Mike

Subject: [PLUG] Working with a Canon MP620 printer
Message-ID: <5109AF40.6070100@comcast.net>

I received an old winders system from some friends who switched to Apple 
products. Included is a Canon MP620 printer/scanner. It has a network 
interface on it, so I plugged it in to the home network. On the little 
screen on the printer I can see that the device obtained an IP address 
from my router, and I can see the MAC address. I don't find any way to 
set a fixed IP address. In fact, I don't find too much useful 
information about the printer. I find information about using it with 
winders and Mac machines, but not much useful related to using it on a 
Linux machine.

I'm not too concerned about being able to print to it since I am happy 
printing to one of my laser printers. But I would like to try the 
scanner on the thing.

Does anyone have experience with this printer? Most of what I've found 
on the web talks about how it didn't work, or how it can work for an 
older version of Ubuntu than I'm using, (10.04 and 12. 04).

Clue sticks are appreciated.

Thanks.

Thanks. I'll put some time into making the printer part work, later.

Meanwhile, I didn't pay close enough attention to what xsane was telling 
me earlier. I'm used to getting a message from xsane on my Ubuntu 10.04 
machine telling me it couldn't find a scanner when I'd for gotten to 
turn it on, and/or hadn't done a SCSI rescan after rebooting. The 
version of xsane on that machine is 0.996. When I started up xsane on my 
Ubuntu 12.04 machine I saw a similar small window and assumed it had the 
same problem. However, that little window went dim for a long period of 
seconds -- probably 30 seconds or so -- and then several xsane windows 
opened. What I didn't pay attention to was the one that had a window 
title of, "Standard Options Canon PIXMA MP620:MP620". (Not sure if there 
is anything following the second iteration of MP620 since it's up 
against the right edge of the window's title bar, and the window is of a 
fixed size.)

Anyway, I put something on the scanner and xsane scanned it.

The version of xsane on Ubuntu 12.04 is 0.998. It must include something 
in it that isn't in version 0.996 that allows it to find the network 
scanner.

So, success with scanning, and more to pursue on printing.

Thanks for the link. It showed me that xsane was up to 1.20 back in 
2009, even though Ubuntu is still only at 0.998 today. (I installed 
xsane on the 12.04 machine this afternoon.)
