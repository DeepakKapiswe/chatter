      The Open Source Development Lab (www.osdl.org) is an industry
      sponsored lab with data centers in Portland, Oregon and
      Yokohama, Japan.  The lab sponsors key industry projects,
      including industry initiatives to enhance Linux for use in
      corporate data centers (Data Center Linux) and in
      telecommunications networks (Carrier Grade Linux).
      Timothy D. Witham is the lab's director.  He will give a
      general overview of the lab and it's activities and what
      it can offer to Open Source developers.  I suppose he
      will also talk about Linus Torvalds' decision to take a
      position with the lab.

Subject: [PLUG] Problems using X with ssh from one particular site.
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0306282057180.2494-100000@sco302.DavidMandel.com>

I'm having a bit of a problem describing my problem, but here goes ...

I have a couple computers in Vancouver and one in Corvallis, which is
access remotely using something like:

                  ssh -X Vancouver-1
                  ssh -X Vancouver-2
                  ssh -X Corvallis

This has always worked.  No matter where I happen to be, given a Linux
machine and internet access, I seem to be able to access the three
machines.  This access includes the ability to run X applications like
xclock, emacs, and gimp over the net.

NOW THE PROBLEM:  I was at a company in Springfield today.  I couldn't
find a Linux machine, but I booted a Knoppix CD on one of their Windows
machines and everything looked fine, except I was able to access
Vancouver-1, Vancouver-2, and Corvallis using ssh - BUT	I COULDN'T
RUN X APPLICATIONS.  Everytime I tryed to start one, I got a message
about not being able to access the X server.  Anyone know why I'm
having this problem?  The display variable looks reasonable.  I would
say that the firewall is blocking me, but X should be being tunneled
thru ssh and ssh is working fine; so I don't see how this could be
causing the problem.

                                          Sincerely,
                                          David Mandel

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0307010204140.13939-100000@ns1.billmercer.com>

Hey Pluggers--I usually use xfce as my desktop, but recently I've been 
attempting to learn java, and unfortunately java proggies appear at the 
top of the screen with the title bar off the screen.  Using 
Gnome/Enlightenment works fine, but this is an old, slow machine and I 
don't like the overhead (I know, it's pointless to run java apps on a 
machine this slow, but it's the only thing I've got to learn on).  

Is there anything I can do to force java proggies to appear in a more 
normal position under xfce?  Incidently, the sawmill window manager has 
the same #&@$ing problem.

Bill

Portland, OR.  I'm cc this to the Portland Linux Users Group (PLUG) as
they've been the people in the know when I've had questions.  I found a
nice little hotel downtown from their referrals.

PLUGers there be OSCON attendees dreading modem speed connections while 
attending.  Are there any wireless options at the Marriot or elsewhere 
downtown?

Unfortunately the case is locked by the IT staff, so I've just 
disabled the bell under vim and bash, which seems to cover everything so
far.

The good news is apparently newer versions of cygwin use the audio card 
for a bell by default instead.

Btw, is it true that back in the day the computer would actually ring a bell 
(like a firebell?) when you made a mistake at the terminal? (No wonder people 
used to be afraid of computers!)

Some of them use mini-CDs, which make them pocket-sized, of course
those disks probably have less storage.

I understand the Neuros (http://open.neurosaudio.com) is the only mp3 
player that officially supports linux, with plans for FreeBSD. They've 
also contracted with Xiph.org to support Ogg, with beta firmware 
available here:

http://www.xiph.org/neurosetta/

All software used for Neuros is also available under a BSD-style 
license, according to their social contract:

Well, sort of. The bell was a mechanical bell built into the teletype
machine which was all we had for a terminal.

ide1 is most likely your cdrom drive, and you switched disks.

It shouldn't explode anytime soon, but I did see some nice pictures of a
guy using a Dremel tool to exceed the structural integrity of a cd via
extreme rotational acceleration...

Just an FYI, our Pioneer Courthouse Square node is currently in
transition to a new sponsor. I hope that it will be up in time for this
but it might not be live yet by next week. 

South Park Blocks, Heaven Cafe, and The Rose and Raindrop great downtown
Community Wireless nodes. I will try and post any other updates
regarding downtown nodes before and during OSCON (I'll be there all
week).. At one time there was talk of helping to provide APs for OSCON
but I actually don't know the status of that right now. I will try and
find out soon.

Message-ID: <33056.68.107.223.201.1057077076.squirrel@webmail.pdxlug.org>

I'm parsing HTML with Perl and I'm trying to develop a regular expression
to handle an unknown number of text fields between <SPAN> tags.  I want to
then combine all the text fields into one variable.  Here's what I have so
far:

($text) = /((<SPAN.*?>((.*)(<SPAN.*?>|<\/SPAN.*?>)))+?)/;

I'm hoping to then use regex backreferences somehow to pull out the fields
between the <SPAN> tags.

Any suggestions?
Thanks,
~M

I don't have the time to search right now, but there's got to be a
module on CPAN that'll do the HTML parsing for you...

That's exactly what I'm asking for here - courtesy for those involved in
both groups. As for the "why" go back and read the posting you're

Hmmmm. Because PLUG has had that name for close to ten years? You guys
split off because you wanted to differentiate yourselves from PLUG - and
then chose the same name, a very similar domain name, and the same meeting
time. You're failing to differentiate.

So give them a clear choice - don't muddy the waters.

If you read my posting, you'll see I never complained about your choice to
start your own group. You're free to have your own group and run it the
way you please. My only complaint is with the confusion you have created
by using our old name, picking a similar domain name, etc. When you do
that sort of thing, you start impacting the function of *our* group. We
have worked hard to establish a sort of name-brand-familiarity, which you
are diluting.

Once again, we have had the name for close to ten years. If you want to
offer people choice, give them choice - not confusion. If you want to
differentiate yourselves from PLUG - do so. The current situation benefits
no one.

The whole thing is starting to sound like it's straight out of a
Monty Python movie: "Portland Linux/Unix Group? Cawk! We're the Portland
Linux User's Group!"

I don't know how to do it under cygwin specifically but in win2K you can
shut it off for the entire machine by disabling it under the device
manager, does NT have a device manager?  (it's been about 4 years since
I've been on an NT box)

Message-ID: <E19X3wv-0007Af-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

I have asked about this before, but since there was a version of 802.11g 
drivers released for FreeBSD (CURRENT-5) last weekend, I am wondering when 
there will be 802.11g drivers for Linux.. Any help? I really don't want to use 
FreeBSD when I have just got into Linux a lot..

Also, does anyone have a 802.11b PCI card they would like to sell. I think that 
if I cannot get 802.11g working under Linux, I will install FreeBSD-CURRENT-5 
on one of my boxes (A server, P2/400) and use 802.11g with it and then 802.11b 
with my box.

This question has crossed 3 lists that I'm on in various forms (datetime, pdx.pm, plug) and probably a few others.  Maybe an out of town geek page would be a good idea?  I'd volunteer to do it but I count as out of town now. :)

Things to list:

hotels with connectivity
links to the freenode/personaltelco pages
a map of powells and powells tech. books
the GPS coords of important locations (book stores, hotels, coffee shops, bars..)
links to local movie listings - including the McWorldDomination's pages
the laser light shows at OMSI
anything else that might interest a geek

Sound like a good idea?

I think it is pretty clear that PDXLUG's attitude about the confusion
they are causing puts them unambiguously in the "splitter" camp.

To paraphrase their response to the thread on their mailing list: "yes
we are causing confusion; no we won't do anything about it; just
ignore us and the damage we are causing."

Well that's too good to pass up. But Slug.org,net,com were all taken so 
I've decided (in the spirit of Monty Python) to start another splinter 
faction: the Stumptown Linux Users Group of Oregon at SLUGO.net. The 
SLUGO group will absolutely refuse to take ourselves too seriously. 
(come on guys, we're supposed to be having fun right?) If anyone has an 
interest in wasting time on a whimsical diversion starting sometime in 
August, let me know (off list is fine).

I actually think there are useful reasons to have more than one Linux 
group in Portland. I have to agree with Dan though, I'm not clear on the 
philosophical distintions between the existing PLUGs. That said, the new 
PdxLug folks do seem to be doing some interesting projects. As I see it, 
that's one of the advantages to having several smaller groups instead of 
one monolithic group - the freedom to take initiative and experiment.

SLUGO?  Piss off.  Bloody Cricketters.  We're forming the OSLUG.net 
group in conjunction with the People's Liberation Front of Judea.  Our 
mission is to advocate Linux, liberate Judea from the Romans, and 
liberate PC users from Microsoft. 

What have the Romans done for us anyway?

Most of this times you cannot X it is due to DNS/IP issues.  X likes to
know which machine is what.

Also some version ssh require keys not passwords, it gets sticky.

The best way to test is run X on the server with the debug flag on a
higher port (2222).  The following will work, but will die after the
first ssh connection goes away.

        sshd -d -p 2222

Then run on the knopix CD.

        ssh -p 2222 -v -X Vancouver-1

Make sure you are not root for the ssh connection.

You may see a X Forwarding being denied message right there or some
other message.

>From there you can play with "xauth, list" and see what is being set up.

I have things like

        mp.zotnet.com:14  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  e7a5263xxxxxxae73dxxxxxxxxb
        mp.zotnet.com/unix:14  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  e7a52633xxxxxxxxae73xxxxxxxb


BTW "xlogo" is a small way to test X settings.


Other places to check:  /etc/ssh/sshd_config (or what ever)

#X11Forwarding no
X11Forwarding yes
#X11DisplayOffset 10
#X11UseLocalhost yes

Thanks! I found it as "System speaker" under the device manager. Actually
by NT I just meant the generic OS family (XP, NT 5.1), not NT 4.

Something to consider when dealing with OMSI:

They had promised to provide a drop for a wireless connection
for KBOO radio in order to facilitate a remote broadcast for
the Waterfront Blues Festival during the July 4th Weekend.

At the last moment, they reneged. Something about the director
of technology saying that it 'was too much work'. All they promised
to do was to provide a network drop (RJ-45) into their backbone.
(During a holiday weekend with load would be light; as well as
a community organization supporting another community organization).

These guys can be a little slipery.

There's a small flaw in your reasoning here, David, if I may attempt to
elucidate.

PLUG (as we know it) is not a formal organization with any inhibiting
structures or hierarchy that prevents a person from going out and doing
whatever they feel needs doing to improve teh community.  It may be that
this mailing list is unpleasant for some people and they want a list that
is more limited in scope or moderated for content or whatever they like
adn they can set up a mail server and do so or even talk to someone with
access to the plug server and set up the list right here alongside this
one.

If your organizations are unstructured and open, there is no meaning to
"forking" or what have you.  I honestly see the PDX LUG split as an ego
problem where people want to make their own name for themselves.  It's ALL
about the name and not at all about the community.

This is simple and obvious, but sometimes unstated assumptions are the
root cause.

In that context, "spoofs" would be a present-tense conjugation of the verb
"spoof".  It's not a pluralization of the singular noun "spoof".

In other words, "to spoof" not "a spoof".

Hm. I suppose technically this is true. If I wanted to do fundraising, 
for example, I could say that I'm a member of the PLUG and start 
soliciting people and organizations. I could decide to store the funds 
in my own name and dedicate them to purchasing beer at spontaneous 
gatherings (ie when I'm thirsty).

On the other hand, some people, like David Mandel, might object on the 
basis that he gets thirsty too, and it's not fair that he's not getting 
any beer.

The fact that the PLUG lacks formal organization, makes it unclear on 
how to get agreement on my idea for a meeting fund. It's easier to set 
up SLUGO and cleanly seperate who's funding my next round. Even better, 
at SLUGO, we've got a clear decision criteria: Majority rule (and I'm 
the only one who can vote).

Heh. Looks like the faux Portland Linux Users Group is more than a little
sensitive on this issue. I've been told to get over my "tizzy" about the
"so-called naming problem" and stop posting to their list. It seems that
dissent isn't welcome on PDXLUG.

I knew the adult-discourse approach was unlikely to succeed, but it was
worth the try...

***"Go On Safari" Tip of the Week Winner--Tony King, Chicago.pm
"I just signed-up for Safari a couple of days ago as they are having a
free 14-day trial offer. I've been reviewing it for my office and it's
a very good reference tool. While I wouldn't want to read a whole book
online, it beats the price of having to purchase those books
individually and having that many technical books at the click of a
mouse can't be beat."

Your group can also participate in this introductory program just for
user group members. To "Go on Safari," any of your members who sign up
for our Safari 14-day free trial can send comments on their
experiences, or tips and tricks for how they used Safari  (it only
needs to be 2 sentences long, but it may be longer) to
safari_talk at oreilly.com.
(Please include your UG name in the email.)

Every week someone will be chosen from the tips or comments submitted
to receive fun stuff from O'Reilly (T-shirts, book bags, or other
surprises). If a member of your user group is selected, your group
receives free gifts, too. Whatever the individual member receives, your
UG will get one, too, to give away at your next meeting, or use however
you see fit. Recipients--and their comments--will be announced in the
User Group Newsletter.

Poked through their archives and even people on the list are confused [1].
It's too bad, looks like there are some good/smart OP (Original PLUGgers) 
over there talking about interesting things.  I just can't past the "Robby 
Russell Show" aspect.  (View the archives by author, don't forget the 
anonymous 'pdxlug at pdxlug.org', who is presumably one and the same).

They took their marbles and went home.  Dropped some along the way too.
Sure is a nice day out...

I don't use attbi or comcast for anything except my internet
connection.  (I use DavidMandel.com, pdxLinux.org, etc for
web sites and mail.  The people (person) owning these domains
haven't ever told me that I will have to change my email address,
unlike most of the "real" ISP routinely do.)

On the other hand, I can't let this go by without complaining about
Comcast.  I just ordered Comcast in a new location.  Their tech
came and sort of installed things.  I mean he left before making
sure anything worked.  He didn't even have a laptop so he could
register the connection for the customer and the registration process
required an MS Windows PC.  I finally dug up a PC running Windows 2000
and tryed to run the install program.  Errors!! Errors!! Errors!!
Well, I did get it to run and got everything working in fairly short
order.  But still, I wasn't totally happy about the experience.
A less experienced user could have had real problems.

I'm sure he has some sentimental attachment from his days at the BLM -
where he ported LTPlus (a GIS app) from SCO Xenix to SCO Unix/ODT. I
wonder if recent events will prompt him to rename the box. :)

So, Dave, how about prime302.DavidMandel.com? No worries about Prime suing

Right.  Nothing that PLUG IS prevents you from doing this.  There are
things, however, that PLUG IS NOT that do.

And other people, particularly the ones who gave you money, might wonder
why you're using a wholly informal organization as a guise for procuring
beer money.

You're talking about a centralized structure for collecting and
disseminating funds in the name of PLUG.  Whenever you start to talk about
informal structure people ALWAYS bring up the idea of fund raising.

The simple fact is that an organization like PLUG has no need for
fundraising.  There are certain things that are done for the sake of PLUG
that cost a little money, but all of those can be managed by the voluntary
and direct contribution of PLUG members to the problem.  The
accountability remains with those who do the work, not some Treasurer,
Minister, President, or Board.  PLUG is not an organization that needs
money.  There are no paychecks to sign and no grand headquarters to
maintain.  Hence, PLUG is not an organization that needs formal structure.

The same is true for the PDXLUG.  That group doesn't need or want a formal
structure (though some felt it was necessary to write a mission
statement... even though there's no process for determining whether a
particular action is within that mission which makes the whole process of
writing such a thing and parading it around nothing more than ego
masturbation).  They can't set up a real fund any more than PLUG can.

I don't see how your statement relates to the argument that nothing PDXLUG
was created to do needed the creation of PDXLUG to do.

Um, so SLUGO is just David.  I don't really do self-assigned nicknames.

The same thing happened to me and I was rather miffed. I'd even set up
a pc running Win2k for him to test the connection with. When I 
tried the installer I got weird errors too, until finally on my second
call to tech support they told me the installation required the Windows 
128-bit encryption pack (?) and I had to get it from a friend, it wasn't
on the CD.

Furthermore the installation program didn't work at all anyway, because the
registration server it pointed to was decommissioned, so I had to just 
manually type in the new server address. If only they'd just given me the
address on a card to begin with I would have done everything under linux 
with mozilla. :P

I don't know anything about the motivations of pdxlug founders.  It's 
just my personal opinion that not everything linux in portland needs to 
be crammed under the PLUG umbrella (so to speak). I think small groups 
can be effective for things that large groups aren't. Of course, that's 
a seperate issue from the choice of a group name that isn't confusing.

I just perused the "discussion" on the list and two things struck me. The
first was that it wasn't a discussion - it was Matt and Robby dictating to
the group what the name would be. They obviously have agendas beyond
spreading the gospel of Linux.

The second was that you really rock Mr. Senior. You were on target,

You got to be kidding! Linux users in Portland a too large group for one

Ahhhhh!  This is very insecure!

X over ssh uses xauth/magic cookies and a fake display (tunneled).

Also since it works from some machines and not others, it is likely
DNS/IP, or a setting on passwords/keys.

Just wondering, Dave, did you try the local system's IP address in your
Display variable?

Some implementations of ssh have x forwarding turned off.  Make sure that 
you are starting ssh with the proper command line options to override this 
behaviour.

Hey, I'm not sayin' it's the right way to do things as a matter of course,
I was just hoping to make some broad strokes to see if it can work at all
and then narrow it down.

I don't want to personalize things too much. As I remember Sean did a lot
of posting when this group was starting. That said, thanks - it was a
interesting read. If your own group can't keep the names straight then
you've got a problem. :):):)

Lets see... about a million people in the portland metro area, 70% of 
them with computer access so 700,000. A conservative estimate is 2-3% 
are using linux, but roll in the unixes like OS 10 and I'd wager it's 
more like 5-10%. So that's between 35,000 - 70,000 users.

Even on the low end, that's a lot of people we're not reaching. If 
people are interested in taking the initiative to start up a group with 
a different focus than the PLUG, I think that's fine - go scratch the itch.

What's strange is to hear the argument that those doing so are 
ego-maniacs AND we want them back in our group. I think the other 
argument I'm hearing makes more sense: they're ego-maniacs AND we want 
them in a seperate group with a very distinct group name.

Mind you, I'm not saying anyone is or isn't an ego-maniac, just that the 
logic of the first argument seems flawed.

Ah - I thought we were talking about those who are geeky enough to meet
and discuss a computer OS. And who think using a particular OS makes a
difference in this world. 

I understand your argument. You're probably right too. I just suggest we
don't try to keep the group free of difficult people and welcome the
creation of a new fraction when it gets a little heavier.

Your statistics are interesting, but inflated. For the majority of
computer users, the box on their desk is just a tool. It's a means by
which they accomplish some sort of real work (even if that real work is
just shootin' rocks in an Asteroids-style game.) Their computer is an
appliance, like a toaster or a vacuum cleaner.

The majority of computer users don't care what operating system they
use; they just want to surf pr0n, read their Email, process words, or
whatever other application they like. This majority of folks is really
not interested in hanging around some bar drinking beer or coffee with
geeks. They're even less interested in talking about their appliances in
some conference room.

There are a lot of interested people who aren't reached by users'
groups. There are a lot more disinterested people who will never want to
be reached by users' groups.

We now return you to the present ranting and raving, already in
progress....

Subject: [PLUG] perl does nothing but segfault
Message-ID: <20030702085031.27a49f36.list@sonofhans.net>

Folks ~

As of about 36 hours ago, perl on my workstation does nothing but
segfault.  Some trivial things work (e.g. $ perl -e "print 'foo'"),
but any script which uses a module fails instantly with "Segmentation
fault."

My system:
  Debian 'testing' (aka 'Sarge')
  Linux kernel 2.4.20
  Perl 5.8.0

After a while debugging two nights ago, in desperation I rebooted -
and it worked!  (I felt the icy touch of Windows on my neck...)  For a
few hours anyway, until it stopped again.

None of the commands, daemons, or cron jobs I run seem to do it --
I've tried all the ones I can think of.  I rebooted again (argh)
yesterday, and it's been fine since then, but it still makes me
nervous.

I don't know enough to debug the problem - even what logs to start
examining.  I don't know how long the system runs before perl dies, or
any idea what precipitates it.  

I was talking about it yesterday and Wil asked what kernel I was
running.  "A rooted one," Ingy replied, before I had a chance to.
Funny, but I hope wrong.  The only thing open to the public is port
22, and I keep the box very up to date.  I ran 'chkrootkit' yesterday
(booted from a CD) and it found nothing.

Wil also wondered if it were corrupted memory or disk corruption where
perl lives.  How can I check for these definitively?

I'm still gathering information, and will post back if anyone's
interested.  Until then, can anyone help?

Thanks in advance,

Randall

heh :)

thanks for the reply, but at this point it's actually working (since a
reboot last night).  if it dies again i'll do as you suggest.

Last word for a while, I swear! :)

Browsing the Indymedia site I came on a meeting announcement from
Robby. The very first response to it was:

"is PDXLUG the same as PDXLINUX.ORG? if not, why are there two separate
portland linux user groups?"

We've seen postings in the pdxlug archive that indicate the pdxlug
membership can't keep the domain names straight. Now we're seeing it in
the general public.  This may not be a technical issue, but it's ONE
PDXLUG NEEDS TO ADDRESS.

Subject: [PLUG] IMAP "public folders"
Message-ID: <E19XnPQ-0002zW-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

This smells to my semi-experienced sinuses like a kludge. So I'm asking if
there's a better way to do this.

Here's what we're trying to do. We're "upgrading" our accounting software to
something that uses Windows. Many (about 30) of our users are going to be
replacing their MacIntoshes with Windows computers.  Their email is currently
Outlook Express and/or Entourage, accessing the (thankfully) Linux mail server
with the POP protocol.  We want to duplicate the contents of the Mac's inbox on
the PC in whatever they're using on the PC (probably, again, outlook).

Not finding any conversion utilities for mac->windows outlook inboxes, we're
looking at a solution that involves: creating an imap "public folder", copying
the mac inbox to the public folder, copying the public folder to the PC inbox.

I can't find anything related to an "imap public folder" in documents for the UW
Imap daemon. Cyrus is ... closer, but I don't want to install cyrus for such a
temporary fix.

Here's what I've found, though;
I can create a file and change the permissions to 666, and then hard link it
into a user's ~/Mail/ directory, and bingo, the Mac version of "mail.app" sees
it as a folder and will move stuff to it and out of it, and said stuff is
visible (and read/writable) by all other people that have links to it. I can see
uses for that, but, frankly, this is what smells like a kludge. There's no
documentation for it, there's no configuration files for it like Samba might have.

What should I be doing here?

He said it worked from other computers, and he is using 'ssh -x' which
should force the client.

You can still override this (perhaps Knoppix is the problem,  Here's a
test.  Run Knoppix on a machine that works and see it it works running
Knoppix!).

Again doing the '-v' at both end would tell you this.

Well, if you want my opinion, I'd install Cyrus and switch everyone over
to IMAP permanently.  This solves the problem of platform and MUA client
portability once and for all, and lets you back up your mail spool
centrally.  There really aren't any downsides and IMAP is a much more
intelligent protocol than POP.  I'm biased, of course, since I sell
Cyrus IMAP-based solutions.

Thanks for the advice.

I'm not absolutely sure what the problem was, but I fixed it.
Actually, I seem to have had a couple problems interacting.
I made a small error in the configuration of my machine in Corvallis
when I installed broad band.  As a result, that machine couldn't
couldn't ssh to itself and use X until I fixed and DNS (or hosts file)
problem.  And then I had another problem, but it went away when I
changed versions of Knoppix.  The truth is I'm not sure what this
problem was, but I don't have it now - even when I use the previous
version of Knoppix.  Maybe it had something to do when the temperature
on Monday, or the time of day, or the number of beers I had at lunch...

Subject: [PLUG] iptables error message
Message-ID: <20030702222157.83211.qmail@web10901.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi 

I set up a RedHat 9.0 with 2 network cards: eth0 and
eth1, it runs o.k., the internal box can browse the
outside world. I guess it means that my iptable works
fine. The problem is that everytime I start the
iptables it will appear the error message: " iptables
v1.2.7a: host/network "start92.168.0.0 not found. Try
iptables -h or -help..."
I am using DSL not the modem. I look all over the
related files to try to find any error about
"92.168.0.0" but couldn't find any. Could anyone help
me with this problem.

Another question is I want to make my samba server to
work, I only familiar with samba and ipchains setting
but not with the iptables setting. Please help!
Thanks

Melinda

I've been following the thread about the problems with X over ssh.  I'm
having a similar problem, but it's with Mozilla and Galeon and gimp on
Red Hat 9 running over SSH or rsh.

They both give me this error:

Other applications don't have problems, like konqueror or
gnome-terminal, and they run fine when I'm in front of the box.

Thanks,

I am a member of both PLUG and PDXLUG and I have NO PROBLEM differentiating
between the two groups. I also resent the generalized insults that PLUGgers
have been posting based upon their LIMITED perspective and PERSONAL
opinions. Based upon the responses from PDXLUG, I don't think that a
name-change will fly. However, it may be possible for us,(PDXLUG), to better
differentiate between our groups which I will suggest to PDXLUG. In the
meantime, I think it would be a better use of everyone's time to stick to
facts and refrain from the name-calling and over-generalizations that make
it more difficult to make any positive changes.

I still haven't heard any kind of reason WHY you should differentiate
yourselves.  The only thing that is confusing is the name.  Otherwise, the
"groups" are identical and have large overlap in membership, the same
goals, and the same (read: no) organizational structure.

So why differentiate yourself?  The only thing that differentiates now is
the name and even that doesn't try very hard to be different.

So why bother differentiating?  What's the difference?

Jeme> So why bother differentiating?  What's the difference?

>From what I've been able to deduce, the people who came to PDXLUG from
PLUG wanted less "noise" on the mailing list.[1] No one really defines
what they mean by noise.  Maybe they think of LUG-like entities as
strictly technical "help" resources, which to me seems too narrow.

The self-declared differentiation at the beginning was that they
wanted the freedom to ban people who they didn't like.  From the
welcome message:

  mailman> Remember we do have the right to refuse service to anyone.[2]

For part of a discussion of that, see:
  <http://www.pdxlug.org/pipermail/pdxlug/2003-January/000077.html>

A lot of the "resistance" to this topic on the PDXLUG mailing list has
been to any discussion of the naming issue or of "governance" type
questions (e.g. what does it mean to be a 'group'?  how are decisions
made?  etc).  I can understand not wanting to help discuss those
problems, but I don't understand not wanting the discussions to take
place at all.  And where else but the group mailing list are you going
to find people interested in contributing to those discussions?


[1] It seems somewhat contradictory that one of the people who
    mentioned this as a reason was Kurt, and yet he is evidently still
    subscribed to the "noisy" PLUG list.  Maybe it's because PDXLUG
    isn't seen as a fully viable replacement yet.

[2] It may just be a figment of my imagination, but I have always
    assumed that you, Jeme, were their (not mine) archetypal example
    of someone to refuse service.

Stop posting this crap to the pdxlug list.
The big difference, is that we don't want to hear this stuff. I can read
plug if I want to know what people think about non-tech stuff.

Its a Technical Mailing List. Please, stop.

Hey Melinda,
You might try looking in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 (or
whatever your internal facing interface is) and make sure that the
NETWORK= entry is correct.

Hi Steve,

Thank you for your quick reply. My eth0 in this case
is    192.168.0. this linux box is among my another
internal network, and the eth1 for this box is
172.16.1.. I check the file ifcfg-eth0 and ifcfg-eth1,
both file setting seem o.k..(ip address and network,
broadcast,)
Is there any other files I should take a look at?

Melinda

How are you starting iptables?  If you cannot start it manually, then your
syntax is probably bad.  In redhat 9.0, why not try doing 

/etc/init.d/iptables status and/or
/etc/init.d/iptables restart.

If that doesn't work, have a look at the file specified in
IPTABLES_CONFIG.

Regards,

Salvador


Since you are using
redhat, the first
place I would look is at the start

There are a few more Melinda. I think the most likely candidate is
probably in /etc/sysconfig/iptables. However, if your using firestarter
to configure and start iptables then this file is likely not going to
contain any information of value (the firestarter init script expects a
different configuration file). If your using /etc/init.d/iptables to
start the firewall then /etc/sysconfig/iptables would be the place to
look. Also, you can look at /etc/init.d/functions for clues since it is
sourced by the /etc/init.d/iptables script.

Yes, I did resolve the problem and my biggest problem seemed to be
that I changed the ip of one machine without making a change to the
DNS (or /etc/hosts file).

I start iptables by typing /etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables
start. My interanl linux boxes can browse internet
without any problems, but the error message (iptables
v1.2.7a: host/network 'start92.168.0.0' not found try
'iptables -h for more information) occured when I
start the iptables by /etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables start
or restart. I search configaration files under
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts,
/etc/firewall/firewall.conf.iptables,
firewall.local.iptables, firewall.dns, firewall,banned
even the files under /etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables etc.,
but couldn't find any '92.168.0.0'.

Let's say you have two instances of the same program that are both
accessing the same remote IP address and service.  When the packets return
to the OS, how are they redirected to the right program instance?

For example, if you had several instances of a script that was sending
different GET/PUT data to a website and returning different results.  How
are the results matched up with the correct calling program?
Thanks,

Each local program gets its own local "port" for the TCP/IP connection.
This port is part of the return address.

You can get a listing of open ports and connections with the netstat
utility.

A tcp socket is defined by source ip, destination ip, source port, and
destination port.

So in your example, when a client connects to the web site, the client
OS hands the client socket a random, high-numbered ( >1024 ) port to use
as the source port.

Each new client will have a different high-numbered source port, and the
server at the other end will send return data for the given client to
that client's high-numbered port.

Looks like a typo somewhere.  Have you tried,

# grep -r start92.168.0.0 /etc

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0307030937300.20680-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  A few weeks ago I upgraded my CUPS installation to 1.1.9. The laser
printer is working just fine, but I've discovered a problem with the color
deskjet just this morning.

  The job goes in the queue and the printer status shows "processing".
However, before anything gets to the printer I see the message, "Printer not
connected. Will try again in 30 seconds."

  The printer _is_ connected -- that's not been changed since the software
upgrade -- and I haven't a clue what might be wrong. And, of course, I'm
trying to print some maps to send to a client today.

  I've tried modifying the printer within the CUPS GUI admin tool, but that
didn't help. I can try deleting the printer and re-installing it. If anyone
has some suggestions about the cause -- and solution -- to this problem I'd
greatly appreciate them.

Thanks,

Rich

  Yes. Several. From within the /usr/sbin/printers dialog box, from mozilla
and from the printer configuration dialog box. Same results. The job appears
to start, shows 0% progress, then the message, "Printer not connected, will
retry in 30 seconds." appears.

  I checked the physical connections and they're as snug as always.

  Deleted the printer definition and re-created it. Tried a test page. Same
results. Sigh.

Tyler,

    Fortunately, my experience was a bit smoother.  I don't like to
admit it, but I had been using the Windows 2000 machine for some
real work a few weeks ago, so it was up to date with 128 bit encryption
and everything installed.  Moreover, the error messages I got weren't
completely fatal.  I was able to get around them or ignore them or
whatever.  Still:
    -  I was given false information by their tech.
    -  I had to install strange legacy equipment to do the installation.
    -  and the installation required more skill on my part than the
       typical customer has.

                                                        Dave

P.S.  On the other hand, it is fast, has decent availability, and is
      almost affordable.

Does the file /etc/sysconfig/iptables exist?

Hi Steve

The way I did to install the iptables is I download
the file called "zeller-firewall", and follow the
steps to set up my iptables files. I start the
iptables by type "/etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables start". 
Actually I check those files you mentioned before I
post my question, but couldn't find any "92.168.0.0".
The internal network seems fine, the 172.16.1.x
machine can browse the internet without any problems,
so I guess the error message just a warning or
something nothing serious.

So I assume that you looked in the start script for the configuration
file?

I'm sorry Melinda, I should have said the name of the configuration
file. I think I'm exhausted.

It should only take a few seconds.  You need to run this as root and don't 
forget to tell grep which directory to look in

# grep -r start92.168.0.0 /etc

If you left out the /etc part, grep will sit there forever waiting for you 
to tell it where to look.

I would almost bet that "start" is coming from the iptables start script
and is not written to the config file. You might stop the grep and redo
it with just the 92.168.0.0

Hi 

Finally, I solved the problem by replacing the
192.168.0.0 with $EXTERNAL_IP in the firewall.iptables
file - the FTP section, since the error occured after
execute the ssh which is FTP part, so I just give it a
try, and that is.

Sorry to confuse you, it's all my fault.
Thank again for your help.

92.168.0.0 is almost certainly being pulled into an initialization script
as a variable.  Based on her earlier posts, I am guessing that it's a
value of the NETWORK she is on.

My hypothesis is that one of her ethernet cards is not a trusted device
and iptables is whining that her firewall is blocking one of the devices,
probably eth1.

More than likely, are you trying to make a web server available to the
public, or just allow clients inside your firewall to view web pages?

Subject: [PLUG] Volunteers for Booth at O'Reilly Open Source Conference
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0307041159440.17330-100000@sco302.DavidMandel.com>

PLUG has a booth at the O'Reilly Open Source Conference on Wednesday
July 9, 2003 and Thursday July 10, 2003.  I was sort of coordinating
things for this, but I have taken a NEW JOB and won't be available.
As a result, Dale Zeutenhorst <dzeut at MicroSharp.com> has been kind
enough to step in at the last minute and take over.  He will need
volunteers to help man (or woman) the booth.

So,

    (1)  If anyone has any ideas on the best (and cheapest) way
         of using this space and want to help contact Dale.

    (2)  Also, I signed up for the booth as the Portland Linux/Unix Group,
         but we would love to have people from the Mid-Willamette
         Valley Linux Users Group and the Eugene Linux Users Group
         and the groups in Astoria and Tillamook and Bend and Medford
         or where ever.   If anyone is coming from where ever bring
         some literature for the table if you have any.  Also, a small
         sign would be nice.  Since we registered as the Portland
         Linux/Unix Group the conference will provide us with a sign
         (I assume), but we are happy to share with other groups.
         This booth is definitely non-commercial, but it is ok
         to make people aware of key group sponsors and group
         consultant lists and things like that.  Just keep it low key.
         Is Free Geek coming to the conference?  If not, we would
         have some of their flyers on the table.  What about
         LinuxFund.org?

    (3)  Finally, we need volunteers to man the booth.
         If you don't have a conference pass at this point, you may
         still be able to get one by volunteering to man the booth,
         but volunteer SOON.  Dale needs to get the name of our
         volunteers to O'Reilly ASAP.  We are really late on this.
         Also, I don't know what type of pass O'Reilly will give
         conference volunteers, but they have hinted that it might
         be a pretty good pass if there aren't too many of them.
         So, it you want to volunteer contact:
                    Dale Zeutenhorst <dzeut at MicroSharp.com>
         with your:
                    Name (first and last):
                    Email address:
                    Phone number:
                    Information Dale can use to schedule you.


                                          Sincerely,

Why does *stuff* always happen on holiday weekends?

Long story, not worth telling* but I find myself in need of a LAN 
port adapter for a Cisco 7200 series router. *Any* twisted pair (10/T 
or 100/T) card will do: PA-4E, PA-8E, PA-FE-TX, or PA2FE-TX. I need 
it before Monday, and am willing to drive anywhere within a 250-mile 
radius of Seattle to get it. I have to be in Portland tomorrow 
(Saturday) hence the subject line.

If anyone has one I can buy, beg, borrow, or... well have in any way, 
please contact me offlist or leave a message at the number below. 
Salescritters welcome, provided they can meet the requirements above.

Thanks in advance.


*The terminally curious can ask for the story, but the telling may 
have to wait until my present situation is resolved.

Subject: [PLUG] ubd2 mount problem in user mode linux
Message-ID: <01C34281.B5B0C0A0.jorgens@coho.net>

I'm gradually learning the stuff I need to make my uml strategy work, and I 
just hit a wall I can't seem to get past on my own.  I'm running the uml 
with the desired ubd0 image just fine, but I can't seem to make any other 
ubd device work right.  First off, the image that rootstrap made did not 
have ubd1, ubd2, etc, though it has ubda0, ..., ubdb0, ... and many others 
I won't need.  Anyway, I made the ubd2 node using mknod /dev/ubd2 b 98 2, 
but mount behaves very strangely.

Whether I try to pass an unmounted partition directly (e.g. /dev/hde6) or 
an image file, I get the same strange behavior when I try to mount it in 
uml using mount -t ext /dev/ubd2 /testmount.  The mount says it was 
successful, but if I ls /testmount, I see a mirror image of the uml root 
directory - not good!  To test and make sure my image file itself was not 
somehow a copy of the uml image, I tried creating a dummy file in the root 
before mounting.  Sure enough, the dummy file shows up in ls /testmount.

Does anyone know what is going on and/or how to fix it?

Thanks,

OK, I found the answer.  I had tried to search the Web before posting the 
question here, but I found it only just after posting.  The minor numbers 
for ubd<n> devices are 0, 16, 32, ..., not 0, 1, 2, ... in case anyone was 
curious.

  I have a message stuch in the mailq since the 1st and I want to delete it.
But, I've forgotten where the outbound mail queue is located. I tried
'rgrep' for the message ID in /var/spool/ but got no hits. I'm running
postfix if that matters.

TIA,

  Found it -- naturally, after sending the original message. It's in

I downloaded S. Punyaratapundhu's Anti-Mosquito program for Windows
2000, and noticed a tarball bundled up with it, it turned out to be a
linux version of the same program! 

I didn't see this advertised on his website anywhere (though I don't 
read Thai), but got the Win2k zip file here:

http://download.thaiware.com/program4/antimosz.zip

Supposedly this program emits sound that mosquitos and other insects 
dislike, so you can use your laptop outside in the summer, although 
it's hard to verify that it's doing anything...

Does anyone have recommendations for VoIP software?  Ideally I'd like it
to be free (or very low cost), able to make computer-to-computer calls and
computer-to-phone calls (not as important to me).  It doesn't have to run
on Linux, but it would be a nice bonus if it did.
Thanks,

I've been using mutt to read email for a while now and I notice
that when I hit 'c' to change mailboxen sometimes it will automatically
have an inbox selected for me.  Most of the time, however, it doesn't.
Does anyone know of a setting that I can put in my .muttrc to make it
have that behavior all the time (if there are new messages in that inbox
anyway)?

Linux:
   kphone (SIP client)

Windows:
   free SIP client: Xten (http://www.xten.com/)

This is actually quite a large topic area.  I'd suggest starting 
backwards, and find the vendor that you want to supply you with 
computer-to-phone service and starting to use the software that works 
with their protocols.  The most common protocols today are H.323 and 
SIP, with SIP being really what is becoming the leading protocol for 
DIY systems.  You should look at iconnecthere.com as a provider; 
reasonable rates, and reasonable policies.

For more information, see:

http://www.pulver.com/products/sip/
http://www.iptel.org/info/products/

I'm considering doing a PLUG presentation on Asterisk, which is an 
Open-Source telephony server that will support VoIP channels as well 
as analog.  However, time is a bit on the scarce side these days...

>From the mutt docs:

  3.11.  Defining mailboxes which receive mail

  Usage: mailboxes [!]filename [ filename ... ]

  This command specifies folders which can receive mail and which will
  be checked for new messages.  By default, the main menu status bar
  displays how many of these folders have new messages.

  When changing folders, pressing space will cycle through folders with
  new mail.

  Pressing TAB in the directory browser will bring up a menu showing the
  files specified by the mailboxes command, and indicate which contain
  new messages.  Mutt will automatically enter this mode when invoked
  from the command line with the -y option.

  Note: new mail is detected by comparing the last modification time to
  the last access time.  Utilities like biff or frm or any other program
  which accesses the mailbox might cause Mutt to never detect new mail
  for that mailbox if they do not properly reset the access time.
  Backup tools are another common reason for updated access times.

  Note: the filenames in the mailboxes command are resolved when the
  command is executed, so if these names contain ``shortcut characters''
  (such as ``='' and ``!''), any variable definition that affect these
  characters (like ``$folder'' and ``$spool'') should be executed before
  the mailboxes command.

I just bought a USB Logitech Optical Mouse for my lap top and
am trying to get my wheel to work.  Here is what I have attempted
to it to work.  I am not having any luck.  The wheel still does not work.

From:   /usr/X11/XFConfig:

I went back, read the web page and got the mapping right.  My
next question has to do with mouse performance.  The movement
on the screen is rather chunky.  The refresh rate seems very low
and it's tough to hit the right spot when trying to click on small icons.
I have upped the resolution seen below to 160.  I can't tell if it helps
or not.  There is a brief period ( about 10 seconds) during the login
process when the mouse works really well, but after the desktop
settles down, the chunkiness returns.  Anyone had this problem and
know the fix?

Thanks

Andy

What window manager do you use? It sounds like that is the
culprit. Try running X w/out a WM (ie: just put xterm in your
.xinitrc or something) and see if the mouse performs correctly.

I am using KDE on a Suse 8.1 install. I changed my .xinitrc and at
the login prompt, I chose failsafe as the window manager (not sure
if that means anything, there was not a choice of "nothing").
After login, I got just the xterm and the same behavior. It
was still chunky.

I am not sure what is causing the problem, but you can use 'xset' command
to, amongst other things, adjust your mouse parameters (acceleration
and threshold) (man xset, look for 'mouse'). I use a Logitech Optical
and it seemed a bit grindy and slow also, but with:

xset m 2/1 4

in my .xinitrc it is now downright, er, zippy.

Here's what I've got.  Never had a problem with mine.  I think the 
important lines are the ZAxisMapping & Buttons.

   Identifier  "Mouse1"
   Driver      "mouse"

   Option      "ZAxisMapping"    "4 5"

Andrew,

    I would be glad to send it out.  I hope no one considers this SPAM.
Of course, most of us do not regard HELP WANTED ads to be SPAM - certainly
not in the current economy.  (People, the following is an announcement
of positions at Amazon.com)  Actually, one PLUG member
took a job at Amazon.com a few years ago after getting his Ph.D. from
the Oregon Graduate Center.  The last I heard he was quite happy there.

Subject: [PLUG] Etherboot.
Message-ID: <200307070355.AA309264544@opusnet.com>

I've figured out how to get Redhat installation images for network images to be
exported via server.  I use mknbi-linux <kernel> <ramdisk> and dump to some file
where I keep my boot images.  Works like a charm.  A few gotchas though, has
anyone rewritten Redhat 9's ftp install to be smart enough to ask for three 
locations to find the RPMS at?  I'm not too keen on having to have the iso 
images and a copy of all the binary rpms on them as well on my ftp site.

Reading Intel's doc it looks like PXE is an extension to dhcp and that it can work 
with any PXE compliant card with a single generic ethernet card driver.  What I don't 
get is what as far as PXE my mobo has on it and if I want to flash a network boot 
program into my onboard ethernet how I go about that.  I don't even know if I can 
use an etherboot disk on this thing.  My mobo is a D845PEBT2.

I use the bootp menu feature with etherboot, a major downfall of this is no 
connection to a central authentication server to prevent just anyone on any 
machine from using a particular network boot image I post.  I generally 
don't want to give public access to a dos boot with fdisk or a Linux installer,
however, having these around is one of the goals of network delivered
booting.  The other gotcha I'm running into is how to come up with a Linux 
system that will boot into and run out of ram entirely for performing 
restoration from my network connected tape server and dump spaces.  Don't 
know if I'll need nfs or if I need to look at rmt closer.  
I wonder if grub can be used as a network bootable OS since it can password 
protect boot selections?  I've heard that only a four meg initrd ram disk is 
possible which evidently can decompress to sixteen megs.  For a modern 2.4.21 
kernel based Linux system I'm wondering how to fit into sixteen megs let alone 
whether or not I can use NFS to deal with the excess.  Maybe I can create a 
very small system around perhaps a 2.2 kernel, open a large ramdisk using that 
system, copy to it off the network, and then pivot root to a newer 2.4 kernel.

I want to run Linux out of ramdisk for backups as a Linux system with recent 
tools can generally mount, dump, and restore any PC filesystem.  One curiosity 
I have is if the MBR from one hard disk is compatible with another insofar as I 
might copy the MBR of a 30 gig drive and want to put it onto a different 
sized/different manufacturer's drive?

BTW: XOSL's mirroring capability is a really nice tool when messing around with
     Windows.  Other than the cd booting feature cut out, I've had really 
     good service with it.

BTW: The ltsp kernel for ltsp 3 has finally been progress patched and it looks 
     really nice :-)

As far as information on Linux from scratch I want to create a 2.4 system that
will run out of at most 32 megs of ramdrive and operate in 32 megs of ram, maybe 
use nfs if required, and provide the backup/restore capabilities I'm after.

[Daniel Petcher] 

If there's an Intel NIC on that motherboard, there are two ways to get
at the Intel Boot Agent: IBAUTIL.EXE is a DOS-based utility that will
edit boot settings on the Flash EEPROM of the NIC to allow you to set
some parameters regarding what protocols it will listen for on POST.

The second way is to hit CTRL-S to interrupt the POST (Power-On Self
Test) at the moment your system is scanning the PCI bus for your NIC.
This action will bring-up a menu-driven interface for configuring the
NIC's Boot Agent.

I don't think I've expressed any opinions in this message, but if I
have, you can be assured that they are not necessarily the opinions of
Intel. I'm just a contractor testing network software drivers there.

  I realize that I asked for CUPS help just before the holiday, and now
you're all at the OSCOM thingie, but I'll ask again for help.

  I upgraded CUPS to 1.1.19 and now the color deskjet is perceived as not

course, I need to.

  Any ideas?

Can you sign up with a service that will adapt the Internet name servers to your 
current ip, a dynamic dns service?  I know the change for static ips when I changed 
over took a couple of days to sync.  I imagine there have to be dynamic services 
that update more quickly.  For one thing, a dial up ISP is usually a dynamic ip 
system where often times an individual modem has a a static ip assigned it but 
you don't always get the same modem.  Doesn't tinydns or Bind 9 have a runtime 
ip to ethernet name mapping mechanism?  Ed Sawicki is the expert on the latter.

Ironically, I have dns and dhcp but I use static assignments because I don't know how
to program a particular hostname to be assigned an ip in a certain range thereafter 
triggering a dns update at assignment time so that other people can look up that 
name at it's affective ip without my needing to maintain a range or ip list.

I don't run but three servers and my workstations/terminals probably don't need the
level of identification they have, but then again I want to allow internal servers.

Try checking register.com and ask them if they can offer you a service that will
track your dynamic ip address.  Static ip at opus costs a one time $50 to get 
bridged which turns the router into a transparent pass through and then an 
additional $5/month or so for each static ip.

One trick you could try is to use your old PC to get the comcast to work and then
hook your Mac up to it to share the connection.  One thing to look at is if you can
get a true router box as opposed to an internal card where often these only work
under Windows because of the collusion that Microsoft and sadly Intel also are so
famous for.  In all fairness IBM, Compaq, HP, etc. have occasionally committed the
crime of collusion and rigging also.

I don't need cable but it is all that I can get and my parents like it, so I 
don't have much choice right now.. So for now, I need help getting my IP to be 
static with Comcast until DSL avalible.

I think that there are ways to do it like that (dydns.com/org? has a setup with 
my Linksys router..)

You bring up something interesting to me tho, about inner networks. I am 
guessing your servers in the inner network each have a seperate domain/sub-
domain, such as computer.domain.com right? How does one set something like that 
up, while still using a router? I had it working before I started using a 
router, but I don't know how to do with with a router..

Humm.. I think that perhaps NoIP is not as good as something such as DyDNS 
because they cost the same ($25/yr) and the latter one is intergrated with my 
Linksys router. They also seem to have the same features.

My experience with attbi was that the dynamic ip did not
change. I had the same ip for a year; it even followed
when I moved a short distance. 

I expect comcast to be the same. The ip should only change if
- comcast changes something backstage (rare/unlikely)
- you allow the dhcp lease to expire
- you connect with a different machine (MAC address)

My setup has a linksys router directly after the cable modem.
Since I only request dhcp with it, and it renews the lease
automatically, my ip address doesn't change.



Does your ip really change every 3 days, or are you just
concerned it might?

Well, it has been changing every 3.5-7 days for the last two months (Since I 
got my router). It never did it when I have my Linux box running on it as the 
DHCP client, but it does now. I think I am going to go with DynDNS or TZO..

This has been my experience as well. I use zoneedit.com to maintain my
DNS records, and I've had to update my IP address very few (3, perhaps
4) times in the last three years.

If you're concerned about it, try running ntpd or something on one of
your machines. That'll generate enough network traffic to convice the
comcast network that your interface is in use. (Of course, you ought
to be running ntpd anyway. :-)

I had the same IP with @home from the time I signed up until the time
they went out of buisness.

I had the same IP with ATTbi from the time they bought @home, through
the Comcast merger, up until just over a week ago, where it has changed
once every 3 days since.

Sadly, each of the leases is good for 7 days. I can't see how this could
be helping anything. Their tables have to be very polluted at this
point; that or they keep getting flushed by mistake (intentionally??).

Fortunately, no-ip.com has been totally reliable throughout - even with
the client running on my 2k box instead of my linux box. :)

What does ntpd do? I would go install it now, but my IP changed and I am not at 
home right now. My IP has been having LOTS of traffic, but still changes. Lots 
as in a few GB per day, and constantly. I am going to go with DynDNS.org.

NoIP is free, otherwise I'd be using DynDNS right now.

NoIP only costs money if you need some of the extra features. I don't
know what your requirements are, but I've found that I don't. A simple
DNS entry (not a forwarder) was all that I needed, and they have
provided it for free without fail for several years now.

Just so you know, Comcast.net prohibits the running of servers on its network.  If you say this is your parent's service, perhaps you should consult with them first before you risk having their service cut off.  

>From it's acceptable use policy under the section of prohibited activity:

(xiv) run programs, equipment, or servers from the Premises that provide network content or any other services to anyone outside of your Premises LAN (Local Area Network), also commonly referred to as public services or servers.

I already have that with MyDomain.com. I signed up before they started
charging, so I still have a free account. If I signup w/ NoIP, I will have
to pay the same as with DynDNS because I need a Domain to be forwarded, not
just a sub-domain..

They know about it. It is mainly just an internal network server, but it has
SSH to the outside for the reasons of controling the server. This is another
reason I want DSL, because they allow full servers and have better UL
speeds, unlike Comcast.

Gadzooks!  Why would ANYONE willfully endure a commercial organization's
such blatant contempt for their customers?  And why would anyone willfully
contribute to this heinous and egregious subversion of the entire design
of the internet?

The answer, I guess, is pretty much always, "Because they have no choice".
Well, so much for the free market.

Consolidate, consolidate, consolidate.

I've always interpreted the @home/att/comcast no-servers policy to
mean that I can't offer it to any person who doesn't ordinarily (and

Are there any image utilities that would allow me to open an image and
zoom in at a particular location, for example, horizontal pixel 200 and
vertical pixel 150?
Being able to send the X-Y coordinates to the image app using a script
would be ideal.

Agreed. We cannot get any other broadband, so I am stuck sitting on this
cable line that cannot be used to it's potential..

Does anyone know if Comcast has yet put transfer caps on networks? I'm sure
that will come sometime.. :(

There has been some class action against cable providers because of abuse
of customers who don't have an alternative.  Many people in West Linn who
want more than dial up are not only forced to buy cable, they are also 
forced to buy cable TV.  There was some deal that said third parties must
be allowed to offer their telecommunication services on the lines of the big
boys for free but that seems to have failed.  It surprises me that the 
telecommunications lobby is as strong as it is with the number of customers 
that are becoming angered over abusive practices and poor services.

Long term it looks like laws similar to the anti collusion ones are going to
be needed to prevent a few broadband providers from essentially dominating all
Internet use and setting all the rules.  

For that matter, when are the anti collusion laws going to be enforced?  I'd 
like to see mandatory labeling for any hardware product that is unless 
otherwise indicated assumeably generic.  Where products are not generic 
the information to use them with a wide variety of software platforms is 
withheld.  A prime example is the soundmaker Cadenza integrated into the 
D845PEBT2.  It's not just classes of hardware that are not Linux or 
other environment friendly, Gateway, Dell, ... have a horrendous history 
of modifying, rigging, hardware to fail in software environments 
other than their target .  Part of the problem with this hardware rigging
is that it is a nuisance even for users of the target operating system.  
It disgusts me that a driver should have to have a patch applied to it 
from the same OEM cd.  Is any PC compatible producer resisting collusion,
rigging, and design obscurity?  I've about had it with Intel.  It's ridiculous
to not be able to get a Microsoft sound card to work under Windows, and yes
I did check that 98SE is a supported choice.

The courts have said that noone can replace the PC, but how hard would it be?
Maybe the time has come for a new platform to be produced that is from the 
onset based on an open, gpl'ed, hardware design.  With gpl hardware debugging
Linux, at least the port to that platform, gets a whole lot easier.

On my system, it didn't have any affect. If I move the mouse across

four times, and I'll have to wait 1-2 seconds for control to catch up.

Anybody have any ideas?

Yes, do `xset m 5'.  My mouse is plenty zippy with this setting.  If it is
too fast for you try toning it down to a 4 or 3.5 or so.

Why does that surprise you?  The strength of the lobby has nothing to do
with the happiness of the customers (or even, really, their complacency),
but with the deep pockets of their campaign funds and the high paying jobs
they can offer the family members of the legislators and regulators.

What's the need of laws that don't get enforced -- indeed, have no
mechanism for enforcement?

You can't put a corporation in jail or sentence it to death.  These legal
fictions have all the rights of individuals and can face almost none of
the dissuasive criminal punishments.  What do you do when a non-person
(with all the rights of a person except the right to vote -- at least with
a legal ballot) is convicted of breaking the people's law?  Fine it.
That's all.  This has a two-fold destructive effect:  First, it makes the
government dependent on crime for revenue and second, it means that you
can feel free to break the law as long as you have the money to cover it.

> For that matter, when are the anti collusion laws going to be enforced?

As soon as the public agencies remember they are agents of the public.

Most USB cameras are emulated SCSI devices. Try dmesg to see what device
it's using but normally it's the first unused SCSI device. In my case it
assigns /dev/sdb1 since /dev/sda is used by my 2940U2W.

Heh, you sound as if this AUP is news. :)

It's the same AUP that AT&T and @Home had.

No servers, none of the time.

I've even heard of people that got their service shut off because they 
played a network game over their cable connection...

This is the script I use. It uses jhead to get the date/time of the 
photo and rename it:

#!/bin/bash
# A script to copy photographs from a Fuji finepix camera mounted
# as a vfat volume via USB and linux SCSI emulation /dev/sda1
# with the user option.

MOUNT_POINT=/local/camera

# Get the single command line parameter which should a non-existent 
directory
new_dir=$1

if [ -z $new_dir ]
then
        echo "Usage: $0 new_directory_name";
        exit -1;
fi

# Prevent overwriting of existing directories
if [ -f $new_dir -o -d $new_dir ]
then
        printf "That directory exists already - please rename it or 
choose a new name for this one\n";
        exit -1 ;
fi

mounted=`grep ${MOUNT_POINT} /etc/mtab | wc -c`
if [ $mounted -gt 0 ]
then
        umount ${MOUNT_POINT};
fi
mount ${MOUNT_POINT}
printf "Starting the copying now\n";
time cp -pr ${MOUNT_POINT}/dcim/100_fuji $new_dir
copy_count=`ls $new_dir | wc -l`;
printf "Copied $copy_count files to $new_dir\n";

printf "Renaming files\n";

jhead -ft -nf -c $new_dir/*.jpg;

# Clear up after the copying
umount ${MOUNT_POINT}

This is not a speed problem. This is more of a drawing problem.
For example if I try to execute a menu item, I will drag the arrow
down to the item I want and click the mouse button, then a half
second later, the arrow catches up and moves down to the next
item and then the mouse click occurs and I end up choosing the
wrong item.

So, the arrow is getting drawn every half second (a slight exageration
I am sure), instead of twenty time per second.

Is there anyway to adjust how often the mouse is refreshed?

Thanks

Andy

We hosted a LAN game on our outer server for a few days during a LAN party.
The people who monitor don't really care, I think. We also have 3Mbps
download vs the 1.5Mbps sold to us, with the default modem and no

This may work for you:

    display -crop 48x64+176+118 -geometry 400% image.jpg

This will take a 48x64 pixel (width x height) block starting at top-left
coordinate 176,118 (i.e. centered on 200,150), zoom the image by 4x, and then
display it.

The "display" program is part of the ImageMagick package:

Good luck,

For VPN access to the office where we have a Netgear FVS318 firewall/NAT 
appliance and I've been using DynDNS.org's free service so I can use 
FQDNs as the remote end point on the VPN tunnel setup in the office. 
There are a number of DynDNS.org clients out there that support 
multiple DynDNS-type services and a variety of operating systems are 
also supported. 

I'm using "ddclient" on my OpenBSD firewall which is a Perl script. It 
gets invoked automatically by "dhclient" if my assigned IP address 
changes. I've also noticed that "ddclient" updates my DynDNS.org 
profile if it hasn't been updated for more than 15 days so I don't lose 
the domain name. DynDNS.org appears to revoke ownership of names that 
haven't been updated for a certain period of time.

I've never seen any port probes hitting my firewall from my ISP since I 
lost I lost my @Home service back in 2001. @Home used to look for open 
news servers and were regularly probing port 119 on all of the systems 
on their network. 

Since my service went to ATTBI and now Comcast I've never seen them 
doing any port probing looking for any open services. Perhaps they have 
script kiddies in their employment since I get several 100 port probes 
a day from different locations. ;)

About the only services I run on my firewall are "ssh", "sendmail" and 
"ntpd" and I block all inbound connections to my firewall from the 
cable modem side. I run "ntpd" so all of my internal systems have a 
stratum 2 time server to sync with. I still use "tin" for reading 
usenet and it seems to want to use "mail" to send email and so I rolled 
my own "m4" file for a sendmail configuration and got sendmail working 
with my ISP's mail servers. 

I'm not running my own email server since I still get all of my inbound 
email via POP3 from Comcast's POP server and as I mentioned before all 
inbound connections are blocked on my firewall so no one can connect to 
any running service from the outside.

It's not new, but it's still outrageous.  I am still outraged and you all
should be, too.  They're trying to turn a network of peers into a deeply
divided network of castes -- particularly of "content providers" and
passive viewers.

The technology is removing the formerly obvious hierarchical
stratification of network connections, but business is working hard
against technology and hard against progress.

And it sickens me and I don't understand how anyone could accept such a
thing without shouting about it every day.  That was my whole point.

Just because it's been going on for a long time doesn't mean it's OK.

Message-ID: <200307080249.AA549388596@opusnet.com>

I'm using the Linux From Scratch guide put out October 2002.  Why is it so important not
to compile utilities with dynamic binding before chrooting into the LFS system?
I am wondering how to adapt this system as my real goal is to make this work over
nfs and boot off of network.  Maybe I only have to modify my approach to the init
scripts?

One curiosity I'm running into is with configure.  Does it detect what platform your
on affecting the compilation result?  I ask as I'm compiling on a Pentium III but want
this LFS system to work on a true 386 also.  I look at the gcc spec file on my host 
system, valhalla, don't see any optimizations though.  I guess another good question
is if there is a way to compile for multiple architectures and arrange to have the
system use the best library for the system it's running on?  Well, architecture is
probably the wrong term for 386 verses Pentium 4 or AMD K6 where I tend to think a 
different architecture would be an alpha or a PPC.  The IA32 architecture should be
contained in everything from an AMD K6 to a Pentium 4 to an IDT Winchip I would 
think, unless that's just the Intel implementation of x86.

Anyone know why optimizations crash the compilation of binutils?  Well that's what the
guide said would happen anyways though my compile didn't crash so I guess I'm not 
optimized then.

My LFS system is being built in an extra partition on my host box.  I'm wondering if
the host box should have this system in it's fstab and integrity check the partition
for it at boot?  Will my network clients fsck my LFS system?

Anyone know why diffutils, a special utility for decrypting function labels produced
from C++ code where overloading of functions is possible, and other various tools are
needed in a base Linux system?  Bash I can see, but why do I need gawk?  

Anyone have an example of using strings from the binutils package?

This static system I'm producing, I suppose if it works on a 386 on up that I can tar
it up and use it later to build a dynamically linked Linux system from scratch where 
a host distribution is on the box already and the custom system goes on another 
partition.  Do I need seperate swap partitions for these two systems?  Any tips when
I get to the nfs export part?   

GCC-3.2 seems to have some fascinating bugs.  What's this copying problem compiling gcc
with a local gcc-2.2.3 compiler when a static structure is passed all about?  Why not distribute patched code instead of providing a patch?  Valhalla has gcc-2.2.5 so I guess
I don't have to worry about this bug.

First hint is to use the verbose flag, ipchains -nvL.  If you can get the rule number
you can delete that specific rule.  Another option if you have scripted the firewall that
you want is to shutdown your network interfaces temporarily, flush all rulesets, set your
default input, output, and forward rules to ACCEPT, and then apply your firewall.  In the
days when I used portsentry I would have problems with being unable to get rid of reject
rules and I also think that it was programmed to reject anyone who would probe the wrong
port.  Unfortunately as much as this is a crackers way to find a weakness it is also a
valid hack in some cases in determining what services are available and I ran into 
blocking people I didn't want to block.  Linux has powerful networking code where many
of the tools are just wrappers with limited functionality.  Another possibility is to
reprogram your syslogd by changing /etc/syslog.conf.  What log level does ipchains use
anyways?  I use to have a syslog rule that logged packet messages to a seperate file
from the rest of the logs and even managed to program firewall rules to allow a friend
to do udp tunneling not knowing the ports that needed to be opened ahead of time.

Because they are linked against your current
libraries, when you chroot, the libraries don't exist
any more and all your binaries become broken. You will
eventually rebuild everything again dynamicly, only
linked against the right copies of the libraries.

I thought diffutils was used for comparing files and
creating and applying patches. I've never heard of it
having anything to do with C++ function overloading.

It may not be Linux, but I can use the strings program
to get some information about my kernel in FreeBSD.

No. A single swap partition will work.

[Michael, can you adjust your linewrap so that it either does not wrap
lines or wraps them at <80 columns.  Those long lines make reading a pain
and I think some are as likely to skip the message as try to decipher it.]

As Vincent Damewood pointed out, this is because you'd be linking against
libraries or versions of libraries that just won't exist in your chrooted
system.

I know the LFS book says that you should rebuild everything dynamic and
that's a good idea, but I also like to keep copies of the static binaries
in /sbin just in case /lib is damaged or inaccessible at some point.

You'll also have to build with the most generic options for your processor
family in order to maintain binary compatibility.

Yes.

Right.  There are environment variables that can control the options make
passes to gcc.  The cross-compiling hint will help.

I've never built LFS with a filesystem that requires fsck.

diffutils is the GNU diff and patch programs for noting the difference
between files and generating and applying patches.  It's absolutely vital
when compiling software from multiple sources.

<URL: http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/diffutils.html >

> Bash I can see, but why do I need gawk?

gawk is the GNU implementation of awk.  It's used in shell scripts
throughout a system.  You'll also find that the LFS book will include
short scripts for patching or modifying a particular configure script or
Makefile and those scripts may well need awk.

And, quite frankly, a unix system without awk just isn't a unix system.

> Anyone have an example of using strings from the binutils package?

I've used strings to look for undocumented command options and all kinds
of odd things.  It can be used to identify some trojans, too.

> Why not distribute patched code instead of providing a patch?

One of the main points, for me, of build a system from scratch is knowing
exactly how it differs from the generic source as created by the package
maintainers.  I download the source from the maintianer's site and check
it against any available signature keys and then apply patches myself.

People used to ask me WHY I went to these pains to keep track of the
software on my computer.  I don't know that I have an answer that I can
put together in english and make any real sense.  But the answer would be
very similar to the answer to why I ride a fixed gear bike.  Perhaps I
just like to be in as direct control of my machines as possible.

My guess is that your video card or the X server driver for it doesn't
support hardware cursor, which makes it fall back to software cursor,
which can be pretty slow.  Please send us the output in the X.log file
after running the command:

X -probeonly >~/X.log 2>&1

Use:

iptables --line-numbers -vl

to get the line number of the rule, then:

iptables -D <WHATEVER_CHAIN> <LINE_NUMBER>

See the man page for iptables for an explanation.

I've seen this once, but not on RH9. If one of the packages it wants to
update is apt or rpm, try updating these packages manually.
If it does not help, you can remove all files under /var/state/apt and
/var/cache/apt (but not directories!) and have it start from scratch.

Posting a Red Hat question to a Debian isn't necessarily rude, but as
I'm sure you'll find from the flames you get, kinda stupid :)

Have you done an 'rpm --rebuilddb' recently?  Are there any obvious lock
files in /var/lib/rpm?  You might find you'll need to manually dump and
rebuild the RPM database using the steps described by Jeff Johnson here:
http://www.rpm.org/hintskinks/repairdb/

I've got an issue right now with my own RPM database, but haven't
actually tried to rebuild it.

My experience with attbi was that the dynamic ip did not
change. I had the same ip for a year; it even followed
when I moved a short distance. 

I expect comcast to be the same. The ip should only change if
- comcast changes something backstage (rare/unlikely)
- you allow the dhcp lease to expire
- you connect with a different machine (MAC address)

My setup has a linksys router directly after the cable modem.
Since I only request dhcp with it, and it renews the lease
automatically, my ip address doesn't change.



Does your ip really change every 3 days, or are you just
concerned it might? 


Jon

I am still hoping to get a few more people to donate some time to the
booth. Also needed are a few more chairs and a table (my card table is
showing its years.)

What I would like to do is make our booth have information about Linux
in our community. 

If you are going to be at OSCON, we will have chairs so stop by and rest
your feet as you go by.

Dirk,

Since none of the experts answer, you'll have to make do with mine for
now: 

I use an USB reader to upload from a flash card. RedHat assigns it to
/dev/sda1. I added this to /etc/fstab:

/dev/sda1 /mnt/usb vfat user,uid=500,noauto  0  0

(500 is me). Then I created an empty directory /mnt/usb and allowed
write access to my account. Now I use a script to suck up the pictures:

if [ $# -ne 1 -a $# -ne 2 ];
then
  echo 1>&2 "Usage: copyusb destinationpath"
  echo 1>&2 "   destinationpath: This path will be created if it does
not exist."
  exit 1
fi

if [ ! -d $1 ]; then
    mkdir $1
fi
if [ -d $1/usb ]; then
    rm -rf $1/usb
fi
mount /mnt/usb
cp -vr /mnt/usb $1/
chmod -R a+rw $1/usb
umount /mnt/usb
echo "Done!"
# End of script

I understand your point. For some, there is no alternative besides 
dial-up. I specifically live where I do because I know that DSL is 
available. I lost my broadband for a year when I moved to Hillsboro. 
After my lease was up, I moved back to Aloha.

I'll second that, Long term the options are to try and bring DSL where there
is cable and dissatisfied customers or perhaps WiFi when DSL isn't a viable
option.  The other possibility is satellite, unforunately, the Starband 360 
which seems to be the major two way choice is Windows only and I for one am 
bothered by it's poor refresh characteristics during browsing.  Cable users 
sadly probably are better off than their satellite counterparts, and to 
think that cable gets blasted so often yet no providers are smart enough 
to actually offer a better deal in order to compete.  In some ways what do 
you lobby for and who do you lobby to cause efforts to be made in the public 
good on this issue.  I for one would love being able to have Linux on a high 
speed satellite connection with good range without paying too much or dragging
Redmond in.  I'll bet you can argue that satellite and cable are often rigged
technologies, but how do you go about that intelligently and what is success
in today's environment?

"[Michael, can you adjust your linewrap so that it 
 either does not wrap lines or wraps them at <80 columns.  
 Those long lines make reading a pain and I think some 
 are as likely to skip the message as try to decipher it."

 Sorry, this ISP webmail program probably does html too.
 I need to get qmail back up but I haven't gotten around
 to it and in all honestly my mail server documentation
 is really for sendmail.  One curiosity is if the current
 sendmail still has the security problems that merit 
 struggling with some other MTA?  In some ways sendmail
 with Maildir boxes may be a better choice than qmail
 simply because I have a better chance of configuring
 sendmail properly since my brother left me a 3000 page
 book on version 8.

 I'm using opusnet.com, I don't know if this webmail
 program allows me to adjust linewrap and turn off
 html.  Don't think so.  I remember when I last set
 up sendmail that I had it use sendmail restricted
 shell but the qmail docs say that sendmail use of
 /var/mail is a moajor security problem where I
 wonder if sendmail can be adapted in a manner similar
 to what you do with qmail and it's maildirs?

 Qmail is easy to get started in but I have yet to get
 it configured to allow anyone to send me email with
 the nececssary filtering while not allowing just
 anyone to use my mail server to send mail potentially
 upsetting all the anti open relay sites.  For one
 thing my curiosity about procmail, what you use with
 sendmail, has been piqued for quite some time.  
 Gerhard Mourani's book, Securing and Optimizing Redhat
 Linux The Ultimate Solution, also blasts qmail for all 
 the extra stuff, daemontools etc., that it needs and
 claims that the mailing lists don't answer a lot of
 good qmail questions.  I for one haven't done very well
 with the Life with Qmail site.  Qmail may be a better
 choice when it comes to serious mail needs if your
 going to read the source and actually be able to 
 understand it, an option that can be quite time 
 consuming and a massive challenge to focus.

Hm, that didn't have much info; perhaps you could send
/var/log/XFree86.0.log instead?  I seem to recall something about the
mice on Vaios--possibly a shared interrupt with the USB controller.

Subject: [PLUG] Adventures in ISC dhcp 2...
Message-ID: <200307081740.AA250020114@opusnet.com>

What group does the group section refer to?

If I could say group and then the mnemonic label
of a shared-network I'd defined before I'd know,
but it doesn't seem to work that way.

Do you put the group section in the shared
network section you want it to be associated
with?

I ask as I'm implementing dhcp2 backup
server on a gateway and there are two 
different shared networks on that box.

As far as failover, I'm guessing that I 
need to define the same static mappings 
and then have two different dynamic 
ranges on my two dhcp servers.



BTW: I have a working DNS that replace
     the staticly mapped hostnames with
     their ip addresses.  It might be
     nice to replace this scheme with
     dynamic dns and a range for each
     subnetwork I define.  I don't subnet
     having an open class C mask but I do
     put computers in the same room within
     blocks of 15 ip's a piece.  In a
     sense I arbitrarily subnet.

     My DNS is a series of A records, I
     don't how I'd map MAC addresses to
     a range of ips + hostname and  
     have the DNS dynamicly update the
     hostname to ip mappings so that I
     don't need to keep a list of 
     numbers. I want to avoid losing the 
     ability to access a workstation or 
     terminal by hostname instead of ip.

     Essentially I have this:

     192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.15   # server room
     192.168.1.16 to 192.168.1.31  # network 1
     192.168.1.32 to 192.168.1.47  # network 2
     192.168.1.48 to 192.168.1.63  # network 3
       ...  up to network 6 ...
     192.168.1.112 to 192.168.1.127 # Dynamic Range 1
     192.168.1.128 to 192.168.1.143 # Dynamic Range 2
       ...  my Jetdirect 170X box is at...
     192.168.1.254
       ...  And I guess that ...
     192.168.1.255
 
     is the broadcast for all nets I defined.



I don't know how I'd do failover to a second
server for the network booting part of the
following template.  For starters I want
workstations to be able to get their mappings
in a failure from a second dhcp server where 
the static mappings for booting up as a 
terminal are the same as the mappings that
are needed if you are going to load up as a
workstation.  I'm guessing the second dhcp 
server needs a different dynamic ip range 
than Dynamic Range 1.

Just so everyone knows, in the event my
primary dhcp is down it probably means
that both my mailhub and X server are 
down also.  My master lan dns used to
be on my mail server but I've moved it
out to one of my two gateways so that
my master/slave inside and out servers
are on my gateways.  Out refers to the
name servers for robinson-west.com 
serving Internet clients.

I'm using LTSP and for one don't want NFS and
X-Windows on a gateway box.  Do I need to
put the backup dhcp server on a non gateway
box?  I want to avoid the latter as it means
another server since I only have one behind my 
two Internet gateways.  My X server will
eventually by my master mail hub where this
is the only machine that will allow accessing
the spool anyways.  Slave mail servers are
evidently not supposed to allow such access
to the mail spool merely existing to feed
mail to the master hub when it comes back.
I exclusively use terminal booting for mail
access when I have my own site up and 
eventually I want to use my Linux From Scratch
system as a netbooted Linuce for backing
up workstations similar to the way one would
use Norton Ghost. 

Should I transition to dhcp 3 for failover
and how would I get there from my 
template?

Without a backup dhcp server for workstations,
my slave Bind 8.4 name server serving my lan
is pointless since I'm still facing single
point of failure.

NOTE: The template has some questions in it...

i.e., Say this is a template for dhcp server 1 "..."

"
# Is this needed for clients I don't statically define

                  .
   option option-197 "Redhat 9 install:::RH9-install";



   # The hosts that are fixed follow.

   host aaa
   {

        hardware ethernet "replace with aaa's MAC address";
        fixed-address aaa.ayyy.bzzz;
        option option-188 "Welcome aaa";
   }

       .
       .
       .

   host zzz
   {

        hardware ethernet "replace with zzz's MAC address";
        fixed-address zzz.ayyy.bzzz;
        option option-188 "Welcome zzz";
   }
}
"

For the second server I guess the only change would be that
the shared-network foo section should have a different range.

Sorry about the length here :-)

Greetings...

OK... I wish to thank all of you who extended me a gracious hand in
getting the modem up and running.

I finally got it up and running, and now that I know how.. it's fairly
simple!! 

Simply go to this website http://www.linuxant.com/drivers/ (I have a
Zoom 3025C).. select the driver for the Distro and Kernel you're using.
Download it... install it... and away you go...

Once again... thanks for your outstanding understanding support!!!

I hate to be the one to rain on everyone's parade but the only reason
that cable companies are as draconian as they are is because government
regulations allow them too.  Data services provided by cable companies
fall under different rules than data services provided by telephone
companies.

The moment that the FCC get's it's mind changed by telco's that they are
competing at an unfair advantage with cable companies for data services
it's all over.  The AUP from your DSL provider will read the same as for
a cable company.

But there's trade-offs. The regulations concerning wait times for cable
companies call centers are much more stringent that telephone companies.

All,

I will be giving out prizes from O'Reilly. 

I'm asking around to see if anyone would like to donate some floorspace

  I agree with the sentiment, but you should keep in mind is that these
rules usually aren't targeted at the intelligent, skilled, and respectful
users.  They're primarily directed at the idiots and losers.  Like a 16 year
old hosting a porn or gaming site for a hundred thousand of his or her
closest friends, or some ninny trying to start up a commercial site on their
cable modem.  The Internet is "magic" to 99% of the population.  They don't
know or care how much traffic their actions create.  

  The nasty be true fact is that the infrastructure behind a cable modem or
DSL is not a limitless quantity.  Bandwidth is a limited, shared, resource.
It costs money.  There has to be some method for protecting the majority of
the users from the actions of the few.

  I agree that Comcast's, formerly ATTBi's, restriction are extreme.  Even
with the restrictions, I occasionally enable incoming HTTP or SSH on my
cable modem connection.  I keep my activities at a low level.  I've never
been threatened or had my service interrupted.  

  I'm also working on a new End User Agreement for a wireless ISP project.
One of my goals is to allow the customer to run servers, but put in enough
restrictions to protect the bandwidth from rouge users.  It also need to be
understandable to the non-technical and pass legal review... its not an easy
task.  The *easy* way out is to simply say *no servers* for normal users.
Servers would only be allowed, at a higher rate and a bandwidth cap, for
business users.  My partners and I are still looking at the issue...

You also need to keep in mind that this service is marketed as for
entertainment use in the home. Sadly, the rules are required to protect
the masses. It is no different than a lifeguard at a pool. If you're by
yourself, horseplay is your business. If you're in a crowd, it's
everybody's business. If you want to run servers and have a static IP,
I'm sure they have a product (a bigger pool) to accommodate that, at an
appropriate price. @Home had a corresponding @Work service. I suspect
Comcast has something similar.

I have been very happy with the service I get considering the price I
pay. I run servers for personal use only, which I believe is in the
spirit of their rules. Since my bandwidth usage is in-line with a home
entertainment system, they've never asked me to shut them down.

Regards,
Paul

Subject: [PLUG] Secure network booting...
Message-ID: <200307091256.AA656015658@opusnet.com>

It's easy enough to set up a bootp menu and dos or Linux install
images.  Trouble is, what options do I have to bring authentication
into the picture before anyone is allowed to network boot?  Now for
memtest and X terminal booting there isn't a problem so I don't need
to worry about those options.  This Linux system I'm building from
scratch for intended use as a restore system will offer root
access to the local drives of a client's machine facilitating
dumping to network or restoration from it.  The latter system should
not be bootable or usable without a client authenticating where it's
preferable to authenticate against my samba domain controller.  I 
probably need wrapper scripts to take care of root access to the
tape drive.  I may want to have rmt, I'm looking at just using tar.
Right now my DI30 drive is on my 386 as I can't seem to get it to
work without the 2.2.14 kernel and an apparently proprietary 
patched ide tape driver.  Otherwise I'd have the tape drive on the
same machine I have my dump drive on.  To some degree I'm debating
whether or not NFS is a better choice on the tape server than samba
because of the large files involved.

Hi:

I was at OSCON downtown and got a copy of KNOPPIX Linux-On-CD.
Incidentally, my Linux box at work died on me a few days ago due to, I 
think,
a bad harddrive.

I just booted KNOPPIX and it is running great.  I am very tempted
to mount my harddrive and see if I can salvage some data.
I did not remember what filesystem it was using, I tried both ext2 and ext3,
but both options complain that it is the wrong filesystem.

Is there any other trick I can try?  Thanks for any tip/pointer.

  In order:

  Check your boot logs for errors. See if the drive was identified during
boot.

  cat /proc/ide/hda/model

  You should see the drive model number.  This will tell you if the drive is
on the IDE bus and the controller is responding to IDE commands.

  fdisk /dev/hda, and then "p" to print the partition table, type "q" to
exit

  It will show you that the disk is active and the partition table is
intact.  

  fsck -N /dev/hda  

  fsck should show what kind of file systems it finds on the disk.

I have 500 sq. ft. of finished basement that you could use.  Ample
power, Verizon DSL and Comcast Broadband hooked up to a switch and
802.11b AP.  As it is a basement, the temp is comfortable too.

Contact me offline if interested.

My bandwidth is high, with out servers..In the last month, my personal
computer has done 49GB down, and 14GB up. Given, a little bit of that is
inside the network, but most is outside. This month, I think it will be a
lot lower as I have stoped using p2p (The 14GB up is NOT from p2p - I never
shared), but still I use a lot of traffic between my computers and my
friends...

I am looking into a higher-speed (higher-pay..) Comcast package that will
allow servers, because I would like to be allowed to do what I do now but do
more of it (instead of hosting a small site with nothing useful on it,
hosting a useful server with games or something), and then I could make one
of my test servers a production server :)

Yes, right after I sent the log, I looked at the file myself and
commented out the second mouse and there is no change.

If you don't put optimizations into the spec file for gcc will configure
in general detect what your compiling on and optimize for that?

How can I override this so that say a Linux System I am building from scratch
on a PIII work on a 386 on up?  At the very least I want my system to work on
Athlon's and Durons as well as Pentium IV's.  I suppose I can come up with 
something else for the few very old machines I still have.

Subject: [PLUG] Working on building a Linux system from scratch...
Message-ID: <200307091957.AA1080754292@opusnet.com>

I'm going through Linux From Scratch version 4 
and am up to installing Perl in chapter 6.  
Looking ahead I wonder if I need the shadow 
password suite considering that my goal is to 
NFS export this system to network clients?  
Some where I've heard that shadow passwords 
and NFS don't work together.  Besides, I'd 
rather not use a local password database 
anyways.

Another thing I'm wondering is if I need 
autoconf, automake, m4, bin86, lilo, and
patch since I don't want to have compilers 
on this system and I don't want to set this
up as a system that I boot the host system 
up with?

I guess Flex is needed, along with bison...

I would like to authenticate network clients 
to to the passwords on my samba server before 
they are allowed to use my custom Linux system.

The real trick is figuring out how to turn 
this into a system that works via ramdisk and 
NFS mounts for multiple network clients 
simultaneously.  If I remeber right, there is 
a package for replacing the standard tmp dir 
in this situtation and a way to have seperate 
swap files created for each client.  I guess 
/usr would need to be exported read-only.

Can grub password protect and boot a network 
image?  Can grub be booted off a tftp server?  
Anyone have a recipe for doing this?

BTW:  I found the PXE client on my P4 but how 
      do I set up a PXE server
      on my Linux box?

Hi:

I attempted to look for a RealPlayer for my Linux box.  I downloaded one
from Real Networks a month ago and it seg fault on me.
Earlier today, I was at the OpenSource conference
and I got hold of the Helix DNA CD from the Real Network booth.
The CD contains a copy of the player.  Installed
and it still seg fault on me.  I am running RedHat 9 which I installed
about a month ago.

Any clue why the RealPlayer seg fault on me?

Thanks

Have you tried simply using -march=386?

Does invoking Realplay this way help?

    LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 realplay

Realplay will not run for me in RH9 until and unless this variable is set.

Good luck,

Piet,

 Early 1990s. I can find out what he had. OTOH, _any_ Mac with an optical
drive will (I assume) read the data off these disks so they can be

Didn't Wil already give you an answer for this question? Use -D.

If you're challenged with ipchains consider using iptables and the free
webmin (http://webmin.com) to set this up.

Heh, this is a pretty funny hack.

If you're generating dynamic content on a web page, you might be interested
in something that someone posted today on Perlmonks. It's a pair of
functions to take an IP address and a timestamp, then encrypt it against a
private key with Blowfish, turn it into ASCII... and back again.

Why would you want to do a thing like this? Well when you receive a spam
addressed to one of these addresses, you can determine who harvested you,
and when. You should be able to correlate that with your web log.  That
would be information that a lot of people would be interested in, methinks.

Anyway, the whole article is here, enjoy:

I've seen 1 or 2 webserver scripts that act as e-cards with some
premade greeting cards, but that's about it for Linux. You could
probably whip up a template in OpenOffice, or OpenOffice Impress,
that would do the job, then she could just drop in whatever clip art
she wanted.

Piet,

 Early 1990s. I can find out what he had. OTOH, _any_ Mac with an
optical

Do an rpm -ql gcc on a Redhat 7.x or newer system and the spec file under
/usr/lib/gcc... something is where you can optimize your compiler
flags.  Strangely though, having done nothing to the global compiler flags
I don't get it why with my Linux From Scratch system that it would by 
default be compiling to the architecture of the host system.  Morover, I'm 
curious what is involved in compiling Linux's libraries for multiple 
architectures: K6, PIII, PII, PI, Duron, Athlon, and 386.  Theoretically, 
I would think through cross compilation that I could have all the 
possibilities.  Then again, compiling for 386 should work everywhere 
where I probably don't need the optimization.  Are all architecture
optimizations contained in Linux's libraries or would having multiple
architecture compatibility ( within the same architecture family ) mean
that you have to have executables compiled in multiple ways?  This would
probably mean a slightly different filesystem structure with a full Linux 
Filesystem Standard tree for each architecture choice.  Setting this up
generically would probably be done most easily by doing multiple LFS 
systems in seperate partitions, one for each architecture.  Talk about 
massive waste :-(  I think autoconfigure is causing optimization to
the host system's architecture.

I had the kids make some "artwork" in one of the many paint programs,
then drop it into either OpenOffice, or The Gimp to finish the layout.

no, I only got a small square box, the title bar is (X

then I check the ps -ax, it has

Mozilla was working fine for me, I don't what's

I have LTSP working.  Is there a way to get access to a terminal's local drives?
Currently, the X terminals I get when I boot up LTSP are on the server and not
on my terminal even though they are displaying on my terminal.  In console mode
it seems like mount is broken.  Is this a network block devices problem?

As far as Linux From Scratch, I'm following version 4 from www.tldp.org and have
followed it verbatim.  It seems like it's optimizing for my host machine, a PIII.
What I don't want to do is I don't want to try doing Linux from scratch on my
386 DX-40 with only 20 megs of ram as that will be really slow.  Without changing
the defaults on a 386 configure would probably optimize for 386, there has to be
a better way though to accomplish this though.  I'm sure Redhat even though 
their binaries are probably compiled for a 386 doesn't actually use a 386, 
same for Mandrake and other Linux Distribution makers.

Since the tape drive isn't on this machine and this machine provides network booting
I should probably finish the instructions, no change, and use this from scratch 
system as an alternative boot option on this server for backing it up.  I'm stuck
with a dilemna though, I either need to figure out how to cross compile all the 
base utilities for a 386 or I need to determine how to gain access to a terminal's
drives under LTSP.

If I what to compress a root filesystem what goes in that filesystem
and for that matter has anyone done this with a modern 2.4 Linux system?
I'm thinking the root filesystem would be an initial ramdisk.  My goal
is to adapt Linux to be a ram based instead of a disk based system.

I have debian running on an iMac (the old purple one). Let me know if
you need config files or whatnot. Two problems I have:

1) remapping the keyboard to do dvorak 

2) eth0 stops working periodically /etc/init.d/networking restart
fixes it, so I have a cron job check every 2 min, however this would
not be tollerable on anything other than a convience machine (if any
one has reccomendations I'd love to hear them!).

Subject: [PLUG] Problems with Intel D845PEBT2
Message-ID: <200307102050.AA808649002@opusnet.com>

Will EMU do an exchange?  This is a fairly new system, about $718 
worth of new stuff that I picked up recently being last month.  
I want to get rid of it because I can't get DVD playback to work 
under Linux or Windows, it seems to have a device routing problem, 
and the sound card which I didn't know it would have built into it
doesn't work properly under Windows 98 even with the patch applied.

I've gotten it to play through a DVD by disabling onboard sound and 
installing a SB Live but it still doesn't buffer properly.  I know 
putting a movie I tried on it into my brother's G4 to verify this 
fact.  It wasn't the scratches on the DVD unless my player is more
sensitive than his.

The system has a 2.4 Ghz processor, $199
The D845PEBT2 motherboard was $145
I think the memory, 512 megs of DDR, was $69
...the case is around $59.
And I bought an 80 Gig Hitachi with it as 
well.

Disabling the sound and replacing it may be ok for Linux but I guess 
on the Windows side the only possibility left is XP where I'm really 
not interested in throwing good money after bad.  Is the Soundman 
Cadenza integrated into this board supported under Linux yet?  
Does anyone have any clue on how to get DVD playback to work 
smoothly on this board under any OS?

Does anyone know how to sell stuff on E-Bay?  I figure I can sell this 
stuff for $500 and pay my parents back for the hard drive and motherboard.
I'll just say that it isn't Linux compatible and that Windows 98 doesn't
very well on it unless you turn the onboard sound off and replace it.

There should be a warranty on these parts, maybe something's faulty.
I guess I need to look for the money order receipts.

     --  Michael C. Robinson

To whoever answered my question of what is 100% Linux compatible, 
assuming this board is, where can I get a driver for the onboard 
sound and will the 2.6 kernel for sure support the serial ATA 
controller?

Does anyone know if DVD's can be played under Linux on this board
or if XP can be installed stably to it?

Message-ID: <200307102349.AA292028686@opusnet.com>

Well, on a hunch I tried a DVD that isn't scratched.  It's looking more like
a sloppy programming issue for this Windows program, PowerDVD, more than 
anything.  My brother's G4 not only plays this scratched disc, it does it 
smoothly.  An unscratched DVD played just fine on my Pentium 4.  If it is 
a software issue I'll be wanting to find a program, hopefully a Linux one, 
to play DVD's on my PC that doesn't cause a crash when the disc is 
scratched.  It could be that my DVD player has been too heavily used and 
I'm wearing the laser out, I don't know how I can test that though.  Is 
there advanced technology in newer DVD drives to smooth out playback of 
scratched discs or does Apple just write better DVD player software?

Another possibility is that Lassie is a lower density DVD than the Tarzan 
and Jane DVD I tried.  I wonder if there are different grades of DVD's?  
Is a platinum DVD a grade of DVD or an advertising ploy?

The next thing I ought to try is taking my SB Live out and see if I can 
get the same results using a good DVD with the onboard sound system.  
Linux detects the SoundMaker Cadenza that's built in but generates 
a ton of error messages like it can't find the resources for it or 
something.  The onboard sound of the D815EEA2 is supported under 
Linux, maybe it's just a matter of time for the Cadenza.

This may not be it, however in the past working with Redhat on a 
Pentium III I've noticed that changing the network settings in the 
sysconfig files and then doing a network restart won't change the 
active system settings from those the config files had in them at 
boot.  However, if you manually use ifconfig, route, etc. you can 
enter the new settings manually.  Of course if you reset your files 
those settings will be affective when you reboot also.  BTW, many 
times I've caused a router to stop working by turning off forwarding 
or downing a masquerading firewall.  Usually sysctl, look at 
/etc/stysctl.conf, is configured to turn forwarding off.  The init 
scripts are also good culprits for this where for firewalling, 
especially when taking one down, turning off forwarding and downing 
interfaces is a very good idea.

As always, assume any network conectivity problem is a bad cable or 
other media problem before thinking it's your Linux box.  It may be 
that you have high packet loss somewhere and that resetting your 
networking is cancelling a long retransmit loop.  One thing to look 
out for is an intersection of unshielded network cable and a large 
transformer.  If you have this situation, try wrapping the patch 
cable in aluminum foil to shield it.  With ping there is a flood
option, look at your packet loss when your interface works.  If
you make your own patch cables go buy one instead, they're not 
expensive and stranded wire is less likely to break than the 
solid core stuff that's bought in bulk.

Oh, watch out for 100 megabit/second nics that for some reason
won't run at 10mbits/s under Linux even on low speed hubs.  
I ran into this problem with Intel Etherexpress pro 10/100
builtin cards.  The only solution I've ever found was to 
connect to a 100 mbit/s switch instead of a low speed hub
from these machines.

I've had problems on macs with the arp table just "forgetting" about the
network.  Can you see if that's the case?  A cron job that sends a single
ICMP packet to the gateway every few minutes has always done the trick.

Pain in the ass, but better than restarting the interface.

Not all 10/100 cards are auto-sensing.

Many of these cards have a soft-switch that needs to be flipped for your
network connection.  There's usually a DOS utility that'll update the
eeprom with the settings for your network.

Oh, and get a journal or a blog or something, ferchrissakes.

The first problem that I see is that -UIlocal is not a valid argument 
for Mozilla.  It should be ignored, but I suppose it could cause 
problems.  Try "-UIlocale en-US".

Also, Mozilla is usually started from the mozilla shell script which is 
usually located in the same directory as mozilla-bin.   Find the script 
`locate "mozilla" | grep "mozilla$"` and try and start with the script.  
To see if you are getting any errors, start Mozilla from a terminal 
window. 

If it still is not working, the problem could be that your user profile 
is damaged.  Mozilla stores user-level configurations in a .mozilla 
directory in the users $HOME.  You can move the profile to a backup 
location (e.g., mv $HOME/.mozilla $HOME/.moz.bak) and start mozilla 
again.  This will require you to recreate your preferences, but will 
also enable you to copy preferences like bookmarks.

My wife was interested in this stuff at one point.  I found this "plugins
package" for The Gimp... and it was the closest thing to that I ever found. 
(Never did try them out... she'd lost interest by the time I found 'em.)

Graphics Muse

There is a wierd licensing deal with it though... it's a CD you have to buy.
There is GPL stuff on it, which he says is freely redistributable of course. 
But the stuff he wrote (the plugins) aren't.  He has a page explaining
everything.  A little different, but not too bad a deal.

Message-ID: <E19b0QV-0007Rg-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

Hi.
I have a mailserver running RH 8.0 and sendmail. It's running mimedefang,
spamassassin, clam antivirus. It works pretty great, considering.

I recently suggested to our editors (article editors for a scrapbooking website)
that we let people email them feedback. And of course they love the idea, but
they get "a lot of email already" and they would like to know if it's feasible
to get "digests."

Now, I'm sure I could write a bash script, or a perl script, that would combine
the email for a set time period into one email and mass-mail them like a digest.
You know the sort of thing I'm thinking about. But, naturally, that would take time.

Is there some relatively easy program/script/command that'll combine email
messages into one message and email them to a second and third recipient?

Thank you for your time.

Hi 

Thank you for your reply.

(1)I did use "-UIlocal en-US".
(2)I also start mozilla from the terminal window, by
using "/usr/bin/mozilla", same thing happened.
(3)Then I try "mv /root/.mozilla /root/.maz.bak", and
start the mozilla from /usr/bin/mozilla, nothing came
out. How can I recreate the preference?

Was there any error in the terminal window when you used it to launch 
Mozilla? 

Some thoughts:

Perhaps the mozilla shell script doesn't like being in a different 
directory that the mozilla-bin executable which is probably not in your 
$PATH.  Either correct the script, add the mozilla-bin executable to 
your $PATH, or try calling mozilla-bin without the locale syntax, or 
with the correct syntax for locale.

It looks as though you are using an RPM build of Mozilla.  The files are 
being put into non-standard, annoying places.  Remove the current 
installation and try using either a compiled version from Mozilla.Org or 
compile your own mozilla distribution.  I have written a Mozilla 
Optimization for Linux mini-HOWTO which you can find at tldp.org

Also, please tell me that you are not always logged in as root on your box.

Hehe, it turns out there is a macro, and it's called __FUNCTION__.

Hmm.. well __FUNCTION__ seems to work under gcc and MSVC. In fact, MSVC 
supports a macro for the decorated function name as well (FUNCDNAME), which
wouldn't be possible at all with a traditional preprocessor; there must
be several cycles of preprocessing and compilation to accomodate this.

I am using RPM to build the Mozilla, I am going to
remove the current installation since it has damaged
anyway. I will try the compiled version and go to
tldp.org get some information. Thank you very much.

I was introduced yesterday to Gina Blaber, director of conferences for
O'Reilly.  She said they were very happy with Portland and are strongly
considering having it here next year.  She recommended that I fill out a
response form and encourage everyone in the local user groups to do so
too.  So, if you'd like to see OSCON here again next year, fill out this
form and let O'Reilly know:

(Also, if you know other groups that aren't in my To: header, would you

Subject: [PLUG] Athlon gotcha...
Message-ID: <200307111109.AA780665024@opusnet.com>

I've been looking on E-Bay for a 1 Ghz Athlon to put on a FIC Aspen 2
motherboard and have discovered that the one I'm bidding on has a 266mhz
front side bus where the ASPEN2 board I want to put it on only supports 
up to 200mhz FSB.  The question I have is, will the 266mhz FSB version 
of the Athlon work on this board?

I'm bidding half on prcoessor and fan for the 1 gigahertz Athlon with 266 mhz
front side bus that I can get a 1 gigahertz Athlon with 200 mhz front side
bus and no fan for buy it now.  The former is only six months used where the 
latter is probably refurb.
 
Maybe someone will still outbid me for the 1 Ghz Athlon 266 mhz FSB at which
point I can just get the other in case I need the other.

I had no idea there were multiple versions of the Athlon operating at the
same cpu clock speed with different internal bus speeds.

I don't know the answer off-hand because I've always bought my chips
with the MoBo at the same time and place. I'd recommend going to
www.overclockers.com or some similar hardware enthusiasts' page if you
can't get an answer here.

Maybe, but most likely not at 1 ghz. If the FSB is changed, then the 
multiplier would also be different to maintain the same CPU speed. At 
266 FSB, a 1ghz chip would have a 4X multiplier to get to 1ghz. At 4x 
multiplier, a 200 FSB chip would run at 800 mhz.

Both AMD and Intel do this. The PIII 800 is available in both a 100 and 
133 mhz FSB version. I'm sure there are others, but that's one I've delt 
with.

Subject: [PLUG] Trouble with my LFS bootup...
Message-ID: <200307111136.AA791544000@opusnet.com>

I finished the directions for Linux From Scratch version 4 but must have made some mistake somewhere...
I get two boot time errors:

*  One is that the kernel can't exec modprobe, although there's no zip 
   drive plugged in and I haven't created a modules.conf or conf.modules 
   file.

   kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k scsi_hostadapter, errno = 2

*  The other error is that /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc.sysinit can't be executed.  
   I'm doing system V style init.

Do I need a link for /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit?  Right now there isn't a file 
called rc.sysinit but there is a rcsysinit.d directory.

I'm trying out devfs, 2.4.19 kernel, my root partition
is mounting read only and if the rc.sysinit events aren't
happening that's probably why it doesn't get remounted 
read/write.

The second problem is probably why I'm getting a troubleshooting prompt
after a long hang at starting system logging daemon...

Otherwise, I'm fairly close to having this system booting up normal.  
I get this going maybe I can adapt it to network boot workstations for 
restoration purposes.  At the very least it'll make a nice system for
backing up the host server's main Redhat install.  

I don't have iptables so I'll just put this system on a private class C 
I'm not routing through my gateways and set up an alias on my tape server.
The latter makes more sense because I'm only going to use this system
for backup/restore within my local lan where I wouldn't want to be able to
access or be accessed from the Internet.  Can you run different ip networks
through the same media though?

I've seen this too.  Sometimes nothing will happen if other instances of 
mozilla are already running--no error or anything. (A bug). Type

# killall mozilla-bin

Could be, but my guess is that the mouse protocol is set incorrectly, or
you've got an IRQ sharing problem with your USB controller.

I haven't set up an USB mouse, yet, so I don't know exactly what to look
for.

Good Luck,

Yes, you can run just about any number of networks through the same
media. I do it all of the time.

If your home network is on a switch, you will keep the privacy you
desire unless someone from out in the Internet manages to gain control
of an internet-connected box and tells it to sniff everything on the
wire. (Since a hub repeats all traffic on all ports, a third-party-owned
computer could capture the private traffic.)

If you're using hubs rather than switches, you will still find that your
collision domain encompases all the devices hooked to the hub in
addition to the small security risk I mentioned above.

So this Athlon at 266 mhz FSB may not take a 5x multiplier at at 200Mhz
internal clock speed.  On the other hand, if it will run stably at 800Mhz
I'm perfectly happy with that as my other two PIII servers only do 866 :-)  
The motherboard even after shipping is only $16 with a 30 day return 
warranty to boot.

You may need rules to allow ssh to your external interface and it's
important to realize that ssh itself does it's own blocking apart
from what iptables does at the packet level.  Ssh needs to be 
configured to allow connections from the outside.

It's not a preprocessor macro. Try for yourself, write out preprocessor
output (gcc -E), you'll see that __LINE__ is replaced by a number but
__FUNCTION__ is still there. __FUNCTION__ is a GCC-ism. The replacement
of __FUNCTION__ by the function name is done by the compiler. GCC is not the
only compiler which knows this, HP C/C++ compiler can do it, so can Intel
compiler, but not Sun compiler. Also, they differ slightly in what they
return as function name, in some cases.
BTW, if __FUNCTION__ works, odds are __func__works too.

I'm having a heck of a time with my D845PEBT2 and I'm wondering if there is a CD or
something that Intel puts out or maybe even someone else for that matter that will
fully test the board, memory, etc. so that I know I don't have a hardware problem
before I assume I'm dealing with software issues.

It looks like __func__ is an ANSI C99 addition, so it would be 
preferable to __FUNCTION__, correct?

Btw, it appears MSVC does not support __func__, although VC7 
supports __FUNCTION__.

Hmm...  Well, I'm using Arno's IPTables Firewall Script:
http://freshmeat.net/projects/iptables-firewall/?topic_id=151

I modified the config file to allow connections to port 22/tcp|udp, but I
still can't SSH in.  So I thought that maybe having NAT enabled would make
connections directly to the box impossible from the outside...  any NAT
experts out there?

This is a good way to test and exercise the memory/CPU:

No, NAT shouldn't interfere with SSH'ing to the box that's doing the 
NATing, but there could be some other iptables setting that are 
interfering with SSH. You should be able to track this down by adding 
some iptables logging rules just prior to the equivalent deny rules.

No, but it doesn't necessarily matter.  PCI devices can share
interrupts, and, I think, be assigned their interrupts when they're
initialized (boot-time usually).  So there are plenty of places where
the hardware itself may be fine, but the drivers might have bugs.  What
does /proc/interrupts look like?

Message-ID: <20030711214949.59749.qmail@web10909.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I am using RedHat 9.0 for my linux server, eth0
(192.168.0.1)is for the external, eth1(172.16.1.) is
for internal  and using dhcp/iptables to connect among
the internal networking.
My Samba server version is 2.2.7a-7.9.0. I tried to
make my samba server/client work for my external as
well as internal through dhcp (iptables) setting, my
iptables and dhcp are working fine so far which allows
me to browse the internet from internal networking.

Any help for this samba setting will be appreciated.

m.y.

It's really really hard to predict attendance.  They know some of the
big names will have big draws, but it's hard to predict size just
looking at an abstract.

It is possible to change the multiplier, but it requires physical
modification of the CPU (adding and subtracting conducting paths). 
tomshardware.com has done it several times.

I'm currently pinging my router every 2 minutes with 1 packet, if the
ping dosen't return in 3 seconds, I restart the interface.  When the
network goes down everything dies, so I think it's a bit more drastic
than that :(.

Start with www.memtest86.com, let that run over night, or a couple of
hundred passes, which ever comes first.  Once you have confidence in
your memory, the other weirdness should start making sense.

Good Luck,

I've tried a good dozen cables, different paths to the router (eg: up
the stairs rather than through the wall), direct connections via
crossover cables, home made cable and store bought, and various ports
on the switch (which is of the 10/100 auto-sensing full duplex
variety, but not managed), none of which seems to affect the problem.

There is no power in the walls near the cables in question (I built
the house), and the only electronic devices near the wall are 2 crts.

0% packet loss when it is behaving, tested with almost 300,000
packets. (279701 packets transmitted, 279655 packets received)

The interface works at spec, when it is working.

They're hard to find but Intel's site has Linux drivers for the motherboard components
that otherwise won't work under Redhat 8 and 9.  There are also drivers for two of the
suse releases.  Don't know if these are binaries, probably.  I'm not complaining 
though :-)  The Intel drivers may make the sound card work, optimize the nic, and
improve agp.

Tom's hardware also reviewed a hardware device this week that would sit
between the CPU and the socket and make these conductor changes without
cutting or soldering on the chip.

You can also look at the /etc/ssh/sshd.conf ListenAddress entry. If it's
not commented out it should be 0.0.0.0 (all networks). If your going to
do this on a firewall I would recommend that you not allow interactive
authentication but instead stick to key based ssh2.

Melinda, am I to understand that you want to expose your samba server to
an external network? If so, is this external network directly connected
to the Internet?

I figured it out...  the Arno's IPTables script was blocking access to the
external interface from private IP ranges.  This was a firewall behind
another firewall and I had the external using 192.168.x.x and the internal
using 172.16.x.x.
Thanks to everyone that offered their help.

There was a session specifically about that subject.  

http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2003/view/e_sess/4528

It was dominated by Lawrence Rosen, as well it should be as the subject
matter was about law.

His basic conclusion was this was more a case about law than code, that
the press had really done a great job of blowing it's importance
completely out of the water, and that IBM really had little to fear.

He stressed the absolutely minor significance of the letters sent out by
SCO.  He pointed out a letter is $.37.  Pretty cheap FUD.  If SCO
can scare one company into sending them money or to stop using Linux and
switch to Unixware, then the letters would pay for themselves.  

There was also an interesting interchange between him and Eric S.
Raymond about copyrighting code.  Rosen wanted everything done in a very
strict clear legal sense.  Raymond pointed out the more hoops that
developers have to jump through to publish code as Open Source, the less
developers will do it.

There you go--you've got all this stuff on IRQ 9.  Check your BIOS and
see if you can convince some of these devices to use other IRQs.

The internal mouse is probably PS/2 and already has its own IRQ.

Have you thought about setting up a mailing list where your editor(s) is
the only member, but non-members are allowed to post and then setting that
member to digest mode?

Kludgy, but it would work.

You could always ssh into a machine behind your
firewall, then ssh from there to your firewall's
internal IP address.

Hi

Sorry to confuse you, I have 2 layers of network, the
192.168.0.1 is the external for the 2nd network but is
the internal for the 1st network, so it is not
connected to the Internet directly.

Hi,

I installed Red Hat 7.3 on a laptop with an 'ATI Radeon IGP 320M'

ATI's website does not list any Linux device drivers for their adapter,
and I can't find anything on the web.

Can anyone help? please?

No problem, I missed the fact that both networks were IANA non-routable,
the class B usage is a little less common.

Open port 137 and 138 udp and port 139 tcp on the firewall between these
2 internal networks. That should allow file share access from your other
network.

Hope that helps.

All those free IRQ's, and 9 gets loaded up, go figure.

Is ACPI enabled in your kernel?  Is eth0 built in, or can you remove
it?  Is there anyway to convince the BIOS to reassign IRQ's?

Good Luck,

Well, I attended the panel discussion on the SCO Group vs. IBM lawsuit --
which got several write-ups on various internet news sites, which will
tell you most of what was said -- & managed to snag a minute or two of
Larry Rosen's time to get some clarifications, so maybe I can offer
something about this case of interest.

(And I have to say that this panel discussion was not the most interesting
presentation at OSCON; even the panelists appeared a little embarassed
at participating, & stated that they didn't have any new information that
hasn't been masticated into a tasteless pulp by the press. I'd say the
one presenter who had something to say, & packed the room every time
he spoke was Robert Lefkowitz, whose presentations on Open Source &
business were thoughtful, well-researched, & entertaining. As soon as
his slides are put on the O'Reily site, GET them.)

Two things that the news write-ups omitted about what the panel said
about this case were these:

(1) Larry Rosen was largely dismissive of the case & its effect on Linux,
being quite emphatic about the fact that until the SCO Group's claims of
trade secrets is more clearly defined as discovery proceeds, we shouldn't
assume this is anything more than a pissing match between the SCO Group &
IBM. Rosen stated that it's clear the SCO Group is ``making a Hail Mary
play" by suing IBM.

(2) Bradley M. Kuhn of the FSF commented that the code of the software
they own is free of any possible IP taint because they actively vet all
people who contribute code to their project: making sure that the individual
either clearly owns the contributed code, or has his employer's permission
to give it; & verifying that the contributor either is old enough to
legally consent to a contract, or has her/his parents' consent in making
a contribution. While Kuhn further insisted that FSF's ownership of the
code was a Good Thing, Rosen disagreed with him on that point -- but
agreed it was important to vet the coders to be even more careful that
code doesn't get contributed that shouldn't be there.

Eric Raymond spoke up & stated in a blustery fashion that he thought
vetting contributors was a Bad Thing, & any limits on people contributing
code would affect the quality of the project. But then again, I've long
ago come to the conclusion that Raymond mostly likes to hear himself
talk (even more than me), & tuned him out within 30 seconds into his spiel.
I did see him at the conference, but I didn't bother to say anything to
him (I didn't see the point of telling him what I thought to his face after
he had travelled all this way), so about the only thing I learned from
seeing him was that in the flesh he bore an amazing resemblance to Lon
Mabon (whom I've happened to also have seen in the flesh).

As for Rosen's comments to me, they emphasised & clarified his thoughtful
opinion that, so far, this lawsuit is Just Another Lawsuit Between Two
Corporations. He stated it was his belief the SCO Group sent out those
1500 letters concenring Linux in an attempt to put pressure on IBM to
settle out of court. (He stated at the panel he's perfectly happy to
send out letters on his law firm's stationary to compel people to
stop behavior, & if it works, great.) So far, there is nothing out of
the ordinary about this lawsuit: neither IBM nor the SCO Group are doing
anything remarkable (except that the SCO Group has managed by its acts
to make itself the most hated high-tech company in the world -- making
Microsoft a distant second, at best), and the case will take a few
years to grind its way to a conclusion. Until the facts of the actual
code MacBride et alia claim have been put into the Linux kernel are
identified, one shouldn't lose sleep about this case. Although it doesn't
hurt to keep an eye on events . . .

As for outside that panel discussion . . . I have to say this case was
probably most noticeable by its absense: eavesdropping on conversations,
the most common topic appeared to be either ``Man, Wednesday night was
a killer party" or ``Hey, take a look at this code". Yes, there was the
guy with yellow hair who had the words FSCK SCO painted in red on the
back of his head, but he was quite unusual.

  Thanks, Geoff and the others who responded. As an interested bystander who
has detailed knowledge of how the news media -- particularly newspapers --
play up issues just to generate sales, I wondered if there was anything new
happening. Now I know the answer is, "no". We are now in that protracted
stage where the lawyers keep billing by the hour so as to meet their 90%
billability requirements. This will continue until one party or the other
either tires of throwing away money or goes broke. Then the case will be
settled and everyone will claim victory.

Message-ID: <1058024909.31048.751.camel@sparticus>

I wrote this simple bash script (oh, how I pined for 'emerge pdksh') to
convert exported IE bookmarks to Galeon. It turns this:

  [DEFAULT]
  BASEURL=http://accounts.keybank.com/
  [InternetShortcut]
  URL=http://accounts.keybank.com/
  Modified=E064CB6ECCAEC201BA

Into this...

  <bookmark href="http://accounts.keybank.com/">
    <title>Key Bank - Online Banking</title>
  </bookmark>

Simply change the top two variables to suit your needs and place the
output in your ~.galeon/bookmarks.xbel file.

 May you find it useful...

I wouldn't look for this to work unless your using TCP for netbios name
and netbios datagram services on your SMB server. Samba, as well as
other SMB servers, normally implement netbios name and datagram services
(port 137 and 138) over UDP. Your opening port 137 and 138 over TCP
here, this is the -p TCP option in the iptables commands that your
script is executing. From looking at your example, it would be possible
to duplicate some of the entries in order to split out port 137:138 from
port 139 with a protocol (-p) of UDP and alter the existing -p TCP
entries to do only port 139.

It would look something like this:


if [ $SMB_CLIENT -gt 0 ]; then

iptables -A OUTPUT -o $EXTERNAL_INTERFACE -p UDP \
--sport $UNPRIVPORTS --dport 137:138 -s $EXTERNAL_IP -d $ANYWHERE -j ACCEPT

iptables -A OUTPUT -o $EXTERNAL_INTERFACE -p TCP \
--sport $UNPRIVPORTS --dport 139 -s $EXTERNAL_IP -d $ANYWHERE -j ACCEPT


Now further down in the script you are matching state with the -m state
option and I don't think that this is going to be valid for UDP entries,
UDP is a connectionless protocol. You can try but if you get an error
then you'll have to remove the state match.

Hi:

I just attempted to run an Mpeg player on my RH9 box.
I wanted to play an Mpeg 1 video segment.
The player (mpegtv) complains that the colormap is
full.  It brought up the video but the screen is blury
and beyond watchable condition.

Is there a trick on how Linux handles colormap that I can specify something
into my XFree86 config?    Any tip/pointer much appreciated.

I do have a older scsi controller card- not sure of

Also, are man tar and man gzip my friends here? Or is
there a good software pkg out there?

I've been using DDS units to backup for a while and haven't had any problems 
related to DDS.  I'm using afbackup for my backup program.  It supports 
client server architecture, multiple backups at the same time, and I can 
backup through a ssh tunnel which is pretty cool.

Sounds like you want to increase your colordepth.
You might have to lower your resolution, though.
Be sure to make a backup of your /etc/X11/XF86Config
before you start fiddling with it.

As I said in another email, probably the best presenter at OSCON was
Robert Lefkowitz, who although admittedly a suit from Wall Street, not
only did his homework & was an excellent speaker, also understood
the technical side of Open Source. He promised to turn over his
slides for O'Reilly to put on their web site, but until then you
can get an idea of his presentation ``The Missing Open Source Projects"
at http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3501.

Heck, anyone who understands why you want to get reduce your dependence
on Computer Associates gets positive marks in my book!

I can do that with /bin/tar too, e.g.:

  mt -f /dev/nst0 setblk 32768
  mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind
  ssh -l root <remote-hostname> 'tar -C / -clf - .' | dd of=/dev/nst0 obs=32768

It sounds like you need to enable USB in your kernel, and/or support
for "preliminary USB device filesystem", also in the kernel.

I think you can just set

# RSH=`which ssh`
# export RSH

and then use

# tar cf hostname:/dev/ntape0

At least, this is the way dump(8) works and I think GNU tar implements
it too.

I'll leave the software side to the many experts who are exponentially 
smarter than me for all things tar, shell, ssh, and dd.

I would make one recommendation.  Please make sure that the DDS2 format is 
sufficient for your needs.  2/4gb may seem okay on the face of it, but 
that capacity can be easily surpassed by future needs.   I'd expect you to 
be able to find a DDS3 (12/24 gb) for $150 or so.  But then again, I 
haven't looked lately so I may be talking out my ass.  Heck for the cost 
of the drives and media, DVD +R/+RW seems to be shaping up as the 
defacto standard for DVD discs and another method for backup.  Might want 
to check this out.

Okay, cool.  Question  I have is are your backing up the system 
your currently running or do you have to switch to another system 
to backup the one your currently running which has network support?  
I'm trying to use a Linux from scratch system as a second system to 
switch to to backup my main one.  Is there a way to bring the main 
system down to runlevel 1 and a second Linux system up to runlevel 
3 without rebooting the computer?  Are there flags for tar and dump 
to allow backing up full the current running system at runlevel 
3 or 5 without dropping to runlevel 1?

I assume rmt needs rsh and it looks like rsh can be set to ssh.

As far as tape backup, I just got 4 DI30 tapes Verbatim generics for 
around $100 which are supposed to be able to store 30 megs a piece of 
2:1 compressed data.

The tapes are expernsive but I got the drive for $150.  The secret is to 
buy at least six tapes if you get a DI30 drive now.  Everything else I've 
looked at for tape drives appears to be in the $800 to $1000+ range.  
Some models may be changers though I've heard strong recommendations to 
stay away from Travans.  The thing about libraries, tape drives that hold 
multiple tapes, is that you can't span a dump over multiple tapes.  The 
latter can supposedly be solved by using the fcut utility with tar to 
cut a large dump into pieces that will fit on individual tapes.  With 
tape drives you can either have cheap media or a cheap drive.  If you 
can afford it, an expensive drive is probably the better way to go as 
the whole point of a tape system over say hard drives is being able to 
buy a lot of tapes and do multiple backups.  Well, tapes supposedly
last longer and hold up better than hard drives too :-)

IBM has a technology called honeycomb and I imagine with a sheet of steel
and the proper laser you could manipulate atoms on the steel plate and store 
an incredible amount of data that way.  The latter technology may end up
being similar to a CD-R technology, then again it's not that hard to recycle
a plate of steel to a fresh mirror finish and reuse it.

Thanks for the replies-

Sounds like I'll have plenty of options with programs/scripts.

Good advice on the size, but in this case, money matters
and 2-4gb is plenty big enough.

Ok, off to ebay- I've got some to learn there too. Seems to be a
big difference in shipping ($8 -vs- $20) and warranty (AS-IS -vs-
7-30 day moneyback).


Thanks again,

Jon

Yeah, a DVD writer runs about $300:
http://www.pcclub.com/product_detail.cfm?itemno=A1558705

Media is cheap (about $2/disc) and I've started offering it customers as
a backup solution for low-end systems.  The backup software I sell also
supports it: http://nakedape.cc/products/software/microlite

Hey Dirk,

Which Olympus? Mine is a C-700 and it mounts as a usb mass storage
device (SCSI emulation) but I know some do require a driver.

WRT to your assertions about tape libraries, I beg to differ.  The 96 
slot, 4 drive library I manage does span volumes quite nicely, thank you.  
This is a function the software that does the backup and not the hardware 
platform that does it.

Dirk,

Does your RH9 machine include the following in /etc/fstab:

    none  /proc/bus/usb    usbdevfs  noauto    0 0

Also, when you run "lsmod | grep -i usb", what do you get?  Here is my output
for reference:

    # lsmod | grep -i usb
    usb-storage            68628   0
    scsi_mod              106200   4  [usb-storage sg sd_mod ide-scsi]
    usb-uhci               25868   0  (unused)
    usbcore                77696   1  [usb-storage printer hid usb-uhci]

If I understand correctly, the script /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit is responsible for
taking care of getting the modules loaded and mounting the /proc/bus/usb
directory at boot time.  

Marc

Message-ID: <20030714055908.29987.qmail@web12505.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,
         I am brand new to this whole linux thing. 
The main reason I use my computer is for midi
sequencing.  I have a program called jazz that I got
off of a cd.  I tried to install it, but when I try to
run it, I get a message telling me to set the
environment variable.  I tried to do this based on the
instructions in a text file in the program, and also
from a lycos tutorial, but have been unable to get it
to run.  I would realy like to be able to use the
sequencing program.  Any sugestions or advice?

Thanks

Which environment variable is it asking you to set?  Assuming you're
using bash you would set it like this:  export VARIABLE_NAME=foo

You can try the getting-started howto on www.tldp.org to learn some
of the essentials to managing a linux system.

You have opened a hole from all hosts/all networks coming in from source
port 80 and you need to open the destination port 80. 

The line should look like this:

#ipchains -A input -s 0.0.0.0/0 1025:65535 -d my.web.server.ip 80 -j
ACCEPT

This will allow traffic from any host/any network, destined for WWW, to
cross the INPUT chain.

I've had problems with older DDS units.  In addition to the slow write
speed, the tapes seem to develop bad blocks a bit too frequently for my
needs.

I would suggest that you look into using a CD-R drive.  The write speed
can be quite high now, and I've had excellent luck with them being
readable even years down the road.

I use "dump" since I like the interactive restore feature, and it's
cheap.  (free)

I've got running shares on RH, passwords are encrypted on the system, XP

Googling the problem, I find similar problems, no solutions. It's been

Do you have the RH box set up as the WINS server?

Did you turn off the Browse Master service on the XP box?

There is a utility called "Browmon" that might help sort this out.  I
think I downloaded it from M$.

Good Luck,

No the RH box is not a WINS server, It's just a simple small TCP/IP 
network, no DHCP even.


I'm looking, but I have not found out how to turn off the browswmaster 
switch here, it's not under file and print sharing on this PC...

Letting the RH box be the WINS server, and telling all other
workstations about it, will probably straighten things out.  Make sure
the OS level is greater than 128.

It's a registry setting.  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, System, CurrentControlSet,
Services, Browser.  Set the IsBrowseMaster and MaintainList to "false".

Hi folks -

What is the Vim equivalent of "M-x q" under Emacs? For example what
command in Vim will format a paragraph of ragged lines, like this:

"Storm Claudette took 
aim for the Texas coast Monday slightly farther north then expected, 
prompting a 
hurricane 
warning from Baffin"

Any pointers on how to search for this sort of thing in the vim docs?

I use 'gqap' in command mode, with the cursor anywhere in the paragraph.

Or, in the spirit of "there's more than one way to do things":

  !}fmt

which will pipe the following paragraph though the fmt(1) utility.

Subject: [PLUG] USB Interrupts - Chunky Mouse
Message-ID: <3F132943.5060700@ardware.net>

So I have determined that my chunky mouse behavior is caused
by the overloading of my interrupt 9 with way too many
devices.

I did some research and one source said that it's impossible to
reassign interrupts on my machine, a Sony Vaio FX220 laptop.

Is this true, or is there a magical way to offload some of the
tasks onto another interrupts?  Below is what /proc/interrupts
contains.


Thanks

I shouldn't respond lest this quickly devolve into a vi-vs-emacs flame
war, but most people map the necessary keystrokes.  Mine is mapped to
CTRL-K.

.vimrc:
map <C-K> j{!}fmt -w76 -u<cr>}

Only XP Pro. Did you make sure that all packet filtering in the network
adapter on the XP box is disabled? Have you loaded the MS Network Client
on the XP box? Are you attaching to the right workgroup?

Are you using Samba as a primary domain controller? XP Home will not connect 
to a domain.

Subject: [PLUG] ATA vs. SCSI
Message-ID: <16648-65976@sneakemail.com>

At the risk of inviting this age-old flame-war to once again visit PLUG, I
had to pass along a really interesting article I found.  As the authors
are from Seagate, one can expect it to be biased towards the more
expensive drives, but I found the discussion to be quite
interesting.  It also has extensively documented references.

The article can be found at:

http://www.seagate.com/content/docs/pdf/whitepaper/D2c_More_than_Interface_ATA_vs_SCSI_042003.pdf

or

ftp://ftp.gutenpress.org/mbrs/sean/ATA_vs_SCSI.pdf

The article doesn't discuss the effects of RAID on overall
reliability/performance, though they do discuss how "consumer" grade
disks are designed around single-disk enclosures and suffer more problems
from the vibrations of other disks around them than "enterprise" grade
disks.

I found it via a current slashdot article here:

http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/13/0349206

I hope some of you find it as interesting as I did.

Subject: [PLUG] Spamassassin, procmail, and wtf
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.52.0307141919050.25591@shaft.bitmine.net>

My mail.log is filled with these:

Jul 14 19:18:01 shaft spamc[27170]: connect() to spamd failed: Connection refused

(The hostname is "shaft".)

So I have to ask, wtf?

I'm invoking spamc in procmail as per some howto somewhere or other:
:0fw
| /usr/bin/spamc

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
IN.spam

I don't even know where to begin and I don't have a graphical browser at
home anymore (why, oh why isn't there a good framebuffer browser?), so
websearching is not turning up much usable info.

Any help appreciated,
J.

"tf" is that spamd's not running.

I'm having a hell of a time figuring out why, though.
/etc/init.d/spamassassin start
gives no output.

Duh.  Having a very slow day today.

No need to comment on this one.  I got it.

BUT once I get procmail doing the right thing with spamassassin, how do I
feed uncaught spam back into the thing to teach the filter?

Then how do I integrate it with sendmail?

There is no magical way, but there are some things to try.  Turning off
ACPI support might do it (beware that your win2k might not boot). 
Turning off "Assign IRQ to USB" might do it.  Changing slots with your
eth0 device might do it.  Sometimes you need to enable a reset or
reassignment.  A new, freshly rolled kernel might do it too.  Isn't plug
and pray fun?

Good Luck,

The sa-learn command was what was missing.

I assume it has some kind of --good option to counteract the --spam
option.

I got that part.  Sorry for the posts.  I was in Shepard-mode.

I write that because he says he procmailed me to /dev/null and I think
it's funny to talk about someone behind their back right under their nose.

I have a question now.  How does this command tell spamassassin to learn
what it missed?  I'm assuming that is what you are telling it correct? 
Did you move the ones it missed to a particular location and run
spamassassin against that dir?  This would be helpfull for the last bits
it is missing from mine as well.

thanks,

Josh

It pipes the message into sa-learn.

Yep.  :)

I also have a cron job that runs that looks like this:

## Rebuild Bayesian database for SpamAssassin
##
30  1 * * * root  /usr/local/bin/sa-learn --rebuild


Since I'm telling it not to rebuild since, from the sounds of it, is
somewhat time-consuming.

Thank you.  I just read more up on the process and understand it better. 
Curious though.  It says using the DB is very CPU intensive.  Does that
mean the SA will get worst and worst as the DB builds?  Seems very counter
productive if that is the case.

One clarification.  You use 'macro index \cb' and not being familiar with
this, does this result in all messages in the cd directory to be handed to
SA one at a time to be 'learnt'?  Can I just feed it a file of my email
messages?  example:  /home/josh/mail/learn_spam

I see sa-learn has the argument -mbox and -file but not sure if that means
the type of files that are directories like the mail is stored.

Thanks again.  This sounds promising but the CPU drain warning seems very
threatening to proformance.

I don't think you need to do that if you're running 2.55; it's supposed
to handle auto-expiration and stuff a lot better than the previous
couple.  Ah, maybe so.

Also, I recommend to anyone using SA that you also install Razor2 and
DCC.  I just recently added DCC and updated from Razor1 to Razor2 and
I've cut out almost all of that 10% of spam I was missing.

Is anyone keeping track of their SA scores, such as for the high score
competition? 
http://news.spamassassin.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=25&mode=nested&order=1&thold=0

I've only been paying attention for a couple of days, but I've already
got one 47.10.

One thing I was never clear on.   All the messages that SA catches, do
we have to save those to continue to teach SA?  Or do they automatically
get added to the spam heuristics?

I saw some things about Razor2.  Not sure what they all are but is it a
service that send off the email to validate if spam?

Also my highest hit of the email that is sitting in my trash from Spam
currently is only 40.80.  It was going to cure me of my depression.  Now
that is funny.  I'm never depressed.  :-)

The Corvallis Senior Center might be a good pace for that; it has a

not any acquaintance with Linux so therefore maybe its own interest in

Well, there was an "or" in there.  :^)

Seriously, I hope they at least try.
The more obscure topics probably draw smaller numbers.
Yet php5, webDAV, LPDAP, Python, etc were in SMALL rooms!

Marriot seemed to have rooms for 25 + SRO, then rooms for 200, then for 500.. or 
something like that.  Sounds like an interesting problem.  I could write a perl

Anyway, your point IS well-taken.  I put mine on the conf eval.

     I found that on thursday more than 1/2 of the talks that I tried

     people on the floor.

     I did put my disappointment on the eval.

     But as a matter of marketing, you should be clear that continued
     problems with space and heat will lead to lower attendence
     in the future.

Whatever they do, they have to get some bigger rooms, or better anticiapte which

Oregon Convention Center would be convenient for me, but it lacks the large

This is for sure.  The word everywhere is that O'Reilly got a better deal
if they signed up for two years at one location.  Sub-word is that they
have signed on for another one after that, but the O'Reilly folks I talked
to could only give the nod to next year.

I think that's being called within mutt on a single message.

This is explained in the manual:

| sa-learn [options] --file message
|
| sa-learn [options] --mbox mailbox
|
| sa-learn [options] --dir directory

In this case --mbox sounds right.

Yah, I've been keeping track. But I didn't know there was a competition.

In addition to reporting to Razor2, I bounce /all/ spam to uce at ftc.gov. Here
are a couple of tips for `mutt` users.

To easily identify if a spam has already been logged by RAZOR2, in your
.muttrc do:


color index yellow	black    '~h "RAZOR2_CHECK"'


This allows me easily bypass reporting to Razor mail in my spam folder
that's already logged by them.

To facilitate bouncing just the email (without the SA stuff) to uce at ftc.gov
(and then deleting the spam), I use this macro in .muttrc:


macro index ,u <view-attachments>2<enter><bounce-message>uce at ftc.gov<enter>yqd


This works for newer versions of SA that support tagging as a message/rfc822
MIME part.

The Convention Center is designed more for "big main floor" events.
That's clearly not OSCON.  Most technical computer conventions fare
better at Hotel Centers.

  I've attended a number of events there, both before the expansion and
since then. There are smaller rooms (but larger than what hotels have
available) downstairs in the original part and upstairs in the new part.
Very nice facilities, accessible by public transportation and probably quite
suited to OSCON.

What about hotels/restaurants nearby?  People may be willing to pay $2.50/day
to go to/from their hotel, but I don't remember there being lots of restaurants
within walking distance of the convention center.

Sometime in the past year or so, fareless square was extended to include
MAX as far as the Lloyd Center stop.

Actually, there are several over by Lloyd Center (especially to the north
on Weidler) which is walkable.  There is no 'fairless square' over there,
though, like there is downtown.  I took a group of Rubyists up to the
Rogue Pub (which would have been a very long walk) by walking
up to PSU and jumping on the streetcar.  It was a free ride since we
stayed within the fairless square.

Perhaps they could have partitioned the rooms in the Marriot a bit better.
Our Ruby talks were packed (SRO and people standing out in the hall trying
to listen in) - we really could have used a bigger room.  Some of
those very long rooms (created from partitioning the Oregon Ballroom) were
only 1/3 to 1/4 full for some talks.  I don't know if those could be
further divided in half or not - they'd have to have an access door on the
other side.   As others have noted, however, in some cases it's difficult
to predict which talks will attract a crowd and what size that crowd will
be.

I'm hoping that they let Matz do a 'State of the Gem' talk next
year ;-)

Actually, Tri-Met extended fareless square to include Lloyd center 
earlier this year or late last year. The MAX is free from I-405 to Lloyd 
Center.

This brings up a good point.  I think PLUG and other Local groups did
not do a good enough job at "welcoming" the masses to Portland. 
Randall's event was ultra-cool, but there should be more.  Portland is a
friendly high tech city, but how many attendees learned that?

This is less a critisim than an observation.  I think if this con or any
other con is held here we should do some kind of event, we should do
something like "everyone meet at Bridgeport."  Less an expensive party,
but a destination for convention goers to target.

Colin,

  Tony Roma's is across the street. Slightly north, on the same west side of
MLK there's a Denny's and a few others. Perhaps a hotel restaurant, too.

Hi all,

I have a voice/fax modem setup with vgetty acting as an answering
machine.  This is working well enough, but I would like to be able to
log in to the box and turn call forwarding on and off.  Anyone have any
ideas about how this might be accomplished?  I would really like to be
able to create a script that would take the number to be forwarded to as
the argument (if no argument, forwarding would be disabled).

Thanks,

Message-ID: <20030715150132.Y5759@kudzuforest.com>

Okay, this is pretty bogus.  I was doing some work on my
sendmail config, and realized I never updated my version
to 8.12.9 after the big whooptie-do in late March.

I never bothered to set up any of the automated redhat
update tools; I usually just go to the RH Errata pages
and download what I need.

But this is perplexing.  I read the advisory RHSA-2003:120-07
which describes the sendmail vulnerability which exists in
all versions prior to and including 8.12.8.  Then it (the
advisory) provides links to the apporpriate updates.redhat.com
directory for each RH distribution verison.  For 7.3, the link
is sendmail-8.11.6-25.73.i386.rpm.  What?  8.11.6?  Does the
-25 mean it's been patched up the ying-yang to fix the 
vulnerability?  When I updated my RH9 system, I got
sendmail-8.12.8-5.90.i386.rpm.  This is still 8.12.8.  Why
doesn't RedHat built and distribut 8.12.9 like sendmail.org
urges everyone to do?

Ehh?  Am I missing something?

Yes. Try

  rpm -q --changelog -p sendmail-8.11.6-25.73.i386.rpm

for the highlights.

Redhat, in a effort to make updates easier (feature creep being what it 
is) will tend to backport fixes to earlier versions of applications.

Why not just bundle 8.12.9?  It seems so easy...

Some sysadmins have very strict rules about updating from version to 
version. If they don't change the version number, then it's no problem. 
If the version number changes, then they have to go through lots of 
testing before they deploy on live servers.

Since Redhat is playing for the big corporate environment, that's the 
model they work towards.

Right, those things are where you say they are, but they're not exactly a
place where anybody who, say, has been in a major city in the past fifty
years would WANT to eat.

If you walk a pace, there's a strip of OK restaurants on Broadway starting
at about 11th and going up to 25th or so.  There are also a couple of OK
places down Grand & MLK, but nothing within several blocks of the
Convention Center itself.

There are also a bunch of cheap hotels, some equipped with crummy
restaurants.

Conventions are best suited to downtown areas.  That part of the east side
just isn't well-developed for people on foot.  It still suffers from the
I-5/84 onramps.  (Of course, this would all be fixed if we just moved all
the freeways out of the city completely and put them in outlying areas
where they belong.)

All,

I recently received an email from my ISP.

   We have received the following complaint about unsolicited emails being sent 
   from your ... or spam being sent advertising 
   a site at that address. Sending any form of unsolicited or bulk mail, or using 
   unsolicited email to promote a site hosted anywhere on our network is strictly

Yep, that sure is spam.  But as I dug into it I saw that the email was forwarded because I have
an alias for the user at the other ISP.  As in:

obc-fest:	address at othersystem.com

So  email sent to obc-fest at oregonbrewcrew.com is forwarded to the human that is handling volunteers
for this year's festival.  The address is listed on a OBC  web site form from where I assume a spam bot
scraped it.

I'm not the source of the SPAM. I'm not an open relay.  I am forwarding the spam.  
Do you think I'm violating my ISPs AUP?

There was a bridgeport event Monday night, casually scheduled as

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0307161031520.29934-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Something new here since I upgraded both VMware (to Workstation 4.0) and
my GPS mission planning/differential correction software. I can _send_ data
from the workstation to the field computer via /dev/ttyS0 (seen by VMware
and the win app as com1:) but I cannot _receive_ data from the field
computer on the workstation.

  I've tried changing the baud rate and both ports on my serial switch with
no success. The data for the planned job will download to the field computer
but the completed job data cannot be transferred back. One of the data files
(all of 1kb) does transfer, but the raw data do not.

  I'm totally puzzled by all this and cannot think of anything to try to get
it working in both directions once again. At the GPS manufacturer's (in
Corvallis) they had no problem downloading the data from the field computer.

Any ideas?

Subject: [PLUG] glibc 2.3.x breaking static linked binaries (rehdat9 has 2.3.2)
Message-ID: <1058380150.1412.46.camel@kat>

I just upgraded a box from Redhat 7.3 to redhat 9

It seems that glibc 2.3.2 breaks a bunch of static binaries.


Does anyone know of a solution to fix this (like a rogue -compat rpm). 
I have he following on my system:

compat-libstdc++-7.3-2.96.118
compat-libs-6.2-3
compat-slang-1.4.5-5
compat-pwdb-0.62-3

I see a few in red-carpet for gcc, but not glibc.

Anyone dealing with this?

-----------------

Here is the debugging I did:

For one of the binaries of them I was able to fake it by grabbing the
rpm for the glibc from 7.3:

rpm2cpio ~/public_html/rh7.3/RedHat/RPMS/glibc-2.2.5-34.i686.rpm | cpio -di

Then calling

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=pathtpoldglibc/lib filetorun

And it works.

But others appear more fragile.

Running strace this are the libs I see getting called:

This is from a statically linked game (netrek) before the PATH
statement:

open("/lib/libnss_files.so.2", O_RDONLY) = 5
open("/lib/tls/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY)    = 5
open("/lib/ld-linux.so.2", O_RDONLY)    = 5
open("/lib/libnss_nisplus.so.2", O_RDONLY) = 5
open("/lib/libnsl.so.1", O_RDONLY)      = 5

I can probably get a complete chroot environment to work, but it seems
to me this is a glibc issue.

In the past, there have been -compat packages to fix these issues.  In

This package contains the version 2.1.3 of the GNU C library for

Maybe there is a selection bias here.  Maybe the X^nL for large n
shirt seekers are more likely to never to leave the convention site
(and thus be more likely to visit your booth) than for smaller n.

And anyway, you don't need large participation for a hike to be fun
and a way for at least a few so-inclined visitors to get a taste for
the region.

Subject: [PLUG] Open office hangs on start - KDE, rh 8.0
Message-ID: <E19cVDQ-0008BF-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

I've got a Dell P3 laptop on which I'm running RH 8.0., and KDE. This
machine is a dedicated word processor - so aside from occasional use of the
web browser, I'm solely using Open Office Writer.

When I start  OpenOffice, usually by double clicking the icon on the
taskbar, the OpenOffice splash screen comes up, and about 50% of the time,
it hangs.

When I check the active processes, it doesn't even show OpenOffice running
as one of them.

The only solution so far, has been to logout of KDE and try again. Any
thoughts?

Thanks,

Greg

only way to tell would be for OSCON folks to have OCC run a match against 
available room "Series".  There are some nice features in OCC, but it ain't 
downtown, so the environ and culture is different.  I'd say give it a couple 
years.  Who knows, OSCON may have 20,000 attending by then.  :^)

In addition to that, the convention center is breathtakingly expensive.  I'm on 
the board of the 54th National Square Dance Convention, which will be at the 
OCC in June of 2005; the numbers are staggering.

(Bit of a shameless plug...)

I think smaller computer conventions can do quite well at the Oregon 
Convention Center. It's just a matter of picking the right rooms. We're 
holding the WebVisions 2003 event there on Friday, in Lobby 'B' and 
Meeting Room B113 - B116. I was just there with a couple of PTP members 
yesterday making a check for the wifi arrangements and was surprised at 
the amount of space we'll have, and very happy about the much higher 
ceilings than you get in a hotel cellar. :)

Here's the Plug: http://www.webvisionsevent.org  -> This Friday, 5+ 
speakers, and wrap party just $75. Something for everyone.

  This may not help, but I've had mornings when I log on, startx and find no
OO.o coming up. A look at the process list shows some old threads, a zombie
associated with each, that never were cleared out.

  Manual killing of the stuck processes fixes the situation.

Are you running spamassassin with the `-a' switch?

       -W, --add-to-whitelist
           Add all email addresses, in the headers and body of the mail
           message read from STDIN, to the automatic whitelist.  Note that
           you must be running "spamassas?sin" or "spamd" with the -a switch
           for this to work.

Hmmm...

I'm running a similar system (I'm on it right now) D845PEBT2
Motherboard... not the greatest... but it certainly does work... We
watched Treasure Island DVD on the Windows Partition last night... 

I can't seem to get the sound working decently under linux... and the
Radeon 9700 is still toying with me under linux... but other than that
it works fairly nicely... 

I'm using Cyberlink PowerDVD under Win XP... If you don't want the
system I'll buy it from you... for the said $500... 

Also you may want to check the power settings... it was a bear getting
the power to clean up nicely... I even had to replace one power
supply...

Let me know... or send me an E-Mail pietvw @ onlinemac.com

Subject: [PLUG] Problems with Intel D845PEBT2

Will EMU do an exchange?  This is a fairly new system, about $718 
worth of new stuff that I picked up recently being last month.  
I want to get rid of it because I can't get DVD playback to work 
under Linux or Windows, it seems to have a device routing problem, 
and the sound card which I didn't know it would have built into it
doesn't work properly under Windows 98 even with the patch applied.

I've gotten it to play through a DVD by disabling onboard sound and 
installing a SB Live but it still doesn't buffer properly.  I know 
putting a movie I tried on it into my brother's G4 to verify this 
fact.  It wasn't the scratches on the DVD unless my player is more
sensitive than his.

The system has a 2.4 Ghz processor, $199
The D845PEBT2 motherboard was $145
I think the memory, 512 megs of DDR, was $69
...the case is around $59.
And I bought an 80 Gig Hitachi with it as 
well.

Disabling the sound and replacing it may be ok for Linux but I guess 
on the Windows side the only possibility left is XP where I'm really 
not interested in throwing good money after bad.  Is the Soundman 
Cadenza integrated into this board supported under Linux yet?  
Does anyone have any clue on how to get DVD playback to work 
smoothly on this board under any OS?

Does anyone know how to sell stuff on E-Bay?  I figure I can sell this 
stuff for $500 and pay my parents back for the hard drive and
motherboard.
I'll just say that it isn't Linux compatible and that Windows 98 doesn't
very well on it unless you turn the onboard sound off and replace it.

There should be a warranty on these parts, maybe something's faulty.
I guess I need to look for the money order receipts.

     --  Michael C. Robinson

To whoever answered my question of what is 100% Linux compatible, 
assuming this board is, where can I get a driver for the onboard 
sound and will the 2.6 kernel for sure support the serial ATA 
controller?

Does anyone know if DVD's can be played under Linux on this board
or if XP can be installed stably to it?

Subject: [PLUG] UDP/ICMP packet loss question on RH
Message-ID: <p0521065cbb3bfb0505bc@loligo.com>

Forgive my ignorance if this is an obvious question, but I am not a 
hardcore Linux person, and so my experiences with the Linux TCP/IP 
stack are limited.  I am, however, quite fluent with UNIX network 
protocols and this is an issue that I have not been able to 
adequately Google-search due to the number of hits I get with the 
keywords.

I am trying to track down a problem with some VoIP RTP stream jitter 
and (perhaps) loss, and the first test I did was to see if a crude 
UDP packet loss test would pass.  My results were inconclusive.

My test was to send 100 UDP packets via the 'traceroute' program, and 
see how many came back.  Yes, I know that only half the trip is UDP 
and the other is ICMP, but I figured it would be a clue that I should 
dig more deeply in that direction.

Here is what I got (IP address and hostname changed to protect the guilty):

Note that roughly every sixth packet has been dropped.  "Very 
strange," I said, "but let's try that on some other hosts to see if 
it's consistent."  Indeed, every Linux Redhat 7.2 and Redhat 8.0 host 
I tested came back with the same symptoms, even between hosts on the 
same LAN (where, by the way, I am experiencing no problems with any 
VoIP RTP strangeness, even with the same codecs, so it's not a 
"problem".)

Now, I have been unable to answer my first question about VoIP 
badness (which I think may be software related elsewhere) but my 
investigation makes me wonder why something is dropping these 
packets, either inbound UDP or outbound ICMP.  No other OS I tested 
against showed the same symptoms.  Is this some kind of rate-limiting 
feature in Linux?  I know that IOS will not process more than a 
certain %age of packets that are ICMP outbound from the router 
itself; perhaps someone thought that was a good idea to include in 
the Linux TCP/IP stack.

(Don't harass me about the version of Redhat I'm running, or that I'm 
running Redhat.  I don't own these systems, I'm just the consultant.)

It's also very likely Much More Expensive than a hotel space, and a
nearby staging hotel would still be required to manage the convention.

A lot of the space in a hotel comes at a discount because a lot of
rooms are being booked in the same hotel.  The Expo Center needs no
such incentive.

Is this at the lilo prompt?

Then your disk geometry is off.

Try loading the Redhat 9 cd, type rescue at the prompt and follow the
instructions for running chroot.

If it does not find you installation the disk is foorbared.  Consider
reinstalling.

If you are running lilo (not grub) type 
  lilo -v (check for errors).
  exit
  reboot.
  pull the cd.
  

I am not sure how to do this with grub.

Things that could cause problems:

  The drive letter changed (hda to hdb). The Kernel image was whomped. 
The MBR was whomped.  The whole drive was eaten by gnomes (insert kde
joke here).

Keith,

  Does "peer-to-peer" have a more specific meaning in this context? All
networks can be considered peer-to-peer if you look at them from the right
angle.

  This is just more confirmation that when it comes to politics there's no
difference between R's, D's and all others.

  Thanks for the heads-up. Glad to see the EFF is on top of this.

Or perhaps you can't read? The amendment says "without authorization
from the copyright owner" on line 20. Does the GPL not specifically say
that you are authorized to make copies? Perhaps I'm just out of my
mind...

Either way, stop being so paranoid. While I definitely don't agree with
this law, it's not going to hurt open source.

Zot,

    I totally agree.  It would have been nice if PLUG could have gotten
together with someone to offer a party.  I thought about it, but didn't
have time to do anything.  Maybe next year ...  If next year happens.

    I recall one year when Linux Mall, LinuxFund, and the Los Vegas LUG
hosted a party for "invited geeks" during Comdex.  That was the best part
of Comdex and it only cost $500.  Best of all, the LUG didn't have to
pay a dime, but they managed to come up with some storage and
transportation for LinuxFund.  LinuxFund paid for the party from the
savings of not having to pay conference fees for warehousing their items.
It was a win-win situation.

                                          Sincerely,

Subject: [PLUG] Linux-friendly Laptops On EBay?
Message-ID: <20030717144410.5f7b7402.jason@vancleve.com>

Can anyone who shops EBay suggest a few good laptop models/series that I
might find there nowadays, so I know what to look for?  This would be a
Linux-friendly development machine with at least a 1.4 GHz processor. It
will need to run a database, apache, a servlet engine, a Web browser and
an IDE all at once, so it'll need plenty of RAM (though I can probably
buy that, depending on the cost of the computer, etc.)

I need a new laptop, but I've never bought a REAL one, nor ever run
Linux on one, so I could use a bit of guidance.  I'll need a WiFi card,
and DVD (and I don't want to have to install Winders).

Thanks a-plenty,

Here is the process to re-install grub:

Boot to a RH9 CD, "linux rescue" and follow prompts like Zot said. Once
logged in, chroot like so:

chroot /mnt/sysimage

Reinstall grub:

/sbin/grub-install /dev/hda

Not all Open Source Software is covered by the GPL and anyone can 
modify their copyright for their written works at anytime. This kind 
of legislation is absurd and that is all I am pointing out.

If you're running Red Hat 9, you'll have troubles because of the new

I'm sort of reading this and sort of staying out of the discussion, but:

    -  The Oregon Convention Center is far from perfect, but I
       think it is affordable.  It is worthly of consideration.

    -  How much conference space does the Jantzen Beach Double Tree have?
       I suppose the Holt Center is inconveniently located for O'Reilly
       (and PLUG).

 Give the accused a jury of office workers and doctors and you will 
get you a conviction of someone sending a email with a file attached 
using these type of laws. I doubt you will find more then a few 
judges that understand the Internet and network file sharing. Besides 
it only cost the targeted Internet user $50,000 or more to defend 
themselves of the charges under laws that are so vague conviction is 
easy. I imagine there are people you can point to that have been 
convicted using vague US or State computer laws. Anyone on this list 
want to share their experinces? 

  The hysteria surrounding the Internet, file sharing and other modes 
is reaching absurd levels. 
 Here is an example from a NY Times Article:

Internet Chat Seen as Tool to Teach Theft of Credit Cards
By NICHOLAS THOMPSON

On Tuesday morning, one Internet chat group called #ccpower was 
bustling. A user there was selling credit card numbers, obtained 
illegally online, for 50 cents to $1 each, another was accusing other 
sellers of stolen credit card numbers of cheating, and yet another 
user wanted lessons on cracking into online sites containing credit 
card information

One option is Dell Financial Services - they sell refurbished laptops on 
eBay, without an OS. Most of them are P3's, but I think you can get a 
better processor if you aren't in too much of a hurry. And DVD's are 
standard with a lot of them.

Actually, there are several reasonable (in the modern sense of the word,
which could also be read as "absurd" or "nightmarish") situations that
could arise where this would really hurt Free Software.

The one that springs immediately to mind involves this law becoming part
of Title 17 (the copyright section of US Code) and hence any failure to
respect DRM technologies built into "sharing" software would be considered
a violation of Sec. 1201 (the anti-circumvention section of the DMCA).

There are others, but I need lunch.

The only threading library issues I've had is with the latest rpm
version. You can use the LD thread thingerbob to get around it.

I had to tweak a couple of startup things in rc.sysinit and in
modprobe.conf because there is a new module naming scheme.  .ko 
and I upgraded a couple of packages.. 

<wink>
This could be helpful:

</wink>

I also had a problem with my touch pad on a Dell Latitude 640.. It
didn't work. And I'm not sure yet whether support is even in 2.6 yet.

Anyway..

If you intend to use power management please see the list of
laptops with incorrect DSDTs here:

These machines are out of spec and will not be supported by ACPI4Linux.

I caught a reference in passing to someone on the list who was hosting a party 
for the webconference.  If this party is using the Aura as its location, I am 
the security supervisor for that club ( and 4 others on that block). If you 
need anything (xtra security or amenities) either email me off list or any 
staff wearing a radio can contact me on premises after 9pm.  We have another 
venue on the block that is open until 4am I probably could work a cut  or 
non-existent cover at that venue after the Aura is closed if you are 
interested.  Will do what I can to take care of list members.

Subject: [PLUG] Covad DSL?
Message-ID: <20030717182819.5bc70b98.list@sonofhans.net>

Folks ~

Has anyone had any experience with Covad's DSL service in Portland? 
Ideally, can you compare them with your QWest experiences?

I may be able to get Covad DSL, at nearly three times my current
speed, for just a smidge more than I pay QWest (thanks to Wil for
pointing this out).  I've used QWest since the service became
available, and it's been very, very stable.  I'm not actively looking
to leave them, but Covad's deal sounds good.

My priorities are a stable line at the advertised speed, and
responsive tech support if the line's ever down.  I don't know what
QWest's support is like because I call my ISP Hevanet (who are
fantastic BTW) in the rare case of problems.

TIA,

Randall

I have Covad DSL, through Speakeasy. I don't deal directly with Covad,
Speakeasy does. Once I needed a repairman to come to my home, he was from
Covad, but again Speakeasy sent him. He did a good job. Beyond that, the
Covad part of my setup is pretty much invisible. Sure, they own the DSL
equipment in call offices and what not, and all that stuff just works.

Never had Qwest DSL.  I've had Covad DSL since late 1999.

There has been one ATM outage in that time and that was in Covad's
longhaul bit from here to Seattle.  My ISP is Speakeasy and they were
routing everyone in Portland through the Seattle POP for the first year or
two.  Since they moved to a Portland POP, it's been rock stable.  (I've
had IP issues, but they're not related to the DSL.)

I've even had Qwest totally remove my dial-tone service in error and the
DSL stayed up (though I was getting 100% packet loss for 14 seconds every
44 seconds, which I can't figure out but must have been related to a test
signal or something on my phone line during the repairs).

I get pretty good speed.  A sustained downstream of 160KB is reliable.  My
upstream sometimes has pretty high latency.  I've not investigated that
too deeply.

I'd be interested to know (1) what Covad charges, and (2) what connection
speed they provide. It sounds like those who responded that they use Covad
are /not/ using them for their ISP. Judging from Covad's web site, that
would make them way more expensive than my current DSL provider (Verizon).
Their TeleSurfer PLUS DSL is $49.95/mo. - around $14 more than I'm currently
paying for the same speed (but I get a static IP). I don't want to drop
Aracnet. I /am/ interested in upgrading to 1.5Mbps/384Kbps, but I'm
grandfathered into a sweet deal for 1.5/128 and it would cost me another
$10/mo. to upgrade (not counting Aracnet's increase). But Covad appears to
charge $69.95 for 1.5/384 - such a deal. So... what's the deal?

Not used but I shopped around recently for a laptop that had similiar specs 
(mine included 1400x1050 screen resolution) and finally settled on the ze5165 
for about $1300 at bestbuy.  A little heavy but very capable.

That's the price that I saw.  My current DSL is ~$35 for Qwest and $17
for DSL-Only, which isn't much less than the Covad price at 2.5x the
downstream speed and 1.5x the upstream, plus it comes with 5 instead of
1 IP address.  Plus it's a "business" account, so (in theory, at least)
repair service should be quicker (but I haven't had any problems with
the current set up in the 2+ years I've had.

You should be aware that Covad is regarded as a spam-friendly provider, and is 
on many DNSBLs, and even worse, on many private blocklists. This might cause 
some problems sending email, or running a mail server. See this NANAE article 
as a starting point-

All,

I have been experiencing FTP problems since Comcast took over ATT Broadband.
The issue is that when I try to FTP files from work to home I get the
following error:
Netout:  connection reset by peer
I never had this problem until just recently.
Does anyone have any ideas here???
I have tried various options for FTP with no success.

Are you using passive ftp? I've found that it helps.

Subject: [PLUG] Spam Filtering With Remote Access
Message-ID: <1058546736.8979.37.camel@sparticus>

All,

The Goal: build a server that will effectively filter spam, deliver
email, and provide convenient remote access to corporate data. The
server may or may not be behind a firewall, so security is of primary
importance.

Of course, to avoid vendor lock-in and restrictive licensing contracts
while at the same time increase security and reliability, the server
should run Open Source software.

The Solution:

  Postfix + Spamassassin + UW IMAP + Samba + Apache Web Server +
SquirrelMail

This configuration allows business travelers and office workers alike
the ability to access their email and server file shares from anywhere
on the Internet, including their homes. Please refer to the following
links:

  http://www.mwvlug.org/imap/imap_email_client.jpg

  http://www.mwvlug.org/imap/web_mail.jpg

Also, spam filtering is not obvious but definitely "commandable." For
details, please see the following:

  http://www.mwvlug.org/spam_filtering/index.html

And yes, Dr. Shepard, I did take the photo in the first screen capture
:-)

The first image depicts my email client connected to my IMAP server
using SpamAssassin. Now, while the 'images' directory is a sub-folder
under my home directory, there is absolutely no reason why this could
not be a Samba share pointing to a remote Linux or NT server. This means
in effect that business travelers can access their email and files
centrally through their email client. Doing so negates the need for a
VPN within the scope of these accesses. The user need know only how to
set their account up through their email client. Security is handled via
Secure Socket Layer (SSL). This is helpful during those panicked 2 a.m.
phone calls from Sales associates who had inadvertently wiped out their
Sales presentation documents.

The second screen image shows the same email box through the browser.
Note the folders on the left hand side: these to point to directories on
the server. "Subscribing" to sub-folders gives you the server shares I
described above. You can actually have both clients open and watch as
you delete an email from the browser side and see the mail get deleted
on the Evolution email client.

Unfortunately, the UW IMAP server requires a user account on the Linux
server to access their email through IMAP. This can be mitigated
somewhat through automated synchronization with the Linux or Exchange
email server.

While totally conjecture at this point, I see no reason why the web
server and the mail server need be on the same computer. Also, adding
MySQL (also housed on a separate server if need be) to the mix make for
high performance mail stores.

What you get then is an email system that lets you manipulate your
server files (add, remove, edit, view, play movies, etc.) just as you
would through the "Network Neighborhood" while providing effective
Bayesion spam filtering and web access. 

I can build install, and document these and other servers at your
facility if you are interested.


Best,

On a Linux box? Of course!  Graphical ftp client or command line tool?  
I've seen when using gftp to some sites that it fails part way through the
download but if I 'ftp' from the command line I get the file(s).
  If you're not using a Linux box there used to be some issues (and
probably still are) with MS' tcp/ip stack that caused failures but more
often around 3 MByte.

Does COMCAST do PPPoE?  Does PPPoE require/use MTU settings. (Never had to
deal with it.)  MTUs: Bigger is faster (less timeouts), smaller is slower
but the rest of the connection activities are more responsive.

Or I could be out to lunch.

Right, but Cyrus's IMAP server, while very fast and scalable, does not
(to the best of my knowledge) allow an administrator to mount Samba
shares under it's IMAP namespace. Don't get me wrong, I love Cyrus but
it employs it's own indexing, making it a "black box" for server shares.
If you know a way to do this, I am all ears as I found Cyrus's IMAP
server very reliable and fast.

Love Amavisd for virus scanning to protect Windows clients. Does Amavisd
let you call SpamAssassin during the MTA phase?

  Is it only me or are others getting a slow but steady feed of blank

  Every day or two I'll get 1 to several messages that I would normally
dismiss as Klez virii except these have no attachments. Just a header with
no body (perhaps sent from "The Adams Family"?). They appear to be randomly
generated by some malware.

  Anyone know the story behind these? And, has anyone worked out a postfix
filter (header_check or body_check) to reject all messages without body
content?

I wasn't even aware that Covad provided IP service.  Mine comes from

I can not down load large files (100 to 700 meg) with out this same 
error on either linux or windows. 
My internet connection has become very flake since comcast has taken 
over :-(  
If I call them them make me take off the fire wall and only connect to a 
windows box so they can do
there think.  Then I put it all back and it works fine for about 2 
weeks.  It has been a real pain in
the butt :-(
I have told several people to go with another vender (DSL) if they can.

Subject: [PLUG] VMware serial port help needed
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0307181003530.7314@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I have a problem transmitting data from my field computer to the desktop
software running under the virtual win98. I've posted on the VMware
newsgroups and elicited no responses in three days. The company won't help
unless I fork over big bucks. I know there are VMware users here and I'd
appreciate your collective intelligence in solving this problem.

  Background: I've use VMware to host my Microsoft-only GPS software since
1998. Over this period I've had no problems downloading feature files and
job settings from the desktop to the field computer nor uploading the
collected data from the field computer to the desktop.

  A couple of months ago I upgraded both the GPS desktop/field software and
VMware (to catch the lowest costs, not because new "features" are needed
now). A couple of weeks ago I had some data collection to do so I charged up
all the batteries, let the system sit on a table in the backyard collecting
the latest satellite ephemeris data in its almanac and uploaded the almanac
from the field computer to the desktop. I also created the feature file for
the project and downloaded that from the desktop to the field computer. All
of these transfers are from the virtual win98's com1: (/dev/ttyS0) at 38.4
kbps. Same protocol I've used for five years.

  When I returned with the data in the field computer I hooked up the cable
and tried to upload to the desktop. There are three files: a *.def of 1K, a
*.raw that contains the data and was in the 10Kb range (only a dozen or so
points), and the alm.mnx almanac file. The .def file transfers both
automatically and manually, but the .raw file just will not pass.

  A call to the GPS manufacturer (in Corvallis) lead to the techie's working
with me, with the same results: no data transfer. A few days later I drove
the field computer to Corvallis and left it. They had no problems getting
the files off and e-mailing them to me. Then they sent back the field
computer.

  I've tried again to copy off the files and they just won't go. I have
another project this coming week and I would like to get the two-way data
transfer running again before then. But, I've no idea where to start
looking: VMware-4.0 or the GPS software. I suppose I can re-install the
latter and see if that helps.

  But, another problem which may or may not be related is that while I have
no problems printing maps from my other windoze application to the color
printer, it will no longer send output to the laser printer. I get a message
from the virtual win98 that the printer is not connected. Again, this is a
brand new problem.

  I'd really appreciate some help on resolving these two issues. After five
years of no problems using the same software, it's rather frustrating to
upgrade two of the four pieces involved (i.e., VMware, win98, GPS software,
GIS software) and have essential communications components break.

This is basically setup I use in my Mail Defender package: 
http://nakedape.cc/r/maildefender, except that I use Sophos Anti-Virus
and Sophie, a daemonized scanner, and amavisd-new.  You should also of
course include any extra scanners that SpamAssassin can use, like Razor2
and DCC.

You really don't want to use a network file system for mail storage,
either for your MTA's spool or the client retrieval server.  If remote
access is the purpose, you're much better off doing it the standard way
with POP/IMAP/SMTP over SSL.  If scalability is the issue, the "Murder"
component of Cyrus let's you transparently proxy to the appropriate
host, letting you spread the load over multiple servers.  OTOH, I see no
technical reason you couldn't put the IMAP spool on a network file
server and mount it--you just have to live with the potential loss of
mail due to the way network file systems work.

amavisd-new does.  It's a fork from the original amavisd which includes
SpamAssassin scanning and has a number of other features no found in the
original.  It's also be more actively developed. 
http://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/  The only downside is the
hokey-sounding name.

I've never done an installation that large (though I'd love to), but I
know there are some.  I know Eric Harrison et al at MESD uses Cyrus, and
I'd guess they're approaching that scale.

Good point. Alternatively, you may simply use IP tables to do this.

I am sorry, but this is not correct. The clients accessing the share
through IMAP. I have a server like this running that allows only IMAP,
SMTP, and HTTP through. Everything happens through port 143.

For added security, install a second NIC pointing to the Intranet and
route the SMB traffic. 

Also please note that all communications are handled via Secure Socket
Layer (SSL).

For full blown access, VPN is unquestionably the best way to go. For
small and medium sized business travelers who need to be nimble and for
employees who want a convenient way to access documents from home, I
recommend this approach.

Right. I simply will configure "plain text" communication for my
customers. It's a simple thing to just check the SSL box during the
client's setup.

Best,

So wait--let me understand this.  You're using UW-IMAP to access the
/files/ in your home directory?  And UW-IMAP lets you do that even if
they're not recognized mbox files?  Hmm....

John, I ran into the same thing during my test with Cyrus. The problem
was how to call Procmail from Postfix for destination to Cyrus IMAP. I'm
not certain that this is what you ran into but if so here's the way to
make Postfix call your procmail recepies and then deliver to the Cyrus
IMAP store:

In /etc/postfix/main.cf modify your mailbox_transport parameter to this:

  mailbox_transport = cyrus_procmail

The cyrus_procmail definition is one you will create in
/etc/postfix/main.cf.

Back up your modification in main.cf with this added line in 
/etc/postfix/master.cf:

  cyrus_procmail  unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
  flags=R user=cyrus argv=/usr/bin/procmail -m /etc/procmailrc ${user}

This calls procmail in "general purpose" mode and will pass the 'user'
argument to /etc/procmailrc... a parameter that as I understand it is
usually lost.

Finally, simply add the following to your /etc/procmailrc file as best
suits your needs:

###########################################################
### Deliver it to the user inbox
###########################################################
                                                                                
 :0
 | /usr/cyrus/bin/deliver -a $1 -m user.$1


That's it, happy people!

That's just... bizarre.  I don't know if that's brilliant or horribly,
horribly hackish.  But I can't think of too many better ways to do it.  

Were this not a Java servlet and probably terribly difficult to setup
(at least, to someone who's never set them up), this might be better:
http://davenport.sourceforge.net/

Or these for web-access to SMB:
http://www.dragonsdawn.net/~gordon/smb-network/
http://phpsamba.sourceforge.net/

Or this for SFTP:
http://j-ftp.sourceforge.net/

We are running Cyrus at PEAK. 

It does some things nicely.

However, it has broken all of the procmail and .forward 
based mail filtering. And so has broken many people.


I have chosen to take spam instead of moving to cyrus personally
because I process on the order of 4000 messages a day. And
with Cyrus breaking all the tools that I currently use, I would
not be able to function.

Cyrus uses a specific structure for message storage. And
as such, samba would not work underneath it.

Iptables is the interface that configures netfilter, which is the
firewalling code in the 2.4 kernels.  No netfilter, no iptables.

What is not correct?
Are you refuting that accessing a samba share across the internet is
insecure?  Or are you saying my interpretation of your setup is not
correct.  You had said the system may be one system and it may not have
a firewall.  Logic leads us to believe that samba would be on a machine
plugged directly in to the internet.  Without a firewall, this is not
secure.  Without a firewall, how can you require all communications to
occur through port 143?

Also port 143 is for imap without ssl, which means plain text passwords
having access to not only an imap server but also a file server through
imap and is even less secure with greater liability than using samba.

Without another firewall, the server itself should be the firewall by
compiling in netfilter.  Netfilter should be here in order to block
ports that are not allowed open, even if the daemon needs to be running.

Accessing a samba share across the internet is not secure.  Since you
mention it may not be behind a firewall, this means samba is available
to the internet.  Bad idea.  This is because LM and NTLM are not secure.
The former is easily crackable and both are replayable.  I would not
implement this over the public internet if I were you.  NTLMv2 which
uses 128bit encryption and negotiated keys should be required and all
lesser protocols refused.  This means specially configuring each win9x
client to support ntlmv2 (installing new patches) and configuring nt/2k
clients to only send ntlmv2 and configuring samba to use only ntlmv2.
However Samba 2.2.8a does not support it yet!  Therefore you cannot do
this securely.

If you want remote clients to access samba remotely then freeswan
should be compiled into the kernel as well and each client should have
an ipsec client.  These come with windows 2000, but for home cable users
a linksys that supports ipsec is excellent.  Also accessing windows
shares across 256kb or less is too slow to be practical.  Remote access
like vnc is much better for accessing browesable windows shares.

Next netfilter is used in conjunction with the vpn so that only packets
authenticated by ipsec are allowed to samba services.  Otherwise it
is perhaps just a mail/imap/web server.

This is true, relying on imap/ssl could provide secure remote access
without a vpn, however only with imap minus ssl disabled.

No longer is it conjecture, I've done it.  It is not necessary for them
to be the same machine with the applications you have suggested.  In
fact nearly all of the applications can reliably be on separate servers
with the exception of apache+squirrelmail and postfix+imapd.  The rest
of it looks good.

We're accomplishing the same with a slightly different setup:

postfix + amavisd + spamassasin + clamav + cyrus imapd

Right now we have 2 forward facing mail relays that handle email for
most all of campus.  These relays run amavisd which is sort of a
container for all of these tools like spamassasin and clamav.  It allows
you to quickly and easily modify your filtering tools without having to
muck with Postfix.

This summer we're switching to using lmtp to deliver to a Cyrus IMAP
store for all 35,000 ONID accounts.  I'm just as curious as all of you
are on how that is going to work ... :-)

I object to the use of "simply" and "iptables" in the same sentence. (-:

Cory has demonstrated for EUGLUG that he can plug his laptop into an
arbitrary Ethernet port and automatically bring up a VPN to his work
site.  It's very slick.

Of course, Cory's laptop runs Linux, so that give him a slight
advantage. (-:

Your interpretation of my setup is not correct. I mean, how does one do
SMB communications through the mail client? That's a dialog box I
haven't seen yet :-). It's through IMAP. Trust me.

No, it's a smbmount pointing to an NT server on the Linux box. The files
themselves are on another machin on the internal subnet. See to my
comment about adding a second NIC with routing to be doubly secure.

Reject the traffic with IP tables. Better to have a firewall.

Pardon me. IMAPS, port 993. My mistake.

True, it isn't as powerful as procmail, but I'be coped by doing my own
filtering (by list or sender) with Sieve and using
amavisd-new+SpamAssassin to filter for spam, which works fine.  But I
can completely understand the disadvantages if you have power users who
are accustomed to procmail and demand it.  Fortunately, in most of my
installations, I don't.

There has been some talk on the info-cyrus list about making the Sieve
components into loadable modules, which would open it more flexibility,
but I wouldn't hold my breath.

If my interpretation is not correct, then you should change your ad to
reflect a more accurate image.  This is what I saw in your initial email:

You mention "the server" and "a server" and "Samba" which is the server
component of the cifs/smb protocol on unix systems.

Adding another nic and routing doesn't do anything to give one added
security, it merely adds in another hop.  Correct logic rules in 
packet filtering does.

Netfilter+iptables _is_ a firewall and a very good one, _if_ configured
properly.

We are thinking of replacing our old Nokia Checkpoint firewall with
something new, as it seems to have problems with VPN for non-Windows
machines, as well as some other limitations, and a horrible user
interface.

I've heard good things about Sonicwall, but I'm also considering using
the open source IPCop. Would it be wise to use IPCop in a business
setting (50+ employees)? Is it capable of everything a new Sonicwall
firewall can do? Is it as secure?

You might also look at the SnapGear firewalls I sell:

They're nice little units and they're an embedded Linux system.

Could you elaborate? qmail is an MTA, how does one replace it with procmail?

Carla brings up a very good point. If I see lots of spam
coming from a certain ARIN netblock, I contact the owner
of the netblock and ask them for the IP address ranges
of their spammer customers so I can block those rangers.
If the netblock owner refuses to cooperate, as many of
them do (rackspace.com), I blacklist the entire netblock.
I don't care if it is a /16.

Seems like it would be easier to keep a list of IP addresses that you
want to receive mail from, then let the firewall drop everyone else. 
Then if anyone in the company sends an email to a new IP address, they
just tell you and you add it to the list.

At least this way you would be able to communicate with legitimate
businesses (with properly configured servers) that happen to use
rackspace.com as their host.

I'm against blocking email by IP address, the availability of legitimate
email suffers too much with this kind of filtering.

Message-ID: <1058571091.11969.689.camel@red>

I have a need for occasional color printing, such
a title pages on reports and pages with multi-color
graphics. I'm thinking that a low-cost ink jet printer
is adequate. I'd like to know which of the Linux-
compatible color printers people here like best. My
requirements are modest:

8.5 X 11 inch only
size of input tray is unimportant
Interface can be printer port or USB
I don't need to print photographs, envelopes, etc.

Just so there's no misunderstand, I've done the
research to find out what color printers are
compatible with Linux. I don't want to be reprimanded
for being lazy as has happened in the past here.

That's exactly what I do. We maintain a white list so
we can still communicate with people who are within the
black listed netblock.

I assume that you don't really mean this. You already stated
that the firewall should block mail from all IP addresses not
on the white list.

I went with an HP photosmart 1115, mainly because it is one of the few
that gets a print head change with the ink cartridge.  I think this is
the same print engine as the inkjet 650, the smart part comes from
having a memory card reader built in, handy for printing from the
camera.

The drivers aren't perfect, but I'm very happy with it so far.

It's not low-cost, but I've been happy with the HP 2250 Business Inkjet
printer.  I really like the built-in PostScript interpreter and the thing
is durable-- unlike my Canon BJC-6000.

It works with kprinter/CUPS without a hitch.

Actually, he said it would be easier for YOU to maintain whitelists, not
that he would like to do that himself.

That'll teach you to upgrade, eh?  I'm still using VMware 2.0 since, well,
it works.  ;-)

I would suggest backing out the VMware upgrade and see if the problem
persists.  Unless you can isolate the problem to either VMware or the GPS
software, it will be very hard to figure out what is going on.

Another option would be to install the old VMware, install another copy of
Win98 and see if that works with the old version of the GPS software.  If
so, make a backup then upgrade VMware only and see what happens.

If you can't find your VMWare software, you may be able to get one of
these downloads to work:

http://www.vmware.com/download/download_archive_2x.html
http://www.vmware.com/download/download_archive_3x.html
http://smokeping.planetmirror.com/pub/vmware/software/

Truly ancient versions of VMWare (2.x) will need these binary patches to
work on modern Linux kernels:

ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/vmware

Look for the most recent set.

Good luck!

I'm trying to mount an existing fat32 drive so that everybody on the

I'm mounting it 
# mount -t vfat -rw /dev/hdb1 /mnt/hdb

It mounts fine, but I cannot change user, group or permissions on it. Is
this because it's fat32? I googled the problem and found this;

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/archive/1/2002/12/3/38188

The main crux is his fstab line which looks like this: (once modified to
work for me)

/dev/hdb1 /mnt/hdb vfat
exec,dev,suid,rw,conv=auto,uid=502,gid=502,umask=000 0 0

Does this look okay?

Well, I don't know if he said/meant that. We'll have to

FAT32 has no concept of users or permissions, so all the files on the
filesysem will have these determined at mount time, and any attempt to
change them will fail.

Hopefully the software trying to do the change will react in a sane
manner.

Why would you assume a contradiction where there is a perfectly rational

I think this guy is looking for an MTA. :)

That said, Jeremy Deininger pointed out a tool called Lazydog. Lazydog, it
appears, is a script that helps you install and configure qmail. Here's

OK, here's the earliest copy of the message exchange
that I have on hand (I already deleted the Derek's
original response because I didn't know there would
be a postmortem):

That's exactly what I do. We maintain a white list so
we can still communicate with people who are within the
black listed netblock.

I assume that you don't really mean this. You already stated
that the firewall should block mail from all IP addresses not
on the white list.
---

You then replied:

---
Actually, he said it would be easier for YOU to maintain whitelists, not
that he would like to do that himself.
---

I don't think Derek was talking about my workload versus his
workload and there are no words in the message to indicate that.
I think he was talking about the wisdom of ANYONE blocking email
by large IP address ranges. But I don't have any idea whether he
really meant that because I'm not Derek. I also know that you're
not Derek.

The best solution would be for Derek to respond, but he's
probably wondering why this silly exchange has gone as far as it
has - as I am. This is a tough list to be on. Lots of nits to be
picked at and I guess I started it by telling Derek that he didn't
mean what he said. I'll try not to do that again.

The list doesn't need this semantic bickering, I know.  But this sort of
thing is important so I'll post this one and take the rest off-list.

There isn't?  How about this [emphasis mine]:

"Seems like it would be easier to keep a list of IP addresses that YOU
want to receive mail from, then let the firewall drop everyone else.
Then if anyone in the company sends an email to a new IP address, they
just tell YOU and YOU add it to the list."

He is telling you what would be easier for YOU to do.  Even if you
interpret that to be "a person" and not YOU specifically, it still doesn't
mean ME or I.

> I think he was talking about the wisdom of ANYONE blocking email by

Granted, he might have been talking about how ANYONE could block large IP
address ranges if they wanted to do it efficiently, but that HE wouldn't
do it himself.

> But I don't have any idea whether he really meant that because I'm not
> Derek. I also know that you're not Derek.

It's just a matter of giving a person the benefit of the doubt and not
assuming contradiction when there is another possibility.  It's courtesy
and respect and trust.

That could be for the best.

I was hoping to spark a conversation about why anyone would block huge
ip blocks, I'm sorry that my stupid sense of humor got in the way (I
think that original statement was supposed to be sarcasm).  It is not
easy being humor impaired.

I've had problems with a client trying to do business with Chinese
companies, and a large part of the problem was the "I'm going to block
all Asian addresses" syndrome.

I sincerely apologize to the list.

How is that a problem for your client? If he is using public DNSBLs, such as 
SPEWS or Spamcop.bl, then yes, China, Brazil, Russia, and other large gobs of 
netspace will not get to his inbox. But that's under his control. Or do you 
think, as so many people do, that DNSRBLs have magic powers to control the 
Internet? Individual admins choose to use them. 

 Why would anyone block huge ip blocks? Of the thousands of messages I've ever 
received from China, for one example, not one was a legitimate message. All 
spam. Most of them not even in English. Same for Brazil. All spam. Much 
easier to block it than to wade through it. I've yet to have anyone answer 
the question "Where is required that I must accept traffic from you, or from 
anyone?" When caught in a shit blizzard, wise people put up a big sturdy 
umbrella.

One of the most-frequently asked questions is "Why list ip blocks? why not 
just block spammers?" Two reasons: 1. Life is too short to play whack-a-mole 
with spammers shifting IP ranges and DNS. 2. I won't support a spam-friendly 
ISP. There's plenty of service providers who run good clean shops. That's who 
gets my support.

Thank the spammers for ruining one of the greatest innovations of all time. 
Don't blame the people who take strong measures to protect their systems.

And regardless of a person's personal beliefs about spam and blocklists, the 
reality is they exist, and need to be taken into account when selecting a 
service provider, or you could be nastily surprised. A good starting point is 
Google Groups, search both news.admin.net-abuse.sightings and 
news.admin.net-abuse.email.

Has anyone else tried OpenGroupware.org yet?  I've re-built RPMs from a
guy at Red Hat for 7.3 and the setup after doing that was pretty
quick--probably only about an hour.  It looks pretty nice and there's a
lot of talk about a forthcoming Evolution plug-in.

How do I justify inline-quoted text under Vim? For example,
I'm replying to an email with a paragraph like this:

Under pine/pico, I used to do this using the "C-j" or justify command.
The 'gq}' command works under Vim for regular paragraphs, but not for 
these when the quotes should be preserved. Any ideas?

Pipe it through fmt with the appropriate option.  Here's the lines from
my .vimrc:

" E-mail quoted text paragraph wrapping
map _k j{!}fmt -p"> "<cr>}

Has anyone gotten the Perl Text::AutoFormat module to actually work?  At
one point, someone (Paul H. I think) recommended it as the best filter,
but I built it and for the life of me cannot get it to do anything.

Was it Paul?  I remember someone on here had a very slick (seeming) mail
formatting option for vim that interested me quite a bit, but I was so far
from a working muttrc for all the things I like to do with email that I
just put it on the back burner.

Well, now I'm much closer to using mutt full time and I'm hoping to see
that again.

If anyone knows whereabouts to find that message or has any really good
tips, I'd like to see them.

Of course, the smarter the format the better.  Ideally I'd like to handle
regular quotes and nested quotes (naturally) and also attributed quotes
such as the common gnus:

This sounds like a dhcp lease issue.  Have you check your dhcp client?  Is it 
requesting a new lease?  What is the lease time?

Here's my .exrc mapping:

  map F !G perl -MText::Autoformat -e 'autoformat{ all=>1 }'

I occasionally still use it on gnarly stuff.

I see no reason for YOU to apologize. I welcome
discussion of spam-fighting techniques. It's a
serious problem with imperfect solutions. I guess
I should apologize since I'm the one who got
caught by the list police.

Umm, gq} works for me.  '>' is one of the default comment
characters, and vim knows how to fill comments.

    :set comments? formatoptions?
      comments=s1:/*,mb:*,ex:*/,://,b:#,:%,:XCOMM,n:>,fb:-
      formatoptions=tcq

Oh, I guess this isn't the default if 'set compatible' is on.
When 'compatible' is on, the default for formatoptions is 'vt',
which doesn't include comment formatting.

Spam aside, there's a basic belief about the Internet that
most people on the net have - that the Internet SHOULD
allow anyone on the net to communicate with anyone else -
that insulating yourself from a segment of the net
population is wrong. Perhaps this larger issue should be
discussed before we declared spam-fighting strategies as
right or wrong.

Oops, yes I was testing it with a different vimrc with vi compatiblity, but since 
I prefer the nocompatible mode this should work nicely.

Subject: [PLUG] (Semi-OT:) Linksys router messes up my LAN
Message-ID: <20030719121935.L70313@grond.sourballs.org>

A few weeks ago, I got a Linksys wireless router.  This router acts as the
gateway/firewall between the internet and our home LAN.  It's a pretty
crude firewall, and not nearly as configurable as what I used to have - a
Linux box running floppyfw - but that's not the problem here.

Everything seemed OK at first, but then I noticed that getting large
(10MB+) files to download didn't work very well.  Transfers would progress
for about 5 - 10 MB and then hang, indefinitely. The amount downloaded
varied, but would always crap out at about the same point for a given
file.  Attempting to re-download gets either the same result, or an even
smaller amount downloaded, or simply no connection at all.

At first I thought that FTP wasn't configured right, but then I noticed
that the problems occurred with large http transfers as well, and also
with just about any network activity that couldn't be completed in 10
seconds or so.  So lots of little files (like web browsing) works OK, but
downloading kernel source invariably fails.  This behavior was the same on
the 3 machines in the LAN - FreeBSD 4.6, SuSE 8.2, W2K.

At first I thought it was the cableco.'s fault - but they had me connect
the W2K machine (UNIX? We don't support no stinkin' UNIX) directly to the
cable modem, without the router, and downloads worked fine.

As a further test, I tried ftp'ing one of the big files I downloaded from
the W2K box to the FreeBSD box.  The transfer hung, just as it did across
the internet.  I took the two machines off the network and connected them
to each other with a hub, and the transfer worked fine.

Linksys tech.support has had me do a firmware upgrade, reset the router's
MTU to 1492, and reset the MTU on the local machines' NICs to 1492.  It
seems to have helped the W2K machine, but doesn't seem to have done much
for the other two, which I use and need a lot more.  I'll call Linksys
back soon after I do some more poking around, but does anyone have ideas
as to what might be causing this?

Did you have any firewall rules that accept DHCP packets from different 
DHCP servers possibly? I don't know if the switch from ATTBI to Comast 
made any changes in that different DHCP server are used and perhaps 
your firewall is blocking DHCP packets?. 

I know I did this with my Linux firewall when I ran one and so sometimes 
when my firewall's DHCP lease was renewed the packet would come from a 
different DHCP server. If the server wasn't listed in my firewall rules 
packets coming from it would be dropped. 

I don't use Linux for my firewall anymore and the DHCP client I use 
seems to be able to get around my firewall rules even if I see that the 
packet was blocked by the packet filter.

file and printer sharing. Problem may be that it is a laptop that
commutes between home and a school where it is part of a domain. I'm so
unfamiliar with windows now that I don't where to begin. 
The Samba share works with a Win98 computer.  I'm almost completely sure
the problem is in setting up the XP Pro.

Do you have to stick to using a wireless router? If a computer works why 
not put a Linux or other Unix-like firewall box in place and get an 
access point, which doesn't have all of the NAT and firewall stuff in 
it, and put that on your hub or switch? 

Access points are alot simpiler and the allow wireless clients to use a 
network's existing DHCP server etc. I decided long ago I'd never give 
up using a Linux or BSD-base firewall box since it offers way more 
flexibility. It also gives you more visibility when something isn't 
working.

I have the same problem with a SonicWall box at work -- large files 
(e.g. Linux
and OpenOffice distros) progress to a certain point and hang.  I suspect 
there
might be a time or size (N bytes or packets) limit on how long a TCP 
connection
entry may be kept in the firewall's state table.

It's only an annoyance, because the *real* firewall (and VPN router) is
a RedHat box doing iptables(8).  But if anyone can shed some light on this
problem, I would certainly appreciate it.

At one time, I had a former boss of mine install one of those routers at 
his home, and he had no end of troubles.  Eventually, we tried exchanging 
it at the store for another of the same type of unit, and all the problems 
went away.  It turns out he just had a flakey unit.

When I first saw AOL in action, I realized that only allowing a small
window to the whole internet was a bad thing.  Of course this only
affects people that already know what is out there, AOL customers don't
know any better, but they are still missing out.

I'm not denying that spam is a problem, but blocking out huge blocks of
addresses is similar to what AOL is doing with the whole internet.  Once
your filters are in place, how would you know if someone from China or
Brazil has tried to send you legitimate email?

I'm not blaming anyone, I'm just looking for the reasoning that would
lead someone to implement such aggressive blocking.  Every time I
explain to my clients what filtering will do, they all opt to live with
the spam.  I know this won't last too much longer, which means I need to
figure out a filtering scheme that my clients will go for.

Thanks for the discussion.

With the Gibraltar firewall (the next evolutionary step for the floppy
router), you can have your cake and eat it too.

It even comes with the hostap drivers, which runs the NetGear wireless
PCI cards.  The options for setting this up are amazing, and can quickly
be turned into an access point.  In fact you can run more than one
wireless card at a time!

Hardware requirements are not too bad (though the floppy router still
beats all), 64Megs of RAM and a BIOS capable of booting from CD.  USB is
really nice to have, but not required (PCI cards for USB are really
cheap).

I've had bizarre problems with the Linksys firewalls (usually related to
DHCP), both wired and wireless.  My advice is to take it back, and get a
USB storage device, new CD drive, and a NetGear PCI wireless card.  The
rest of the hardware should be really easy to find, the current version
of M$ software won't run on the machines that are perfect for this
setup.

Good Luck,

Derek Loree

And if you want to bind pine-like keystrokes to the command, in your .vimrc
you can include...

" Formatting the current paragraph according to
" the current 'textwidth' with ^J (control-j):
  nmap <C-J>      gq}
  vmap <C-J>      gq

The `vmap' command is for visual mode - you would highlight the text to be
mapped before doing the ^J.

Subject: [PLUG] Writing a script for use with LTSP...
Message-ID: <200307191329.AA1631453314@opusnet.com>

I've switched to dhcp 3 to get booting with PXE 
enabled cards to work.  Presto. Trouble is, 
the old bootp menu scheme I had with the whole 
option-128, etc. under dhcp 2 doesn't work in 
release 3 :-(  Figuring I have a Linux terminal 
boot anyways I've come up with the idea of 
using this system to select which system to 
boot at startup.  To that end I've programmed 
cron to reset links for all my terminals to the 
LTSP boot image every twenty images assuming 
those links could point to say a dos image or 
something else.  

The reasoning for using the LTSP 
system to choose the boot image is twofold:  
You have to authenticate through Linux login 
which is going to be familiar territory and
is also security conscious, I don't have to 
do weird things with the dhcp configuration 
other than restart dhcp every time there is 
a link change for a boot option.

So far I'm stumped: my current bash script is at 

ftp://ftp.robinson-west.com/linux/net-image.bash.

My script need this in short:

  1)  Who is executing me to
      determine their boot
      options.

  2)  From which terminal am
      I being called to choose
      the right link to modify.

  3)  The ability to perform the
      root task of changing the
      boot link for an ordinary 
      user without that user 
      entering the root password.

  4)  An init script to call 
      that will restart 
      dhcp after the links 
      are redone.

  *)  Admin is special and can 
      change any terminals' 
      boot option to any boot 
      image including 
      installation images.

I'm guessing this script needs 
suid bits?

In a test I manually changed a
terminal's link and restarted
dhcp which did change it's boot.
Twenty minutes later simply 
restarting dhcp thanks to my
current root owned cron job
that resets all links I put
that terminal back to LTSP.

I don't think that this is the basic belief, at least, not the
common interpretation of this. This statement would imply that I have
to listen to what everyone has to say, whoever they may be. I can never
walk away from you or tune you out because I "SHOULD allow anyone on the
net to communicate with anyone else" including myself.
I always interpreted that "should allow anyone to communicate with anyone"
belief as applying to the middleman, to everyone who is not the party to
this communication. For example, my ISP should not block the whole China
IP range. But on my own machine I have every right to do it.

There is a difference. AOL is imposing its restrictions on others, on the
people who are trying to communicate with each other. I, on the other
hand, have a right to decide whom do I want to communicate with. As far as
legitimate mail getting caught in the filters... first of all, for myself
I am the only one who can define "legitimate". If I don't want to talk to
you, that's the end of it. You have freedom of speech, I have freedom not
to listen. Second, again, for myself, I am the only one who can determine
the value of a possible legitimate mail I never get to see, and whether
the loss outweigths the gain.

> I'm not blaming anyone, I'm just looking for the reasoning that would
> lead someone to implement such aggressive blocking.
If it's the ISP blocking agressively, or any other sort of middle man,
then I don't think there is a reasoning (unless they do per-client blocks
and client is the one actually configuring it, then it's like the end user
blocking and the ISP just provides the tools and the labor).
If the end user does the blocks, the reasoning is very simple. This person
does not want to talk to some group of people. He has that right. Respect
it.

Which do you prefer to move 600-700MB files to a

I've been just moving the file to an accessible
directory and having the user click on the link-
but it really sucks the life out of my 256 KB/Sec
upload bandwidth, without much speed for the user
(around 25-30 KB/Sec).

Is there a better/faster/more efficient way? I'm

There isn't anything terribly different or "more useful" about the
PDXLUG knoppix iso over the standard knoppix.  They just changed the
splash screen and a few sundry details.  You can get the standard

Subject: [PLUG] Writing a script for use with LTSP...
Message-ID: <200307191539.AA904855824@opusnet.com>

I've done some revision on the script 
I am creating a short array 
with the two boot options I want to 
give to ordinary clients and I have 
modified the short menu test so that 
it is skipped for both admin and root.  
The short menu part of the program 
still doesn't do anything with
the selections as I don't know yet
how to detect what terminal I'm being
called from.

Right now I've discovered using my
modified script as root that it 
works since root can perform the 
symbolic link modifications :-)  

Now, how do I give an ordinary user,
namely admin, the ability through my 
script to change symbolic links under 
/tftpboot which is normally and in my 
case owned by user root group root? 

I imagine bash scripts can create and
read from files.  If I could write the
boot option and the link to change to
a file, maybe I could write another 
root owned cron script to read this 
file and perform the requested 
changes.

My biggest problem right now is 
figuring out for non root users 
which terminal they are on.  

Another thought is timing, 
you don't want to try to change 
your boot option when the cron 
job is going to change it back 
to ltsp before you reboot.  One 
thing I'd like to do with my 
script is output the current time 
and the recommended time to reset 
the terminal and boot into the new 
selection.  Changes requested 10 
minutes after the start of the 
current twenty minute period 
should probably be queued to 
be set one minute after the 
start of the next period.

Surprisingly, without restarting 
dhcpd my booting switched from 
memtest back to ltsp on it's own 
just from the timed link 
restoration I've set up.

Is there a way to read an ordinary 
user's environment variables from 
a root owned script?  The latter 
may offer an alternative to 
users writing their boot selections 
to files.

It looks like only root can change
these links which suggests to me
that my script is going to have
to record for non root users what
they want root to do unless my 
script can be treated as a root
program no matter who is using it.

Everything is about changing these
links under /tftpboot and knowing 
what terminal the request is coming 
from if the user is not admin or 
root.  Knowing which terminal to 
change prevents an ordinary user 
from modifying the boot option on 
another user's terminal where the
non root options aren't going to
be lethal though someone else 
changing them on you could be 
annoying.

The only way to change your upload speed is to pay for a faster
connection.  There are ways of speeding things up though.  How much
faster depends on the nature of the data and how much of it actually
changes from one download to the next.

The first thing you need to do is to compress it, the smaller the
download, the faster it will go.  If this is an ongoing procedure, you
might think about setting up rsync, it is a way to sync file systems on
different systems, which is very bandwidth friendly if most of the files
don't change.

Good Luck,

The problem is that the individuals are turning to the ISP's for help,
and the IPS's are turning on the filtering to "help" their customers. 
Just like AOL is "helping" their customers enjoy the internet.  I don't
know of any ISP that is not doing any filtering.  Some are even
filtering ports for their costumers, allowing no incoming requests to
any ports (even if you pay for a static  IP address).  If you want to
run any kind of server (like ssh, apache, or postfix), you have to
"upgrade" your service.  Some ISP's are filtering by attachment type,
any attachment that has certain 3 letter file extensions will be dumped.

A manifestation of this is incorrectly applied filters on the ISP
level.  This leads to all kinds of strange problems and creates serious
doubts about the ability to send and receive email.  Just last week, one
of my clients could send mail to Malaysia, but Malaysia couldn't send
mail back to my client.  It turns out the Malaysian ISP had applied spam
filters meant for incoming mail to the outgoing mail, not the incoming
mail.  So even though my clients subnet was on a Malaysian black list,
the email got through.  The Malaysian user was the one experiencing the
problem, by legitimately replying to legitimate email.

So, I agree, every individual has the right to choose how and with whom
to communicate, but that choice has very little meaning if it is
compromised by the ISP's.  Especially if the ISP's are using a method
that changes over time, then the individuals will have no way of having
the knowledge necessary to make the choices.  I know the mail account I
have with my ISP is useless because I never know at any particular time
what is being blocked and what isn't.  I have to keep checking it
though, it is the only way my ISP will communicate with me. 
Fortunately, they don't block any ports, and I am able to run my own
servers (and so far the netblock seems to be staying off the
blacklists).

Anyway, I'm starting to ramble.

  Finally put Slackware-9.0 on my fiancee's machine. Everything seems to be
working except networking. /sbin/ifconfig shows that eth0 is up and running.
The boot messages indicate that the LinkSys EtherFast 10/100 pcmcia card is
recognized and the NE2000 module is loaded. But, the lights on the network
card adapter plug don't come on and I cannot reach the network by pinging.

  How do I determine just where the problem might be?

  OK, now Slack-specific questions. When I installed the distribution, some
files were installed when I wasn't given the opportunity to deselect them.
How, in Slackware, do I determine what packages are installed? (The
equivalent of Red Hat's 'rpm -qa'.)

  Is the pkgtools what I use to completely remove unwanted packages?

recommendations if there is anyone out there using one.  Web interface is
nice but not required.  I've heard of ispman but have never tried it

I want to give one user the ability to add other users to get email within
his domain.  As well as control other aspects of the domain.  I have
webmin up and running and that is nice but I don't see how to allow a user
the ability to add users that would make the needed changes to postfix for
the users.

Thanks,

  I notice now the message in the boot sequence:

eth0: MII is missing.

  What does this mean, and what do I do about it?

  Got this all figured out: /sbin/pkgtool does it all.

I think OSU is releasing a program for this called Maintain. I saw a
demo of it here:

The main developer is Scott Kveton, who might have details on the GPL 
release date.

Two that come to mind for me is plesk and/or cpanel.  I've not used or 
investigated either but have seen them referenced on the isp-linux list 
found at isp-planet.com.  I'd normally recommend searching their archives, 
but the tool they provide is quite atrocious.  Probably a judicious use of 
google against that might bring some results.  This topic comes up quite 
frequently and is debated vigorously.

I worked in France for a while.  I went out and found a special dictionary of 
French computer terms and diligently learned them.  Then, once there, I found 
that the French had such charming terms as:

"le computer" NOT "l'ordinateur"

"le network" NOT "le reseau"

In fact, they quickly made me stop using the French terms almost entirely.  
The only one that they consistently used was "clavier" for keyboard.  They 
even said "mouse" instead of "souris" about half the time.

When I asked why they weren't using the French terms, they pointed out that 
they learned all this from English books.  Most computer books are printed in 
English.  If they are translated to French at all, it is often more than a 
year later.  Since most of the well educated French can read English fairly 
well, they just use the English books and do not wait for the French version.

The word 'email' has been in fairly high usage for about a decade.  So, as 
long as L'Academie Francaise takes this long to come up with new words for 
common things, the French will be speaking English with a funny accent 
relatively soon.

Best,
Kyle

I have one coworker that has a Linksys wireless router at home and he 
hasn't complained of any problems. I don't have a wireless router but I 
do own one of Linksys's newer 802.11g access points which apparently 
runs some version of Linux on a MIPS processor from what I've heard 
second-hand. 

I also heard that Linksys came clean and made their Linux source code 
available as there was a big stink about Linksys not releasing the 
source code over on /. not too long ago.

Subject: [PLUG] Writing a script for use with LTSP...
Message-ID: <200307200131.AA966852852@opusnet.com>

I've got my first working version of the project.

I'm calling this beta 1.  It's three scripts, two

are root scripts that cron runs and are time based

where the other can be used by any user it is set

up for.  I went for a file queue where a cron script

parses that queue and because the cron jobs are root

own the queue parsing script can set the links.  I'm

really just putting a single variable definition in

two files and sourcing them where presence or absence

of these files in my queue directory determines whether

or not a change is to be made.


There's a somewhat better readme file in the package 

itself.  I just used tar to put it together.  It should

be opened under /tftpboot so that the files go to the

right places.


I have the package available for download and would

appreciate any debugging help.  I programmed it in

bash 2.


The purpose of the scripts is to ease selecting a

different network boot image in an ltsp environment.

Prior to dhcp 3 I used a bootp menu but this is strange

and doesn't authenticated you to your Linux account.


It's on my ftp site at 

    ftp://ftp.robinson-west.com/net-image-beta1.src.tar
and ftp://ftp.robinson-west.com/net-image-beta1.src.tar.md5

for the md5 checksum.

So maybe we need a geek solution for the Winblows and Mac users--how about 
a proggie that does what spamassassin does, but without the necessity of 
running a mail server, and with graphical configuration?  Or maybe 
spamassassin works without and mail server and I just don't know it.  But 
something very like spamassassin, that could run in the background on a 
Winblows/Mac system, and filter mail as it hit the folders (before 
Outlook's filtering kicked in, or instead).  If it's free and easy to set

The MII is the NIC's Media Independent Interface. The MII is used to
autonegotiate link speed and duplexing settings.

If you've got a tool called mii-tool, you can run it as root to see if
your system think's it's got any MII-capable interfaces on your
system.

On Red Hat systems, mii-tool is shipped as part of the net-tools rpm
along with ifconfig, netstat, etc. The Slackware package-search tool
at slackware.com returns null sets when searching for 'mii-tool' and
'net-tools,' so I don't know what package might contain it.

That's my most-preferred option, however it requires an extra machine that
I don't have at present.  If I could come up with a box + 2 NICs + access
point for about $100, I'd do it today.

After a few more rounds with Linksys tech. support, they told me that it
might be a hardware problem and to take the router back for a replacement.
The personnel at the store where I bought it were nice enough to let me
exchange it for a Netgear router which explicitly states on the box
that it supports UNIX and Linux (I figure I ought to reward companies for
that sort of recognition).

Problem solved?  Well.... not quite.  The problem is less severe, but not
completely solved - all types of transfers seem to work on W2K, http
transfers seem to work ok on FreeBSD/Linux, but large ftp transfers are
hit-and-miss.  I'm trying to do a portupgrade of teTeX right now, and the
transfer dies after about 4meg; more tellingly, I still can't ftp from the
W2K box to the FreeBSD box unless I take them off the router.

So I suppose it's time to make a whole new bunch of friends at Netgear
tech. support... also, I have 30 days to return the Netgear, so if I can
come up with the parts to put my own firewall together in that time, I'll
take it back for a refund.

Thanks-

  Yes, in /sbin/mii-tool. However, when I run 'mii-tool -v' I see "No mii
transceiver present". Does this mean the card's bad? Or, ...?

I think it would be rare for a NE2000-like card to
have a MII. So, I think this is normal - just a
warning. It simply means that your Ethernet card can't
negotiate with link partners.

Ed,

  Thanks for the information. What I did was replace that card with the 3Com
3c574-tx from my notebook. The 100 mbps light instantly came on. So, for
whatever reason, I need to replace the LinkSys with a card that works in
that machine.

  Now the problem is that I cannot ping or otherwise connect to the network.
All /etc/host* files are the same as on the other boxes. When I type 'route'
on that laptop, I see three entries:

Destination	Gateway		Genmask	   	Flags  Metric  Ref	Use Iface
localnet	*		255.255.255.0	U	0	0	0   eth0
loopback	*		255.0.0.0	U	0	0	0   lo
default		router1 at appl-e	0.0.0.0		UG	1	0	0   eth0

  What am I missing, please?

  Found it. I hadn't corrected a mis-formed entry in /etc/hosts when I put

  OK -- it works. But, now I need to buy another network card.

have you for a pcmcia network card for use in the IBM ThinkPad 600E running

Subject: [PLUG] Contributing to a project like LTSP...
Message-ID: <200307201210.AA950927526@opusnet.com>

So I have written three bash scripts and developed a way to
change the boot image in an ltsp environment without becoming
root.  This is friendly since it simplifies things by avoiding 
use of a netbooted bootloader or modifications to dhcp.conf 
to create a bootp menu.  The latter isn't something I know 
how to do in ISC's dhcp 3 which I am now using.

I've put the first working release of my project on my ftp
site though so far I don't think anyone has checked it out.
I only finished it yesterday, I guess time will 
tell.  Anyone know where I can get a howto on writing the
init script for dhcp3?  I made the mistake of not copying
dhcp2's init file from the redhat package before I removed
the package.  I'm using a 7.3 system.

A general HOWTO on init script writing would be very helpful
as I need to troubleshoot what's wrong on my LFS Linux system 
as well.  I have an O'Reilly book on bash-2 though init script 
writing seems completely different.

I think with some good third party rework my scripts could
make a nice contribution to the LTSP project.  The only 
problem I didn't figure out is determining which terminal
an ordinary user should be allowed to change.

My ftp server is at ftp://ftp.robinson-west.com.
The project is tarred up as net-image-beta1.src.tar.
There's an md5 checksum there too.

Message-ID: <200307201216.AA590086420@opusnet.com>

It's the only MTA I have a 3000 page book on.  Also, sendmail is uber standard.
Historically, it's become shunned on grounds that it overly relies on shell
variables, is slow, is hard to configure with it's macro language, has buffer
overflow problems...  What makes qmail if anything inherently more secure than
sendmail?  I'm starting to think that some of qmail's secureness breaks things
you actually want to do.  These things include being able to recieve  mail
from anyone anywhere while at the same time blocking relay of mail for all
but users you wish to serve.  It is said that /var/spool/mail or /var/mail
is inherently insecure, but why?  Anyways, isn't there a way to do the same
moving of mailboxes to users' home directories with sendmail?  I would also
think that you could use Maildir with sendmail.

Most cards work. I did notice, however, that Slackware 9
has trouble with Tulip-based cards but I've been too
busy to find out why.

The best examples are to be found in /etc/rc.d/init.d
You'll pick up a lot of bash tricks.

  Thanks, Ed. The pcmcia card I suspect is _not_ using a Tulip-based chip.
However, since the NetGear cards I've had in the workstations for years are
so based, I guess I'll have to find out what the story is. In
/etc/rc.d/rc.modules there are drivers for Tulip cards. Wonder if P at rick
will answer a question I send him.

I have the 802.11g AP/Router from Linksys and it is being sent back this week.
It's really bad, as in it can't get a constant signal to my laptop when the
laptop is less then two feet away (While sitting on desk next to it) and it had
a lot of trouble going 40' to my basement or my room. I am going to replace it
with a DLink AP and a Shorewall firewall on a old P133. Also, the Router
software has some issues, we learned when I had some friends over. It doesn't
stream 220kB/s to each user, but rather 220kB/s to all users. When I was using a
Linux router via iptables, I was getting 220kB/s to all users - much faster.
Also, it didn't like to have 8 clients on at a time, and would randomly reset
the connection.

Try DLink :)

     -F file
     --info-script file
     --new-volume-script file
            Run a script at the end of each archive volume
            (implies -M).

     -M
     --multi-volume
            Create/list/extract multi-volume archive.

Now what that script actually does - I have no idea.

My Linksys works from one end of my house to the other without any 
problem so at this point I'm not interested in trying anything else 
since my access point works find. I've had my access point for several 
months and haven't had any problems with it.

I guess I must network under a lucky star or something. We also have 
several Linksys 802.11b and a one 802.11g access point in the office 
that we use for demos and stuff and they've all performed flawlessly 
for use.

I'm fond of Netgear's inexpensive FA311 PCI Nics as they seem to work 
well both under Linix and OpenBSD for me. I'm less impressed with some 
of Netgear's routers. We've got a Netgear FVS318 VPN Firewall appliance 
in our office and I haven't been impressed with the online 
documentation for the thing.  I tried following their documentation for 
Win2K for setting up a VPN tunnel with the FVS318 and it didn't work 
and they don't seem to keep their documenation up to date. The web 
setup screens in the documents I find on their site are different than 
what our firewall appliance has since we have a newer version of 
firmware installed in our box.

I was able to get OpenBSD's "isakmpd" working with the Netgear appliance 
so I have VPN access into our office from home now. For other people 
we've failed to get Win2K laptops working with VPN and people are very 
frustrated. We don't have the money for some slick firewall that has 
easy to use software for VPN access at this time and everyone keeps 
telling me how easy it was with the free Sonicwall software they used 
to use. 

Our Sonicwall hardware died and is not worth the expense to have the 
hardware repaired. For now our solution has been to buy people an 
FVS318 appliance for home use and given them step-by-step instructions 
to setup their end of the VPN tunnel. The FVS318 has been trouble free 
but it is limited and I find myself wanting to throw it out and put an 
OpenBSD firewall in. I still may do that but I'm not savy enough with 
the VPN setup to figure out if OpenBSD can easily handle multiple VPN 
tunnels simulataneously or not.

Seems to me that would simply indicate the software doesn't recognize
any MII transceiver in the system. 

It doesn't mean the card is good, bad or otherwise.

With phpGroupWare you don't need to expose Samba to the internet  Not only does it
include SquirrelMail but you also have a filemanager, shared addressbook, shared
calendar and a ton of other shareable modules that you may or may not be interested in.

I have an HP OfficeJet T45.  It was pretty inexpensive.  Its an All in
One (Fax/Scan/Printer/Copier).

It works nicely.  The driver for the HP line is an opensource driver
project driven by HP (hpoj.sf.net).  It was a little tricky getting to
work before RH9, but now with cups, a modern ghostscript, and a clean
build it should be close to plug and play (it was identified by ku

It has held up for over 3 years.  Just recently I have had something
wonky, but it seems to have been fixed by opening all the portals, and
moving all the parts carefully.

Cartridge prices are OK.  Fry has a 3rd party brand that works.  It is a
3 color cart (and a Black one).

I can pretty darn High-Res color, and nice fast draft prints.

Subject: [PLUG] Announcing a beta release of Red Hat Linux: Severn (fwd)
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0307210752330.8246@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

---------- Forwarded message ----------

   Thank you gentlemen. This is rumor control. Here are the facts.
   As some of you know, new Red Hat Linux Beta bits crash landed
   here at 1000 on the morning watch. There was one survivor.
   Two dead processes, and a daemon that was hopelessly smashed
   beyond repair. The survivor is called SEVERN.

It's that time again.
 (Time to floss?)
 (Time to make a gooky?)

No, it's time for a Red Hat Linux Beta, named SEVERN.

   "I just want to say that I took a vow of stability. That also
   includes betas. We all took the vow. Now let me say, that I
   for one, do not appreciate Company policy allowing beta bits
   to freely intermingle..."

   "Cheeky bastard, right sir?"

   "What brother means to say is ... We view the presence of
   any outside OS, beta, as a violation of the stability, a
   potential break in the spiritual unity."

   We are well aware of your feelings in this matter. You will
   be pleased to know that I have requested a testing team -
   Hopefully, they will be here inside of a few hours and
   evaluate it A.S.A.P.

As always, betas such as SEVERN are not intended for use on
production environments. Use as such could lead to your machines
being slaughtered like pigs by the dragon. Or just public laughter.

Problems with SEVERN should be reported via bugzilla, at:

         http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/

   What's its development status?

   "It doesn't seem too horrendously in flux. Difficult at this
   moment to make a specific diagnosis."

Among other things, SEVERN has:
 - a new graphical boot
 - GCC 3.3
 - an updated 2.4.21 kernel
 - updated Evolution and Mozilla
 - and more!

   Will it live?

   "Yes, I should think so."

   Look, none of us here is naive. It's in everybody's best
   interests if this beta doesn't come out into production until
   the testing team is through with it. And certainly not
   without the proper qualification and bug reports. Right? So
   we should all stick to our set routines and not get
   unduly agitated. Correct?  All right. Thank you gentlemen.

Speaking of unduly agitated... there's lots of rumors going on
about Red Hat Linux. We've been doing it for nearly ten years
now, and in that time, there's been various changes. From
rpp to RPM, from Red Hat Commercial Linux to Official Red Hat
Linux, from 'install' to anaconda. And now, we're making another
change.

We changed the rules. We said our Linux should be your Linux. Just as
most of the software in Red Hat Linux is developed in an open
fashion, so should Red Hat Linux itself; driven by those who
develop, test, document, and translate. To accomplish this, we're
opening up our process.

Now this is an evolution, not a revolution. The first steps will
be moving much of our development discussions and schedules
external, via mailing lists and other means, and including external
developers in the process of making technical decisions. More
will be done from there. Red Hat Linux will remain as it has been; a
freely available general purpose operating system, released on the
average every six months. For more information, see:

  http://rhl.redhat.com/

  rhl-beta-list-request at redhat.com

with

in the subject line. You can leave the body empty. Or see:

Thanks to everyone that responded. I was able to
obtain a used HP LaserJet 845C, which is also
supported by HP's driver.

Speaking of Fry's, I was there yesterday and noticed
that they no longer stock any SCSI CD drives of any
type (CD_ROM, CD-R, etc.).

I will look into this tonight.  As far as I can remember I am not 
blocking DHCP packets.  Why
would this shut down the internet for 2 minutes for about every 1 to 2 
hours of uptime?  I would
think that if the router was blocking DHCP packets it would be down and 
that would be it.
Thanks for the info.

that is a very interesting idea.

Our problem is that our mail front ends and our mail backends 
are distributed across many machines. And that we have
sendmail at the core.

So we have some fundamental design questions to look at.

 % 
 % In /etc/postfix/main.cf modify your mailbox_transport parameter to this:
 % 
 %   mailbox_transport = cyrus_procmail
 % 
 % The cyrus_procmail definition is one you will create in
 % /etc/postfix/main.cf.
 % 
 % Back up your modification in main.cf with this added line in 
 % /etc/postfix/master.cf:
 % 
 %   cyrus_procmail  unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
 %   flags=R user=cyrus argv=/usr/bin/procmail -m /etc/procmailrc ${user}
 % 
 % This calls procmail in "general purpose" mode and will pass the 'user'
 % argument to /etc/procmailrc... a parameter that as I understand it is
 % usually lost.
 % 
 % Finally, simply add the following to your /etc/procmailrc file as best
 % suits your needs:
 % 
 % ###########################################################
 % ### Deliver it to the user inbox
 % ###########################################################
 %

Hi all,
	Ed, I work here at HP in Vancouver. I am the hpoj and hpijs support person for linux.
If you have any questions at all about HP specific products or compatibility, feel free to ask me or send an email to 
linux_deskjet at hp.com and I can answer it there. Since you only need a single function printer, an AIO would be overkill.
If you swear up and down, you're never going to print a photo and just need okay color occasionall, then the 3420 might suit your needs.
It looks like a big tootsie roll. It folds up nicely and prints pretty average. That is our lowest cost printer.

Cory

5 levels of quoting?  Come people, snip judiciously.  Just a small note 
wrt vpns.  In the words of the freeswan folks, "Tunnels are cheap."  Set 
'em up as necessary.  I'd say that your OpenBSD host can handle many 
tunnels quite easily.  I can't remember if OpenBSD ipsec code is derived 
from FreeSwan (I think it is),  it's still worthwhile to make a trek to 
www.freeswan.ca and take a look at the performance documention that the 
maintainers have put together.

Good god man, don't say that with any OpenBSDers around; you'll be
hanged!  It quite definitely isn't, otherwise FreeS/WAN wouldn't suck
quite so much.  (It probably wouldn't suck quite so much if they'd
accept contributions from USians too.)  FreeS/WAN has gotten a lot
better over the years and is quite usable; OTOH, OpenBSD's IPSEC
implementation is very likely the oldest among free OSes and from what
I've read, quite stable and mature.

Install the rpmdb-redhat rpm and you'll be able to use

rpm -q [ --redhatprovides | --redhatrequires ]

to find what provides what.  Or you can install apt, yum, or up2date and
let it handle the dependencies.  See http://www.freshrpms.net.

No. You may have to restart applications and daemons that
rely on the hostname being correct though. For example, if
your shell prompts display the hostname, it may
continue to display the old hostname until you reload the
shell by, say, logging out and back in. There may be
references to the old hostname in configuration or data
files such as the SSH known_hosts file.

Don't forget any DNS implications of the change.

Actually a lot of systems set the hostname in /etc/sysconfig/network, so
rebooting will reset the hostname if done on the command line, and/or by
editing /etc/HOSTNAME

PLUG,

	We are working hard to get Maintain out under the GPL. It is set to be released "any day now." If any of you are interested in being notified once it has been released just send us a e-mail at maintain-devel at lists.orst.edu. 

	On a related note, I just updated the below demo to the most recent CVS version. There are still some features that are being worked on for the release. Feel free to submit bug reports :-)

I think OSU is releasing a program for this called Maintain. I saw a
demo of it here:

http://oss.oregonstate.edu/maintain/demo/login.php

The main developer is Scott Kveton, who might have details on the GPL 
release date.

There are a few, but they are not the easiest to use.

MainActor looks nice, but it refuses to run with Redhat 9. It also seems 
to not be actively maintained.

Kino is pretty nice.  Does great DV captures.  I have run into a couple of 
bugs in the edit process though.

Cinelera is a mamoth program that appears to do everything.  It is a pain 
to install from source.

All of these may or may not work on Mandrake.  None appear to be included 
in the main distribution.

Kino is available in the Mandrake contrib ftp site.  

Try looking at ftp://ftp.orst.edu/pub/mandrake/9.1/contrib .  They also 
have other versions there.

How can I determine what device to set so that I can sync my handheld?

need to place (for instance) 50 MB files on an FTP location, and they'll 
forget to remove it later.  So I cobbled this script up (from one that was 
posted to the plug list) to delete files older than one day (so files posted 
on Monday would be deleted Tuesday Night.)

this is the script:

#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/find /var/ftp/pub/ -type d -mtime +1 -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -rf
/usr/bin/find /var/ftp/incoming/ -type d -mtime +1 -print0 | xargs -0 \
	 /bin/rm -rf


Yes, pretty simple stuff.
It works - mostly. It would work perfectly if it didn't truncate the 
directories; it removes the pub/ and the /incoming directories. 

How would I go about fixing it?

Hey Michael,

You many want to join the LTSP or K12LTSP lists for terminal server
questions...

	http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ltsp-discuss
	https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/k12osn

As for your question...

I assume you are looking at this line:

	X Display Name:                test-bed.robinson-west.com:0

That is the same as the $DISPLAY variable.

It sounds like you are trying to use the $DISPLAY variable as some
sort of security check. If that is correct, it is a bad idea considering
that users can change the environment variable themselves.

It also breaks if they log in via VNC or SSH or some other mechanism.
I'm working on using SSH rather than XDM in K12LTSP, it breaks a bunch
of my scripts because the $DISPLAY variable is something like localhost:10
rather than myterminal:0

This way:

#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/find /var/ftp/pub/* -type d -mtime +1 -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -rf
/usr/bin/find /var/ftp/incoming/* -type d -mtime +1 -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -rf

This way, the argument you pass to find doesn't include pub or incoming,
just things that match under it.

Note that neither method does diddly to hidden directories.

I have used my Visor Deluxe with both redhat and suse.  Most packages expect 
that you are using /dev/pilot. in my case I have always found my visor on 
/dev/usb/ttyUSB1.  Under Redhat I had a symlink to /dev/pilot.  If I remember 
correct the command is 'ln -s /dev/usb/ttyUSB1 /dev/pilot'.  I personally 
have been using jpilot and kpilot (I don't use gnome desktops) so I hope this 
helps.

D'oh. Foiled by the star. 
Thanks Jeme.

I'm not _too_ worried about hidden directories- 98% my users wouldn't know 
how to create one. Of course, there's always the two you have to watch, but I 
have my means. :)

I am looking to hire a qualified person to do some part time work.

Requirements are:

Understand administration of RedHat Linux server for hosting web sites and 
email users.
Needs to understand Sendmail, and other types of email servers.
Needs to understand Bind and setting up DNS.
Needs to understand setting up FrontPage with Apache.
Needs to understand how to make RPMS for installing updates to 
Apache,Bind,Sendmail and other programs needed in a Web Hosting environment.

You need to be in the Portland Vancouver area.
Please contact me off list with a phone number and your qualifications and 
a good time to call you.

Understand That I am not looking for a consultant. I am looking for 
somebody to set eye to eye with and game plan the best way to set up a 
RedHat Linux server for Hosting.  I figure around 20 hours total maybe a 
little more. I will pay well for the right person.

I think comcast uses bootstrap on port 69 as a keep alive. Probably your
problem. Typical situation is you get an ip, a couple hours later, a server
checks to see if you're still there, if not, it drops you, your box
recognizes this a couple minutes later and the process begins again.

I might be wrong, but check your logs for inbound connections to port 69 and
/ or "bootstrap agent" from an comcast server.
Good luck.

Subject: [PLUG] UDP/ICMP packet loss question on RH
Message-ID: <p05210640bb43f35fe4a1@loligo.com>

[sending a second time, in the hopes that this merely caused some 
consternation and research by those of you Who May Know The Answer]

Forgive my ignorance if this is an obvious question, but I am not a 
hardcore Linux person, and so my experiences with the Linux TCP/IP 
stack are limited.  I am, however, quite fluent with UNIX network 
protocols and this is an issue that I have not been able to 
adequately Google-search due to the number of hits I get with the 
keywords.

I am trying to track down a problem with some VoIP RTP stream jitter 
and (perhaps) loss, and the first test I did was to see if a crude 
UDP packet loss test would pass.  My results were inconclusive.

My test was to send 100 UDP packets via the 'traceroute' program, and 
see how many came back.  Yes, I know that only half the trip is UDP 
and the other is ICMP, but I figured it would be a clue that I should 
dig more deeply in that direction.

Here is what I got (IP address and hostname changed to protect the guilty):

[root at gw3 asterisk]# traceroute -f 4 -q 100 10.0.1.33

Note that roughly every sixth packet has been dropped.  "Very 
strange," I said, "but let's try that on some other hosts to see if 
it's consistent."  Indeed, every Linux Redhat 7.2 and Redhat 8.0 host 
I tested came back with the same symptoms, even between hosts on the 
same LAN (where, by the way, I am experiencing no problems with any 
VoIP RTP strangeness, even with the same codecs, so it's not a 
"problem".)

Now, I have been unable to answer my first question about VoIP 
badness (which I think may be software related elsewhere) but my 
investigation makes me wonder why something is dropping these 
packets, either inbound UDP or outbound ICMP.  No other OS I tested 
against showed the same symptoms.  Is this some kind of rate-limiting 
feature in Linux?  I know that IOS will not process more than a 
certain %age of packets that are ICMP outbound from the router 
itself; perhaps someone thought that was a good idea to include in 
the Linux TCP/IP stack.

(Don't harass me about the version of Redhat I'm running, or that I'm 
running Redhat.  I don't own these systems, I'm just the consultant.)

I'm not a consultant nor am I in need of part-time work but I'm still
curious as to why you stipulate no consultants. At first glance it seems
like this project would be a perfect fit for outsourcing. Would it be
possible for you to share this position so that the Consultants on the
list might understand a little better, and possibly adjust the way that
they do business to better serve folks like you?

  From my perspective, Ed, a consultant is one who works more than 40 hours
a week, loses weekends when clients call Friday afternoon with a crisis that
must be fixed by Monday morning, and have more control over their lives and
livlihood than do those working for others.

  However, when business is slow, some consultants work only 20 hours a week
whil others increase their marketing efforts even more.

Help! :0

I'm trying to upgrade our PHP and I'm running into alot of dependencies. Not
a problem, but it's a real PITA hunting down all the RPMS.

The actual issue is when I get to an RPM that doesn't have any dependency
issues (i.e., it should install just fine). It goes through the install, I
watch the hash marks go across the screen then I get a Segmentation fault.
Every time. Happens with two different packages right now,
libdbtcl3.3-3.3.11-13mdk.i586.rpm and libintl2-0.11.5-2mdk.i586.rpm
RPM version is 4.0.3

Any help?

I haven't found any answer in just a minute or two of Googling, but I do
seem to recall that FreeBSD by default does some kind of rate limiting
on icmp packets. Perhaps certain Linux kernels do as well?

I would suspect you're seeing missed icmp ttl expired messages, rather
than missing udp source packets.

Michael,

I don't have any Mandrake-specific experience, but you might try
wrapping strace around rpm to see where the failure is really taking
place, e.g.,

  strace -o /tmp/rpm-trace rpm -Uvh libintl2-0.11.5-2mdk.i586.rpm

Toward the end of the rpm-trace file, you should get some hints as to
what system calls are leading to the segfault.

Are you running a custom-built kernel by chance? The rpm utility makes use 
of certain entries under /proc that aren't there if you don't select the 
right kernel build options. Worse, rpm doesn't fail gracefully if those
/proc entries are missing. It usually just seg faults.

Nope, not custom, as far as I remember, other than the options I selected
during install. It was a pretty vanilla Mandrake 8.1 install off of CDs that
I purchased.

Is there any way to get the entries that it's looking for in there? (please
note my n00bness...)

Well, I ran it. I don't know really what I'm looking for, tho'.

I looked through the rpm-trace file that it creates but couldn't see
anything that was obvious. If I post the whole thing, it's a huge text
file - ~240k. If there's something specific I should be looking for, I can.
But I need to know what :P

Thanks, all!

Okay, I took another look. This is the last section of the rpm-trace file:

open("/lib/ld-linux.so.2", O_RDONLY)    = 13
read(13, "\177ELF\1\1\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0\3\0\1\0\0\0p\n\0\000"...,
1024) = 1024
fstat64(13, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0755, st_size=621127, ...}) = 0
old_mmap(NULL, 77300, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE, 13, 0) = 0x4064b000
mprotect(0x4065d000, 3572, PROT_NONE)   = 0
old_mmap(0x4065d000, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED, 13,
0x11000) = 0x4065d000
close(13)                               = 0
--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---
+++ killed by SIGSEGV +++

So, I looked for /lib/ld-linux.so.2 and it's there. It's a pointer to
ld-2.3.1.so. Now what? I'm not even sure that the error occurred on the
close - or did it?

The strace trick will show you which /proc entries it's trying to open.

Maybe not necessary with rpm, but I am in the habit of giving strace
the -f option too, which will also strace any processes that fork.

This isn't help.

But I sure do wonder why folks run RPM based distributions.  This kind of
question pops up every couple of weeks (if not days).

I don't know if the problems Dirk has with apt-rpm are endemic or just
Dirk's, but I sure would recommend an APT based solution for systems that
require stability and package management.

Of course, even apt-rpm isn't going to solve your problem because the RPMs
aren't listing their dependency information properly.  As a note, I've
never had that problem with a Debian package.

1. Make sure the packages themselves are good.  Verify with 
  rpm -K packagefile

2. Rebuild your database with 'rpm --rebuilddb', perhaps first removing
/var/lib/rpm/__db.00[123].

Does this mean that the part-time, non-consultant becomes
an employee for 20 hours?
That he/she doesn't have to work the weekend when there's an
emergency?

Don't think that I haven't thought of it, maybe going to Debian. Or even a
source-based distro, like Sorcerer.
That's not *too* much work, is it? :P

I think making a public request, the way you did, is a perfect way to find a 
good Linux guru. The weeding-out part is easy, right away you can eliminate 
the ones who cannot follow simple instructions. Then eliminate the ones that 
personally annoy you, for whatever reason. 

If you follow the list regularly, you'll probably find some kindred spirits, 
and can see who is knowledgeable and helpful, and can contact them directly.

Subject: [PLUG] Thinkpad OEM adventures
Message-ID: <200307231325.13985.pluglist@bratgrrl.com>

This may be helpful to some of you- 

Scenario: Shiny new IBM Thinkpad R32, with built-in wi-fi, modem, sound, and 
Ethernet.
Everything is supported in Linux except the #$@!$$ modem- dammit IBM, would it 
KILL you to use one of the many modems that are supported in Linux? What did 
you spend that billion Linux bucks on, anyway?

Ok. Preloaded with XP Pro, which I want because my clients use it, so I 
probably ought to look at it or something. No software disks came with it. 
Nope not one. It has a sekrit recovery partition on the hard drive, which 
eats up about 1.5 gigabytes. I call and request a recovery CD, which they 
ship for free.

My plan was to use Knoppix to shrink the NTFS partition, then install some 
flavor o Linux and dual-boot. Knoppix comes with QTParted, which is a great 
GUI front-end to parted and ntfs-resize. That's right, it resizes NTFS 
partitions non-destructively. Yay, like Partition Magic, only free.

Well a curious thing happened with winduhs. QTParted said I needed to defrag. 
Brand new and never touched- but oh well. I fire up XP and do a defrag. It 
was still no good- the dirty bugger parked a couple of files waaaay down at 
the end of the drive, so it still took up the entire hard drive. Maybe there 
is a clever way to move these files without paying for something like 
Speeddisk, but I do not know what it is. 

So I used Knoppix to delete all the partitions, including the recovery 
partition, and create a winderz partition and a linux partition. Then when I 
ran the recovery CD, windows is confined to a 6-gigabyte cell, and the rest 
is for Linux. 

lspci is your very good friend for determining chipsets, which you need to 
know to choose Linux drivers. IBM won't tell you. (dear IBM, regarding your 
great love for Linux, there seems to be a gap or two...) The sound chip and 
modem apparently share the same IRQ, I imagine windoze has some sort of 
clever hack to manage this, but as far as I can tell the modem won't work in 
Linux at all. (Agere AC 97, formerly Lucent, prolly something else next week)

Moral: no matter how many scammy tricks microsoft tries to pull, no matter how 
chicken hardware vendors are to support Linux, our brilliant Linux 
programmers foil them again and again. Thank you very much, folks!

I've been running Debian on an R31 for about 6 months.  I haven't
tried to get the modem working, but I have a few bookmarks that say
it's possible.  I think it's the same modem in your R32.

FYI, I had to set up a T30 as dual-boot recently.  There wasn't time to
get the recovery CD, and I felt better leaving the partition be.
I turned it on and the first thing it did on bootup was tell me it was
converting its FAT32 parition to NTFS.  Dang!

So I did the recovery procedure, and when it rebooted itself, I hit F12
and booted Rescue Mode from a Red Hat 9 CD.  I then used GNU PartEd to
shrink the FAT32 partition down by a few gigs (it properly resized the FS
and moved the data out of the way--woo!)  I rebooted and let Windows do
its silliness.  Once I was satisfied it was happy, I installed Linux in
the space I'd made.

Never mind.  It was from sourceforge which makes the link look like an 
actual .rpm file when you mouse over it but really brings you to the mirror 
selection page.  Wish they wouldn't do it that way.

I think people were just trying to understand your parameters and
didn't understand the consultant exclusion.  They were trying to get
you to explain what you meant, that's all.  

Sometimes the sender's message gets garbled a little in translation
somewhere along the way.  If the receivers get a bad checksum, the
responsible thing to do is send a NAK or BAD CRC message back so the
sender can retransmit.  Metaphorically speaking.  I think that is all

Message-ID: <3F1EFB36.9080307@pacifier.com>

I just ran across this format and grabed the pre-compiled binary here
http://djvu.sourceforge.net/

The command line viewer and the plugin (possibly one and the same) is 
fantastic.  The mouse wheel works!  Unfortunatly, keyboard arrow keys 
advance a page instead of scrolling, and the pg-up/down keys do nothing.
Printing looks good,

Anyway, looks like this format may replace pdf (it's much smaller), so when 
you see it, you know where to get it.

Cheers,

  wish is the shell for invoking TCL/TK programs.  The "xconfig" program
uses TK widgets make it's GUI.  The wish program is owned by "tk-8.3.3-65"
package on my RH8.0 system.

  Buy a doc CD?  I don't use them.  There's plenty of info on the RH web
site and google.  The docs CD on the other releases has mostly been Linux
Doc Project books anyway.  You can find LDP docs at http://en.tldp.org/.

And speaking of dead trees I just subscribed at http://safari.oreilly.com
and love it.  When the new O'Reilly catalog arrived I realized I was
looking at $300 for some titles I'd only need for a short time period. (I
already own a sizable collection of O'Reilly and other publisher books
already but do sometimes forget to pack them from or to home.) At
$9.95/month for 5 titles it is about half the cost.  I do have to keep a
title on my bookshelf for 30 days but I can access it from home or work or
anywhere there is Internet access and don't have to remember more than my
username and password (instead of remembering I need a book at work today
and at home tonight.)  The down side is it's more difficult to access from
the typically non-wired locations ie. porcelain library.

I don't know if this is relevant, but we had problems with systems receiving
heavy (>50Mbit/sec) multicast (i.e. UDP) streams. Problem solved by 
increasing
the following buffer size(s) [Thanks, Galen!]

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# SVS-3500
# -- UDP working buffer sized to accept heavy incoming multicast
# streams without discarding packets
net.core.rmem_default = 524288
net.core.rmem_max = 524288

(The above lines were added to /etc/sysctl.conf on RedHat 7.3 systems.)

Thanks, that's actually useful for other applications and I'll store 
that away, but I don't think it does anything for me in this 
particular question - these are very low speed streams - 1kbps or 
less.  I shouldn't be overrunning any buffers here.  Plus, with 
multiple tests, each end station gets the same packet loss to the 
target no matter how many testers there are (I tried with four) which 
leads me to think that this is a per-stream issue.

You'll probably get better help on the linux-net list:

http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#linux-net

This is mostly kernel developers, but I think your problem is
sufficiently advanced that those are probably the best people to answer
your question.

I don't know if you have or can have Linux hosts on either end, but you
can use the 'ttcp' problem to test, which might give you more
information (it works w/UDP too, name notwithstanding).

Have you looked at the sysctl options?  There does seem to be a
ratelimit to ICMP packets of 100/jiffy (which is normally 100/sec), if
I'm reading it correctly.  The networking sysctl docs are in the kernel
source at linux/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0307231834450.17675@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  In the Slackware-9.0.0 installed on a ThinkPad 600E, /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 is
configured for a static IP address. Today I purchased a new NIC (from ENU)
and now the system cannot find an eth0 interface! Trying to run
'/sbin/ifconfig eth0 up' fails.

  Putting in the 3Com card works just fine.

  The card I purchased is a Zonet ZEN1200 that says on the box it works on
linux. Boot messages found a 8139too interface. I uncommented that module in
/etc/rc.d/rc.modules and rebooted. No difference.

  Any thoughts?

  According to the linux on laptops Web site, the Zonet fast ethernet cards
require the pcnet_cs module. Anyone know where I can find such a beast for
the 2.4.20 kernel in Slackware-9.0.0?

  Or, if I bring it back, where can I get a fast ethernet NIC, pcmcia card
that works? I know the 3Com ones do.

Hey Rich;

Here's a couple of interesting links that you can look too:

http://joshua.raleigh.nc.us/docs/linux-2.4.10_html/326168.html
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcmcia-cs/

The first is the source for pcnet_cs, the second is the project source
for the pcmcia-cs project.

Hope that helps,

Steve

Sharing of IRQs is most likely not the problem. Sharing is very common these
days and the core of the Linux kernel supports it. There are particular device
drivers however that do not support sharing. Writing a device driver that's
willing to share take a little extra effort on the part of the programmer, plus the
peripheral itself must be able to support sharing, which most do any more.

I think you're right to suspect the modem itself. Despite IBM's generally
enthusiastic attitude toward Linux, laptop modems is one area where they've
not come around. There was a proprietary Lucent Winmodem device
driver for Linux that was available for a while, partly at the urging of IBM.
But then I heard rumors of GPL violations in the driver and I've not see it
since. That was three years ago.

Look into amavisd-new if you want to restrict file types like that. 
You'll also be able to filter spam and plug-in real virus-scanners if

The latter is how I know I'm on the plug list verses the provo list for
example...  Really though, shouldn't this saying worry about the definition
of freedom?  There are after all some interpretations of freedom that only
a fool would endorse, not that anyone on this list would tend to be a fool 
given the opportunity ;-)  This Somerset guy, I only agree with his anti materialism statement...  the first part is auspiciously arrogant.

I'm going through a technology vs. Linux headache myself.  I have this Pentium
4 system I've almost sunk $800 bucks into only to find that the sound card
support is A) proprietary and B) comes with a warning that it will seg
fault on Quake and potential other popular Linux software where I may find 
sound is essential.  I'm not an EE, electrical engineer, but if I was I'd 
show these Intel weirdos that it makes more sense to integrate preexisting
hardware that is broadly compatible than it is to try and invent your own
all the time and assume its enough to slap a disclaimer on it.  There was 
a time in the 386 era when nothing was integrated and you had real control 
over hardware, will we ever see those days again?  Less integration may
have meant more cost but how much does it cost to throw out a whole entire
motherboard let alone potentially the processor too?

Who makes alsa sound cards anyways?!?

[Daniel Petcher]
No, we will never see those days in the computer industry again. The
trend toward more and more integration continues. From vacuum tubes to
solid state discrete logic to integrated circuit chips continuing to
Programmable Logic Arrays and the utter disappearance of peripheral
cards (your present complaint), systems indeed are getting more
integrated. Each manufacturer wants ALL of the money involved in the
making of your computer. Each manufacturer wants to be unfettered by
other manufacturers' design compromises.

Returning to the matters I snipped-out from your complaint, Intel *IS*
working to support Linux in numerous areas. I sit about 50 feet away
from a bunch of guys who spend the whole day testing Intel network
software against most of the major distributions of Linux as well as
xBSD, UnixWare, and Solaris. Micro$oft doesn't own the whole industry
and they are not the only OS vendor that gets support from hardware
manufacturers, Intel or otherwise.

I don't speak for Intel. They don't speak for me. I'm just working a
contract to try and find bugs in their network cards and software before
you see them in the real world.

You can still find motherboards without sound and video and modems, etc,
integrated onto them; it is hard (or perhaps impossible) to find one
without an IDE controller build into it though.  

Personally, I don't want to go back to the bad old days - I like not
having to buy 3 cards to supply video, sound, and ethernet and have no
trouble finding motherboards that are compatible with linux.  Also from
what I can remember one can buy four P4 motherboards and CPUs for the
cost of one 386mb+cpu back in the day.

I like my motherboards being all in one, other then video. Separate video is
better because no onboard does decent graphics.

This is similar to issues I am having after upgrading RH7.3-RH9.  In my
case it is a glibc issue.  rh7.x uses an older glibc that is compatible 

So to trace this you must:

1) Eliminate the variables
2) Test the remaining issues.

So to figure out if its the packages, or rpm that is failing.  Upgrade
something else.  Even if you have --force it. (Or delete and add it back
in, then delete it, add an old one, then the new one).

If that works, then focus on the packages.  Are they for your distro? 
Could they be hitting a glibc issue?  If they have a static program for
a different glibc that runs in postconfig, then they could fail.

Next you can rebuild the src rpms "rpm --rebuild ....src.rpm"  For most
packages this is an easy solutions.  For php this may cause other issues
if the various devel packages are not there.  The impact of finding the
devel packages is the same on all systems for monster packages like
php.  It wants a little of everything, and all their devel files.  php
is one of those things that is very painful to build on your own,
without knowing *precisely* what you want out of it.  A simple example. 
You want to load an web-mail program on there.  Well the php programmers
for the email program used function calls from the imap libraries, mysql
libraries and the gd libraries.  Even if you do not use those
technologies, php will start barfing obscurely (its better now).

This why getting a pre-built of php is often paramount (I have re-built
php, and the php rpms often for old systems, it is not fun).

Hopefully you do not need to rebuild the packages.  Before you do, email
the maintainers.

If rpm -Uvh failed for all packages do the following:



  rm -rf /var/lib/rpm/__db*
  rpm --rebuilddb

If that take too long, add -vv to the rpm line.  It is working. 
Recently it too over 10 minutes to finish.  I had done bad thigns tot he
db, and it needed cleaning.

Try rpm-Uvh again.

If rpm is failing for other packages run
  rpm -qa > filename

See if it segfaults.  No?  Then rpm base binary is OK.

  rpm -Va > filename

Review the filename for lines with a 5 in it.  This is an md5sum change
from the installed file.  This will tell you if something is not
correlating with the rpm database.

You can always run ldconfig before running rpm, just to see if that
helps.

After this you have something odd with the system.  Report with more
info (Distro, results from above tests, etc.).

Also think back (look in the history files) and see if anything was done
to the system.

How about  doing an rpm2cpio on the rpm and seeing if the package is
complete.  You can actually get a file list and information directly
from the package by using:

rpm -qilp package.name.rpm

Subject: [PLUG] printer issue
Message-ID: <1059079072.2318.13.camel@zadie>

hi,

I will say this: I have not used CUPS before and so this may be a stupid
problem, but I have checked a bunch of sources online including cups.org
and google and have not found a solution yet.

I have a new-to-me HP Laserjet IIP+ that prints beautifully under
Windows, but will not print consistently under Linux. It's set up under
CUPS as an HP Laserjet II series using Gimp Print, and I have made sure
to set the paper to Letter (this will be important momentarily).

When trying to print from OpenOffice, I have the settings there using
Letter as well, and not A4 as everything seems to default to. But tell
it to print and the printer says:

LC LOAD
A4

and will not be pacified until you reboot it.

In actuality, there's a little more: when I had it set to A4 in CUPS
(the default), this is all I got. When I set it to Letter I could get
CUPS to print a test page, but then OO.o returned the signal. When I
finally found the OO.o configuration for Paper size, it printed only the
top left corner of the page, magnified to fill the page. 

And as another side note, the CUPS printer only shows up in the OO.o
available printers on one machine, with an older (1.0.1) version of
OO.o. With a newer version (1.0.3) it doesn't, but when I print to
Generic Printer, it seems to go to the CUPS queue just fine.

I found several pages suggesting that the problem with this error
message is that the computer is asking the printer to print A4 paper and
the printer is finding that it doesn't have any. This seems ... odd. And
I don't know where else to request letter.

Thoughts?

Thanks,

Jeff

It should be set up as a IIP, not a II

Yeah, the IIP driver didn't come with my installation of gimp-print, but
I just added the PPD and tried it and I don't get any farther. I no
longer have the A4 problem--put it on A4, put it on Letter, and it does
the same thing--the printer just sits there idle saying Ready. Meanwhile
CUPS first attempts to stop the printer, then when I tell it to start
again and then give it something to print, it aborts the job.

So I went back and looked through linuxprinting.org and went and
rechecked that I'd installed everything. In fact I hadn't -- I was
missing some of the foomatic things (what a cool name) and I added
those, and ... ta da! I was back to LC LOAD / A4.

grr. Stupid printer.

Any more thoughts?

I've experimented with the "Reply-By" header mentioned in this article a
bit, and suspect the pop-up message is only observed an hour after the
deadline passes. So it might be preferable to pick the current date and
have the message 'expire' after arrival. For example you could put the
lines below in .muttrc.

my_hdr X-Message-Flag: Install Linux
my_hdr Reply-By: `date +"%a, %d %b %G %T -0700"`

So now Outlook will print (rather imperiously) "Install Linux by 11:00 Thursday".

Okay, one more followup. I did some pokin' around on the web and found that
there's a program called rpmu which appears to do all the install stuff I
need. And it works - no segfaults. So, I'm thinkin' there's something hokey
with the rpm files or libraries or something. I really don't know.

Now, of course, the fun part is finding all the dependencies packages. And
there's quite a few of 'em.

Thanks to everyone for your suggestions and help.

Have you checked the menus in the printer?  Could be the default paper
size has been set to A4.

BTW, the main advantage to using the IIp driver over the Series II driver
is that the IIp supports data compression.  Mainly affects print speed.

  OO.o can be a major PITA to configure properly and consistently. As root
you need to run spdadmin to set up the printers. You also need to define the
layout you want -- including page size and margins -- and save that as the
default. I find all this to be rather ugly and a bother each time I upgrade,
but that's the price to be paid for slavishly following Microsoft.

I'm wondering what percentage of Outlook users will heed your

their black list.

No offense taken, Ed. I always don my asbestos undies before sitting down at
the computer :-)

I take care to use the heading only from my personal account - never in the
office. That's where most LookOut users with whom I might communicate are
located. I suspect that LookOut lusers outside of work who are sufficiently
clued to know how to deep six me would also understand the good natured
ribbing. Those lacking clues probably won't even notice.

Eric recommended the -K option which is the same as checksig.  From the
man page:

      rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
           PACKAGE_FILE ...

       The  --checksig  option checks all the digests and signatures contained
       in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity and origin of the package. Note
       that  signatures  are  now  verified  whenever  a  package is read, and
       --checksig is useful to verify all of the digests and signatures  asso-
       ciated with a package.

       Digital  signatures  cannot be verified without a public key.  An ascii
       armored public key can be added to the rpm database using --import.  An
       imported  public key is carried in a header, and key ring management is
       performed exactly like package management. For example,  all  currently
       imported public keys can be displayed by:


Now I am not sure if the internals to know if this really works, i.e. it
checks every file, or if it checks a sig to the whole cpio....

Actually you can do as this as a user, and it saves the files as a user
(in ~/OpenOffice.xxx)

A lot of these values can be copied, but the pattern does not take long
for me.  OpenOffice has a better understanding of the printers than
merely "lp" so you have to set it up.  The abstraction layer of lpr
prevents apps from being able to tweak a printer (like margin, fonts,
etc.)  In windows this is done somewhat automatically since the printer
driver is evident in the local OS.

Just had an interview with a company that wants

Can anyone recommend an open source program and

They are not an open source shop but I'd like to
at least start bringing it up <grin>.

  Sandy didn't post the original article, Ed. :-)

  I read here about that trick so my custom header for Lookout! users is:
X-message-flag: Sent virus-free from a linux system.

  Can't afford to tick off clients, after all.

  It's the lack of rain. Natives dry out in the summer and get testy because
there's too much sunlight.

Nice touch, Rich. I've just refined my X-message-flag, but it still has

Careful about doing cost arguments without adjusting for inflation.
Some technological change that is not dependent on integration would
make it cheaper to produce boards that are non integrated likes the
ones in the 386 days...

My problem is this:

    The quality of PC computers is arguably as bas as it was before the 386.

    With the 386 a number of standardizations from the IDE hard drive
    controller to a standard expansion bus speed to a true 32 bit 
    architecture made matters better than they had been.

    Today as much as you might be told about modern Intel machines is that
    they are 386's on steroids.  If all the changes since the 386 were truly
    transparent we wouldn't be talking about cleaning up the PC as much as
    we are these days.

    Who offers a fool proof service to assist in choosing motherboards
    and other PC parts that will be 100% under Linux even under proper
    QC tests at a price that the general public can even consider?

    Integration forces you to choose a lot of parts at once which makes
    purchasing a motherboard a difficult business.  With Linux, being
    able to ignore bios and the fact that chipsets are being modified 
    in arcane and mysterious ways for onboard devices, incompatible
    devices can very easily mean that your toast.

    It's not like the old days where pulling a card out meant for sure 
    that it was gone where the chipsets were fairly standard.

    My frustration with Intel is this:

          1) An attitude of zero responsibility for labeling products
             that are poorly tested or have experimental parts on them.

          2) An attitude about IP that the information to produce a 
             suitable Linux driver for one of their products whether
             integrated or not is solely the property of Intel even
             when Intel fails to produce that suitable driver.

          3) A proprosed opinion that it is absurd and impossible to
             write drivers for Linux systems because of the number of
             distributions, kernels, etc...

I proprose Intel addresses the above problems in one to four ways:

          a)  Release the blue prints for components that are not well
              supported under Linux to the public.

          b)  Do a release to third parties under nondisclosure
              agreement that can be expected to produce the
              drivers that Intel itself either can't or won't.

          c)  Just label products better so that it's easier to find
              the ones that won't work well for a particular purpose
              including Linux use.

          d)  Require Engineers designing Intel products to familiarize
              themselves better with Linux.

As far as the absurdity opinion on writing drivers, what's wrong with
taking the current standard kernel as a base and working from there?
After all, who cares if there are multiple kernel branches so long
as companies make a good faith effort to stay within the kernel's
important structures and critical Linux architectural boundaries?
I thought API's among other things are supposed to make it possible
for various players to work independently of one another to develop
on the same platform.  Linux has documentation on how to add drivers
to the kernel properly, if a novice can find this why can't Intel?

I just think that the users will report it as an problem.  They are
annoyed and don't want to deal with it.  They will tell their sysadmins
who will see the stupid message and also get annoyed.  Then if they are
cleaver and feel like having fun will just remove your header and replace
it with theirs.  Or if they want to make it easier just block the address
so the users can't complain.  Either case it has the potential to be a big
waste of production to many people, even if it is funny.

Oh well.  I don't care.  Tell them to install OS2 or get an APPLE or
whatever you like.  I'm sure the next version of KDE mail will read the
headers and display them like MS does anyhow.  Then everyone will be
confused.  :-)

Actually relative to other chipsets, Intel has a reputation for
stability and compatibility.

Realize Intel's primary chipset customers are vendors like Dell, HP, and
Gateway, few of which plan on shipping linux desktop systems. Intel is

them.

Message-ID: <200307252004.AA66781388@opusnet.com>

I'm trying to set up a netbootable msclient 3.0 dos 6.2 image on my Linux box
for an asus P5S-VM machine that has an Fa311 card in it.  Updating fa311.dos fixed
it so that it would finish booting...  however, the pop up still crashes.  This is
the only computer I have that does this and I've pulled everything thinking a
card might be causing this...  It has to be the built in video.  Is there a trick
with emm386 or something to map the video cards memory or is this something else?

Well, at the very least the net use commands now work on that machine.  I have a 
secondary network set up with a dedicated samba server to distributed 98SE's
cab files from.  The pop up is the equivalent of network neighborhood under 98SE
and is very convenient, when it works.

This is limited to 8.3 filenames but it's a nice stand in until I get a netbootable
to ramdisk Linux system working.

Actually the board has a phoenix bios and is an HP OEM product out of a builders
lot of 50 or so of these.  The board revision is 1.01 if that's a clue at all.

Linux can run on a playstation II of all things.  It is very popular.
Intel is creating a chicken and the egg situation.  If Intel doesn't
rate it's products for Linux people are afraid to switch.  The problem
with Gateway, Dell, etc. are that these companies tend to produce
proprietary systems that can only use the operating system they
provide, or at least these companies seem to be trying to accomplish 
that.  The trouble with Microsoft software is the proprosition that 
you have an alternative where you need to pay Microsoft a lot
of cash for no support to use Windows.

What kind of alternative is there if the only way for Linux to run 
on some Intel hardware is for a hacker to reverse engineer it?  
Someone can and likely will do this, however, by the time it happens 
Windows may have unfairly win as "best" choice and the myth that 
noone wants to use Linux for their workstation purposes is 
perpetuated to another generation of Intel PC's.

Intel is lying if it says it can't provide a full featured alsa
driver for the D845PEBT2 under Linux where the card reportedly works 
under XP without a hitch.  The only reason to integrate an alsa 
instead of a Linux supported alternative such as a soundblaster 
live that I can see is to give Windows XP an unfair advantage
over Linux.

There needs to be a law to support people who want to build Linux
systems in a market controlled by Dell, Gateway, Compaq...  These 
companies have sealed up the reality of Intel for Windows only for 
years.  All I would hope for is priviledged access to hardware blue 
prints for a company that builds Linux based workstation PC's.  
Otherwise, I hope Intel takes their alsa driver for Linux to a 
truly functional level addressing whatever seg fault issues they
have run into and increasing the number of channels supported 
to all eight instead of just two.

How can the public tell Intel they want solid Linux compatibility
information on Intel products?  I bet you a million bucks the plug
list could generate a ton of original requests for Intel to adjust 
business practices and better support Linux if information on where
to send those requests were provided.  If Intel is truly committed
to finding out if people wabt to switch to Linux and potentially
support that fully why aren't there questionnares about Linux 
interest on Intel's web site or with newly purchased Intel products?

Anyone who believes there isn't pursueable interest in Linux on the
desktop hasn't paid enough attention to this list nor have they
paid enough attention to Linux in general.

If Intel officially claims that people want XP instead of Linux,
regardless of public sentiment, the only choice the public is
going to have is to abandon Intel entirely where the goal is
to build a Linux workstation.  I have with the system I'm 
building now which is an Athlon.

Maynard and Beatte, two Intel employees, are plenty smart enough
to figure out how to develop hardware with Linux compatibility
in mind.

Subject: [PLUG] Skutch AS-4 verses a more expensive...
Message-ID: <200307260651.AA232915072@opusnet.com>

telephone line simulator.  Is the AS-4 sufficient for setting up a test
between a Linux dial-up server and some dial-up client?  The ad says you
have to play with a ringer switch to make it work.  I'm asking to determine
whether or not I should really try to win an auction for one or if I should
let it go because it won't do the trick.  The AS-4 is a LOT cheaper than
alternative single line telephone simulators like the TLS-3 or TLS-4.  
I just want to play with setting up a dial up server using an old 386 
I have for the server side and anoher old machine for a client.

The other simulators on E-Bay all appear to cost more than $100.  For 
that kind of money I might as well pay for two more normal phone lines 
for a month to two.   In Scappoose two months even for two lines 
out of pocket including $40 hookup fee, don't know about extended 
area service, will probably cost as much or less than a single 
TLS-3 or TLS-4 simulator. 

The nice thing about the AS-4 is that it costs about as much as a local 
service line, assuming the auction will go for between $25 to $40, for 
a single month minus the $40 hookup fee.  The advantage of a simulator 
is no time limit on using it and you're not too far apart in a situation
where you block a partners only phone line.

If a more expensive simulator is what's needed to test a dial-up
server without using local phonelines I can always save for one 
long term.

Come to think of it, I think a lot of the cell phones have dial-up
service through a built-in modem.  Problem with cell phones is that
there is no such thing as a local service area where you usually buy
one for cheap long distance or roadside emergencies.

I wonder if it is necessary with the AS-4 to use the ringer or if
you just have to pick up on both ends of the simulator simultaneously
to have a connection.  For a modem test it should be possible to work
without a ringer.

Subject: [PLUG] Optional programmable roms...
Message-ID: <200307260803.AA114688210@opusnet.com>

Does anyone know where to get an extended rom card?  My fa311 doesn't have a bootrom
socket where the fa312 is so expensive it doesn't seem worth it.  I wonder if PXE
can be installed into the flash ram of a FIC VA503+, ASUS P5S-VM, or ASUS P5A-B
with the bios?

The etherboot documentation talks about an ISA card you can build with a EPROM
on it to program PXE or etherboot into, I wonder if anyone sells such a card?  
How about a PCI version?  Many machines have open expansion slots, I'm surprised
bootprom sockets weren't succeeded by an extra card a long time ago since a lot
of nics no longer have the socket and it's often difficult to get the right EPROM
or EEPROM.  I guess 32k and 64k NVRAM used in cell phones isn't that expensive
anymore.

A rom card depending on how much memory it has is useful for more than just
setting up PXE where the onboard nic won't take a boot chip.  It is also
interesting for turning say an old pentium into a switch via an embedded 
Linux system.  A more practical use may be to build a Linux tape server 
in a rom.  A firewall appliance also comes to mind.

Using a disk drive to start etherboot or pxe is a royal pain even with xosl
making it easier to get to say a local Linux or Windows system without
having to eject the etherboot floppy all the time.  Unless you don't use
the floppy drive it's easy to lose the netbooting disk.

The other option I suppose is to install two 1.44 meg floppy drives so that
the etherboot disk never has to be taken out.  I guess the smart move would
be to program xosl to boot drive b and call the selection etherboot. 

Will etherboot fit on a 1.2 meg disk?  Does anyone make 5.25" inch floppies
anymore?  I need some low density 5.25" disks for my color computer where 
some of our newer computers have a 5.25" inch drive.  I'm uncertain if you 
can add a third disk drive to the standard onboard floppy controller on 
most motherboards let alone if xosl can boot to a third floppy drive.

Steve, et al.:

  The pcnet_cs module is in /etc/rc.d/rc.pcmcia. The process, /sbin/cardmgr,
is in the list waiting to be run. 'lsmod' shows pcmcia_core is loaded.
'find' doesn't find pcnet_cs.

  I seem to be stuck in a deep rut here. If pcnet_cs is listed in
/etc/rc.d/rc.pcmcia, shouldn't it be loaded if a card requiring that module
is in the slot? I did try '/etc/rc.d/rc.pcmcia stop' followed by 'start'
with no different results.

  When I read 'dmesg' I see that the card is properly detected, then
cardservices are unloaded:

Look for  pcnet_cs.o.  You might look at /etc/modules.conf and see if
any alias statement refers to that module.  Should be in
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/net/

Does the alias line for pcmcia (in /etc/modules.conf) have an option
entry line associated with it? You might add one with the option cardbus
if it doesn't already exist. Also, in prior years there were issues with
pcmcia in laptops not keeping up with the specification as quickly as
the cards were. Take a look at the BIOS revision of the laptop and make
sure it supports the cardbus revision of the NIC that your using.

Ken,

  /etc/modules.conf is empty.

  In /lib/modules/2.4.20/kernel/drivers/net/pcmcia/ is pcnet_cd.o.gz. I
assume that I need to unzip this and place it ... where?
/etc/rc.d/rc.modules contains a list of potential modules to load. If I
place a reference to the gzipped file in rc.modules will the kernel
automatically uncompress it?

  I'm in virgin territory here.

Thanks,

Rich

I had a harddisk failure this morning that boogered the root directory

Where can I get the syntax for this file?  Securing and Optimizing Redhat
Linux the Ultimate Edition suggests rewriting this file entirely, however,
those instructions are for sendmail-8.11.4.  I had no trouble changing the
smrsh path and I caught on to the C syntax error it pointed out though I
don't get what this particular file has in it and whether or not I really
want to change it.  This is expecially true considering that the file says
not to change it and has lines I don't understand yet.

I have the O'Reilly book Sendmail, 2nd edition.  Unfortunately it was
written when 8.8.xx came out where this directory evidently didn't even 
exist then.

Other than the binmail users are there other special users that are needed
for security reasons and when should I create the accounts in the compile
process?

I'm running RedHat 9.
If you install a subset of the software packages on the CD's,
how do you subsequently add some of the remaining packages.

For example, if you did not choose the web server option during the
initial install, how would you install it from the CD's at a later
time?

The RedHat manuals don't seem to cover this...

Are you sure of that model number? According to netgear.com, it does not 
exist. 

At any rate, to find the chipset, run lspci. Do lspci -v for more details. 
Then you can find the correct driver. Chipsets are more meaningful than model 
numbers, as hardware manufacturers like to mix n match, and not bother to 
tell us. After all, us non-Winduhs customers don't count.

After having a nice time talking to the neighbors at the summer block
party, the answer gradually came to me: dpkg --get-selections and dpkg
--set-selections < foo.  I don't immediately see a way to force a
particular (the old) status file (except to temporarily copy it into
the right location) and then move the real one back.  Then I needed to
run dselect or aptitude afterwards to actually install the
selections.  Seems to be working!

Hmm... It's unlike Rich to make a mistake on the model numbers...

OH, I see the problem Carla!  You should have been looking at netgeat.com.

Pretty sure that both of them blackhole my messages anyway,

Not sure what the file was named, but K3b does now find

Carla,

  The instruction sheet is for the FA-330 and FA-331. The end flap on the
box reads FA-331.

  Thank you. When I switched to linux I learned to use my fingers and toes

Weird,  www.netgear.com doesn't list this critter under products or 
support.  Google seems to only reference a German helicopter.

Maybe you've got a NIC that wasn't?

I've heard of mouse issues with some of the cheaper KVM's. I don't like 
the low Dlink ones.  It appears the firmware doesn't provide a method for 
disabling the annoying screen identifier.  The high end stuff, Avocent 
(formerly Cybex) and Blackbox all seem to work well.

I have a Cybex 4-port SwitchView, that works mostly.  Doesn't work with 
Toshiba laptop, though--I either get mouse or keyboard control, but not 
both.  Another time, it stopped responding to the hot-key sequence 
<ctrl><ctrl> which required hitting the select button on the front.  It 
seems to be working again.

Have used the more professional Commander which worked flawlessly, but at 
$600 it was not for home use.

If your machines use USB, make sure your KVM can.  As Robby just mentioned 
Synergy, which may work for you, note from the FAQ:

	# Can synergy share the display in addition to the mouse and 			keyboard?

	No. Synergy is a KM solution not a KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) 		solution. 
However, future versions will probably support KVM. 			Hopefully, this will 
make synergy suitable for managing large 			numbers of headless servers.

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

  Thanks, Robby. This shares keyboard and rodent but each machine requires
its own monitor. I don't have the room for that, either.

The best ones I have used so far are the el cheapo from Fry.  The boxes
say "ICS" And as best I can see it is Intelligent Computer Switch.  The
16 port ones are called Maestro I think.  It passed the all important
"Can I boot NT and still get a mouse working without watching the
frickin' NT boot screens?" test.  Linksys and several others did not
pass this test.  Mine is about 4 years old.

The only issue is that scroll mice do not work through them (under
linux).  This is *now* a showstopper for me.

This is the 4 port version.  The things I like:  Talks to AT or PS/2
keyboards, talks to ps/2 or serial mice ports (requires PS/2 mouse). 
Cables are standard cables, albeit gender bendering odd, the GQ cheap
cables work great, this can save a bundle.

If I had to but another one I would look for one that accepts USB
keyboards and mice.  Cutting a cable out is awesome, esp when the new
cable is standard.  This is one of the best uses of USB I have ever
seen.

The cost of 2 v 4 is minimal, so I would go with 4.  This would allow
you to put your laptop on there as well.

Things I would avoid:  Physical switches.  They tend to break.  They are
cheap though.  I have one for 6 years, and a few paper weights.

Some other things:

When buying the cables.  Take the box and the cables over to a PC and
open them and test them.  Whenever I fail to do this I get some gender
wrong.  I have a bag full of incorrect cables, some exactly like the
others I previously mis-bought.  Getting gender, length and pin type is
tricky.  Also check every package.  The packages get mixed on the
shelves, and when you buy 30 cables, getting a M-M HD15 bag (or a
couple) instead of VGA pin outs, sucks.  Each time, it sucks more.

When you are done, twist tie or cable tie the cables.  Then *label*
them, esp mouse vs keyboard.

  Thanks, Zot. I want to run two linux boxes (RH 7.3 and Slack 9.0) for a
while; not permanently.

  When I googled for information I saw most models are three pairs of cables
with a single connector on the other end. I suppose the monitor, keyboard
and mouse plug into the big connector, then the two (that's what I was
looking for) pairs of connectors go to each machine.

  Your setup looks much more complex.

Steve,

  I've not yet fired up the box; just put it together yesterday. My FA-310
cards use the tulip driver and I'm trying to find out about the 331.
According to Ed's post, Slackware-9.0 does not have a good implementation of
the tulip driver. Or, something else that causes problems.

  After fighting for several days with a Zonet pcmcia NIC, I just want stuff
that works. What I "save" on product purchase I lose many times over in
futzing with the machine trying to get it to work.

Ummm, well I found this linux to a zip archive of drivers.

http://www.station-drivers.com/page/reseaux.htm


Inspecting the zip file there is a directory for linux driver and lists 
entries for for redhat 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, and 7.0.  Which would lead me to 
believe that is an obsolete card.  Looks like you might have to compile 
your own driver for it.

  I'm taking the Zonet back to ENU tomorrow; too much time spent trying to
get it running. Same problem with the LinkSys. When I insert the 3com card I
use in my notebook, it instantly works.

  So, my question to you folks is what card should I get for fast ethernet

I took a look at the link that Josh sent and I do see a driver for the
FA330/FA331 on the list (under the drivers section about 13 down). It
looks like a .zip archive so there's a good chance that it's the windows
driver. Take a look at getting the latest tulip and giving it a shot.

  Good point. I can take the new box to the dining room, hook up a monitor
and keyboard there and install the OS separately. Then I can see if there's
any hassle getting it connected to the network. Once that works, what I want
to do is copy all of /usr/local /usr1 and /opt to the new box.

  My plan is to copy off everything that's not kernel/GNU tool-specific.
Then, when I'm comfortable that everything on the old box is up and running
on the new one, I can shut down the old one, transplant the SCSI adapter,
cd-rw and tape drive to the new box, boot the new one and expect to have it
all run perfectly.

  I thought it easier to do the transfers using a kvm setup, but I can tar
an entire file system and move it across via scp. Thank you for pointing out
the obvious to me.

  Because I use the soon-to-be-replaced box as my main server/workstation in
a production environment (i.e., my business), I want to make the transfer
error-free, quick, reliable and easy. If I've missed something in my
strategy, please let me know.

Unless you want to save an archival copy, there isn't any good reason
to tar to a file.  Instead you can do the tar-to-tar trick (check the
archives) or use rsync.

Rich,

I've used Linksys (two different models), Cybex, BlackBox, Raritan (2 or
3 different models.)

I recommend avoiding unpowered KVMs at all costs.  In my experience,
unpowered KVMs of all brands are less stable then the powered KVMs.

My two cents.  Hope that helps.
Erik.

  Thanks, Russell. I need to read up on rsync as I believe that's the tool.
For archival purposes I have the tape backups.

Where I'm currently working, we use a fair number of KVM boxes made by
Cybex & others connected to flat screen monitors. Which combination has
produced an interesting problem:

Take machine connected to a KVM box, boot from either a RedHat install
CD or a Knoppix CD, & watch the system go thru the usual messages as the
OS starts. Until the booting comes to starting the X server, when an
error message stating that the server can't start, at which point everything
shuts down.

I've seen it twice, & both times pulling the KVM out of the setup solves
the problem. I admit I haven't researched this issue (except to suspect it
lies with some bug in XFree, rather than either distro or the window
manager), but it *is* something to be aware of.

And, no, Windows in the same hardware configuration has no problems.

I'm not fishing for a solution for this problem, but would be happy to
help in troubleshooting this odd problem.

Rich,

Here is the simple command I use to backup on the same machine.

rsync --archive --verbose /etc /drive2/backup

That backs up the /etc dir to my second drive in the same machine.  But I
use the same command across SSH.

  Well! I just learned a useful lesson. The Zonet pcmcia card I bought is a

worked because it's 16-bits. I just ordered another 3Com and it will be here

Did some looking (I like detective work.)  FA331 appears to be an OEM
version of the FA311; from the signs and portents, I'm guessing the FA330
is the low-profile version.

The one FA331 driver I found was for some sort of National chipset.  The
FA311 is based on the DP83815, which uses Linux's "natsemi" driver.

I'd guess the second; recent kernels have decent Tulip drivers IIRC.

Ayuh.  Even if you have the particular skillset available, it's rarely
worth it.  At my last job, I couldn't believe how much time and hassle it
cost us when a vendor changed network or SCSI boards on us.

Since hardware expert was one of the hats I wore, I put a lot of effort
into vetting purchase orders--at least until Purchasing got tired of
having an extra, cantankerous link in the chain.  After that, I had to
support whatever came in, which was much less hassle for them. ;)

                -----------------------------------

So, in other words, use the "natsemi" driver.

BTW, it *really* helps if you provide info on the big chip(s) on the
board and/or lspci output.

Yes, there's a difference between "PCMCIA" and "PC Card" slots, being 16
and 32, respectively.  PC Card slots are backwards compatible, AFAICT,
with PCMCIA.

The advantage to your method is only the changed files are copied, while
the disadvantage is there is no compression?

  That's what I'll try; someone else suggested it, too.

  I've avoided hardware issues the past decade. I really don't have either
the interest or the time.

  Had I looked at it closely before installing it, I would have. And, until

I'm surprised there was no [PLUG] for VNC.  It will do everything the

  I should mention that I searched the knowledge base on www.opera.com and
the checkbox to enable javascript in File | Preferences | Multimedia
|Plug-ins is checked. So, it should work, but it doesn't. And, checking the
box to report javascript errors makes no difference.

Except it won't let you get into the BIOS or boot loader.

I think a firmware-based serial console would give access to the BIOS
and boot loader, but normal home PCs don't have this so the serial
console has to be started by lilo or grub, and the BIOS is still
inaccessible...

That's certainly possible, but serial consoles only come stock on
embedded boards and server boards.

This is true, however these don't need to be accessed, once the system

Greetings:

I am running Mandrake 9.0

Trying to get an IOmega external zip drive to work again.
It USED to work, but no longer does.
I USED to mount it with the command mount mnt/zip1/
(returns guff*) then mount mnt/zip/

and I could use the drive. When this didn't work, I was told to try
rmmod usb-storage
modprobe usb-storage

and that was cool, because it worked.

Then it stopped working.

I had a Linux consultant come over, and after THREE & A HALF HOURS,
he had the following comments:

- Having problem accessing zip250 usb drive.
- System finds drive in /proc/bus/usb
- Raw contents exist at /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/disc
- /log/messages finds drive at /dev/sda
- attempting to mount drive returns "too many file systems open" or
"not a block device" errors
- Downloaded iomega tool (iw) and it returns similar errors
- I can't find anything obviously wrong, but can't mount drive....

Any other hints?

I don't have a ZIP drive, so I can't offer advice based on experience.

This is good, any partition information?

Was fdisk able to display any partition information on /dev/sda?

What exactly did you try to mount? I believe that the stock formated zip
drives mount as /dev/sda4, even though there is only one partition.

The drive may have lost its partition table, think of it more as a funny
hard drive, than as a funny floppy drive; it has to have at least one
partition for it to be accessed correctly.  Why the manufacturer choose
to have the one partition read as partition 4 is beyond me.  IIRC, both
Winblowz and Linux don't care what the partition number is, so you
should be able to set it to the first partition without any problems.

Removing and adding back the user probably equates to changing the UID
for that user. Check the permissions on the effected users home and/or
mail directory and make sure that the user in question still owns it.
When you recreate users you should use the -u option in useradd to make
sure that the UID remains the same for the new user.

Ever tried to configure the BIOs on an X86 system headless?

This is one area that Sun got right. You can access everything via
serial console, including NRAM settings.

Watching this debate with interest and first time I've seen my concerns 
asked.  The remote management/use of a host beit VNC, ssh, X, and others 
(which I all use) doesn't address the issue of booting the pc.  Most 
bios's I'm aware don't support operation without a keyboard and stop the 
boot process if one is not found.  Yes, there are some but they seem to  
be the exception.  An item like a "keyboard loopback plug" seem to 
non-existent.  


I agree, Sun got right. OpenBoot is a nifty environment.  I've heard some 
rumblings about using Linux as a base for smart bios, serial interface 
included.  Hmmm, I'll have to search for that again.

The upshod is that most Intel computers require a keyboard to boot 
successfully.  A KVM alleviates a cacophony of keyboards in a small area.

If you go into many modern bios you can tell it not to halt of any errors.
 The keyboard and mouse are considered errors.  Just tell it not to halt
on Keyboard error.  I have a headless/mouseless/keyboardless linux box
that I use and remote boot all the time.  I just had to tell the bios not
to halt on errors.

Still can't play with the bios settings and boot stuff but usually don't
need that.

Has anybody used a Serverworks chipset MB?  I've never seen one (I've
never had the need for a serial console either, I leave the serious
sysadmin stuff to others) but I've heard they do a decent job of a
serial console.

It occurred to me that this would be very useful.
Has anybody seen anything like an embedded sketch program built into
a wiki? Sort of a paper napkin blueprint tool? Ideally it would let
you save the sketch to the wiki page. A bonus would be the ability to
choose from some patterns to 'stamp' onto the drawing, for instance,
some simple network symbols.
I've been looking around and I've found some simple Java and
Javascript programs that are close, so I figure someone must have
done this already.

phpwiki has some support for some graphics libraries.  Basically you can
write code to a plug in.

I thought I some some whiteboarding, but I couldn't use it (its been

  It wasn't always this way. The initial motherboard and Pentium/100 I used
on my floppyfw box would reboot without keyboard or monitor. When that
failed -- after only seven months on the job -- I had to replace it with a
different board/CPU because the (local) vendor no longer carried the
original brand (so much for warranties). Anyway, the new one requires both
keyboard and monitor just ro complete booting.

"fdisk -l /dev/sda", as root.  This lists the partitions on /dev/sda.

You may find this background information helpful to understand what's

Only if the motherboard maker paid for the feature.  F'r instance, the
ASUS CUR-DLS used in the VA1220s didn't come with it, but the
near-identical CUR-DLSR did.  IIRC it was more-or-less possible to do BIOS
setup, but the Mylex cards used an Alt- sequence to go into RAID setup,
which didn't work via serial console.

It may seem like a funny thing to skimp on, but these guys are dealing
with teeny, tiny margins.

Dell's serial console support on the PE2650s is pretty nice, but it only
works at 9600 baud.  I was pretty impressed with SuperMicro's serial
console redirect, but it didn't support 38400 baud, which is what we used.


Wish they'd just used OpenFirmware,

Message-ID: <20030729180248.GA28596@eel.ENGR.ORST.EDU>

Under Mutt I'd like to include with each message I send to a list a
Reply-To directing responses back to the list. For example, I would
specify a certain set of lists: 

user at debian.org
lkml at linux.com
foo-users at bar.com

and every message I post to lkml would contain "Reply-To:
lkml at linux.com". 

Under pine I would use "Roles" for this; what is the equivalent feature
under Mutt?

Thx!

Tyler

PS. On lists that don't use Reply-To munging, message responses are
frequently addressed (by accident or design) both to the original poster
and the list. With Mutt, this behavior is controlled via the Followup-To
header, which works well assuming everyone uses Mutt. And in general duplicate
messages are handled trivially under procmail. I'm just curious about trying this...

Message-ID: <20030729195709.GA29823@eel.ENGR.ORST.EDU>

Hi everyone -
  
The Portland Area .NET User's Group (PADNUG) is meeting this Thursday,
7/31. Anyone with an interest in .NET or Mono programming is welcome to
attend, although (warning!) most participants come from a windows
background.
 
Networking and free pizza starts at 6:00pm. The meeting begins at 6:30
with group announcements, immediately followed by the featured
speaker's presentation. This month's presentation is on user interface 
design under the .NET framework, hosted by Phil Weber.
 
PADNUG meetings are free and open to the public. For more information
on future meetings and joining the PADNUG mailing list see
http://www.padnug.org.
  
  Presentation:   Create Great .NET User Interfaces
  Time:           6:30pm, 7/31/2003
  Place:          Step Technology 6915 SW Macadam, Suite 200, Portland OR
  Directions: http://www.steptech.com/aboutus/map.asp?navarea=contactus

  Description:

  Even the most beautifully coded application will flop if people hate
  to use it. And they will, if its user interface is not designed with
  their goals in mind. What makes a great UI? How can you apply the
  principles that work so well for the guts of an application to its
  front end?

  We'll show you specific techniques (with code!) that you can use
  immediately to reduce complexity for your users and improve your
  presentation layer's efficiency and maintainability."

Didn't try fdisk.  The partition info seems to be intact since it was
possible to access the drive using vmware/win2k.  This also indicates
that the hardware and disk are working and properly formatted.

I did trying mounting both sda and sda4.  I fact, since I've gotten
tricked by similar situations with other media, I tried mounting all
possible variations - sda1, sda2, sda3, sda4, sda5, etc.  All returned
"not a block device" errors except sda, which returned "too many open
file systems or bad superblock" errors.

OK, I've googled, and looked in various other places. 

I have a fuji 2800z digital camera that works wonderfully, and I can
download pictures from it to my linux box, using the USB storage method.
What I want to do now is use it as a pc cam. It has this mode
internally, and under Windows, it works fine. However, I can find
nothing on the 'net concerning using a PC Cam under Linux. 

Does no one that uses Linux do this?

I don't know. I've never bothered with that, since I have a shell script
that downloads all the photos automagically renaming them to the date

I'm totally confused here.

What kind of hardware are you guys BUYING?

I think the only system I've EVER had that wouldn't boot without a
keyboard was a cheap ass Dell that I found in a dumpster and which I
tossed after a few months because of proprietary hardware issues across
the board.

I have many makes and models of motherboard from the past to the present
(OK, I haven't bought a NEW motherboard in just over a year) and they all
seem perfectly happy to boot headless.

I do have a friend whose mother's floppyfw box can't boot without a
keyboard, but it runs fine when the keyboard's unplugged, so she knows to
plug one in if she ever has to turn the thing off.  It's a hassle, but
I can't think of any other examples of that problem in the real world.

Firm-ware, O-pen firmware.
It's appropriate techno-lo-geeeeee...

(Does anyone else remember the Open Firmware song?)

Yeah, it's good stuff.  Apple's using it now, too, aren't they?

I also remember someone (the name coyote comes to mind) selling an ISA
card that would output just about any x86 bios to a serial port and then
the card acted as a regular serial card when booted.  Pretty nifty.  I
remember it being ungodly expensive.

But anyway, I'm totally shocked that anyone has this problem in the modern
age.  I have a KVM switch (a fancy digital NTI box that somehow ended up
at my house) but it's only attached to two machines out of the five or six
on my rack here.  I keep it so that I can switch to something when my
workstation isn't doing what it should and I really need to read mail or
something.  I'd recommend this brand to anyone that has heaps of money to
spare.  They're great, but not priced for the home.

So you want to punish the conscientous to accomodate the lazy?

If somebody does the RIGHT thing with their mail (i.e., uses the common
"reply to all" function of their MUA and edits the recipient list
appropriately), you're going to make it very hard for them to reply only
to you.

Educate, don't accomodate.

Subject: [PLUG] Creating XML records
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0307300814210.322@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I'm slowly moving my reference library database to XML. Even with emac's
tag completion capabilities it's a slow, painful process to set up the
complete set of tags for each book and journal article. It would be much
more efficient if I had a form with all tags present and I could repeatedly
fill in a blank copy for each record.

  The kludgy way of doing this is to create a file with all tags and
constantly import it for each record. There must be a better way but I've
not yet found it. I think the ideal solution would be a stylesheet with all
the tags to be filled in. Then, when I did a search on the indexed records,
each one could be displayed in its own little window.

  Does anyone know of something like this? If not, what sort of search
phrase would you suggest I use on google, sourceforge or freshmeat?

TIA,

Rich

Is your current database stored in a parseable format? If so, I'd
certainly be willing to hack up a quick perl script that'll do most of
the grunt work for you. Your intervention would only be necessary at
the final editing stage.

  Thanks, Paul. It is now in an ASCII text file, exported from the ol' DOS
standby, "InfoSelect". If dosemu worked for me on the 2.4 kernel I wouldn't
take the time to make any conversions. But, ... I've four separate databases
to convert eventually.

  I don't know off-hand how consistent records are. For example, one paper
can have a single author while another has a half-dozen authors. Books are
intermingled with scientific journal articles and agency reports. I'd be
fascinated to learn how a parsing language like perl or python could emulate
the intelligence to discern what each record represents, what tags to apply
and what to put in each tag.

  Let me get back with you on this. I'm trying to get a permit application
out before the end of tomorrow so that takes priority.

Gracias,

Rich

People with Master's degrees from reputable universities are having
trouble getting work at this point.  I honestly don't think that  a PCC
degree (or certificate or whatever it is) is going to help you at all in
this market (especially if you don't already have a good bit of software
engineering experience).  Things _might_ change in a couple of
years, however, I doubt it will ever be like it was in the late 90's when,
if you had a Community College certificate in Software Engineering you
could get several offers.... those days are gone forever.

I'd recommend that if you want to get into Software Engineering that you
be able to go without food for long periods of time and that you
have a tent to live in ... ;-)  Actually, if you _really_ want to get
into sofware engineering be aware that many of those jobs are going to be
outsourced to India or China in the next few years, so you have to find a
niche area that will be less likely to be outsourced.  My advice:
BioInformatics (Oh, they'll be able to outsource those jobs too, but it'll
take a bit longer before that starts).  OHSU/OGI apparently has a
BioInformatics program starting.

A list of files inside /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/ should show
the parts of the disk that devfs has found.  If devfs isn't creating the
symlinks, you may have to mount the partition in its long form, for
example:

mount -t vfat /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part4 /mnt/zip

But if it doesn't exist, it won't mount it.

I can handle an occasional email misspeling but could you refrain from
using TCP or IP communication program names in common references?

Latest hated jargon:  "I'll ping my boss after we are offline and see what
he has to say."

Ahhh!  I think the world is falling apart.

I used to work with a guy that had been in the US Navy submarine fleet and 
spent considerable time in subs.  We talked about this one and he thought 
that it had actually originated with sonar operators back in the '60s.  Up 
until then, I had always assumed that it came from the "ping" utility (and 
subsequent new verb meaning).

I guess when you're underwater for months at a time, you come up with some 
interesting things to think about.  The friend had some interesting phrases 
and sayings based on "ping" that I've never heard anywhere else.

Best,
Kyle

While that's the standard explanation, I prefer "The Story About Ping":

I always thought ping was a very apt analogy and the origin was obvious to
me.

You send out a ping and listen for it to come back.  The time it takes is
a good measure of the distance if you know what kind of connection you
have (density of the medium between you both) or a good measure of the
kind of connection you have if you know the distance.

With this in mind.  Then my boss is no where to be found as the 'ping' has
not returned.  :-(  Maybe I'll just break down and send an email.  Write a
letter and explain what I would like to do.  Then when no response I'll
know that it is all okay.

Hello Linux folkz,
I'm looking for a GPL or (worst case) commercial Web development
tool for Linux.
Practically I need to create XML or HTML templates with CSS
formatting.
Using vi takes too much time (typing each tag, copying and pasting).
I'd like to just click and draw tables and text areas.
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

I tend to stay away from WYSIWYG editors, though. If replication of code 
is your problem, look into CMS's instead.

This seems like a disadvantage of devfs (which I've never used, so please
take that as a "educate me" type comment).  That is to say, I've become
pretty accustomed to changing permissions and ownership on my devices to
suit the needs of the system.  How's that done in devfs?

Oh, and Guy... if there is a group that has rw permissions on the device
listed above (/dev/scsi...lun0/part4), then add the users that need to
mount and umount the sucker to that group.

Much of the streaming music on the Web is in .midi

not too familiar with the available software for it,
but have not succeeded in installing it, in any case.
Does anyone have recommendations?

Some audio cards do sequencing for you, but if yours (or its currently
available drivers) doesn't, then you can use Timidity.  I got mine
from debian.  Not sure where the canonical site is.  What looks like
it (judging by google) appears to be off the air at the moment.

Automount is probably the way you want to go, that way anyone on the

Keith,

I just find it alarming that the world or business is using technical
words or programs to describe human actions. Before someone would have
said. "After the meeting I'll discuss this with my boss for her opinion"

Now "I'll ping my boss after we are offline"

Terminology like that bothers me.  Not really sure why but I guess to
makes them appear uneducated.  And this is from PhD's and otherwise
intelligent people

I dunno, cause I gave up on setting up IMP after I started getting
errors in PHP libraries, but may I suggest:

cd /path/to/imp/installation
egrep -r "myuser at localhost.mydomain.com" .

If that doesn't turn up anything, is it possible /etc/hosts has
localhost.mydomain.com in it? Then you could just search for myuser

in fact, I emend that to say

egrep -r "myuser" . | less

Why? It's more concise, it conveys the same message, and English is an 
evolving language.

My pet peeve is contractions that cause redundancy.

Such as the ever popular "You've got mail." When this "simple" sentance 
is expanded, you have "You have got mail". I was taught that this is 
improper. "You got mail" is also wrong. In addition, it just doesn't 
sound right if you say, "You've mail." So, my English Professor would 
have said that the proper form of this sentence would be, "You have mail".

But then I look at what I wrote you in response to your "bother". Why 
does this bother me? It still conveys the same message. English is an 
evolving language.

On and on and on and on.

Yada yada yada.

There are some bits of obsolete/obstinate equipment I am waiting to retire 
appropriately - using .50BMG. We might need a different sound effect word 
than 'plink,' given 12,191ft-lbm of energy per round.

Just remember the fax machine in the movie 'Office Space.'

True, English is an evolving language but the use of 'ping' to determine
distance in all prior cases makes more sense.  But to use it as a way to
say discuss, talk about, address, or consult makes no sense.  Maybe I'm
missing something.  As is the use of 'offline'.  I'm suppose to think I
was ever 'online'?  I was on the phone.  When did the phone conversation
constitute being online?

Anywho, just my pet pivs.  Ignore them.  I'm sure I do things that annoy
others.  Like write emails off topic. :-)    Or should I say.  "I'm sure
my pop-up ads, cause people to want to reboot".

My lesiure reading is taking me through a bunch of machinist's and jobb 
shopper's autobiographical anecdotes. The earliest use I saw of 'online' went 
back to the "line shaft." Mills of the 1880's, be they waterpower or steam, 
would often build in one or powered shaft running the length of the shop 
floor or assembly line. All the machines, such as drill presses, lathes, and 
trip hammers, drew their rotational power from leather belts leading down 
from pulleys mounted along the line shaft. 

Although I haven't seen 'off line' used for a machine stopped (such as for 
repair or adjustment) by throwing off its belt, I have seen 'on line' (two 
words) used for operating machines connected to the line shaft.

Nasty thing to remember was that safety glasses were seen as a wussy 
exception, and most people worked in collared shirts and ties around all 
these unguarded spindles and pinching hazards.
OSHA hadn't been invented yet...

You are correct in this, IMHO.

Well, to discuss something, at least in this context, is to find out how 
far away your idea is from mine. So the ping analogy holds.

I often throught of it as the sound. "I'll ping my boss." Could be 
throwing a lead pipe at him to hear the "PING!!!" as it bounces off his 
head... :) Of course, I have no way to measure the length of time it 
takes for the pipe to travel, or for the ping to return... But I'm going 
off the deep end again.

With a modem?

In my mind, a muddled place if there ever was one, "online" refers to 
any conversation, in person or not. While the conversation is ongoing, 
you are "online". I've heard (for years) when a topic goes down a 
rathole in a meeting, "We'll take this up offline." Referring to after 
the meeting.

Perfect. :)

Message-ID: <4.3.1.0.20030731105008.00b83228@www.hotsushi.com>

On July 24, 2003 Prof. Eden Moglen of Columbia Law School and General
Council of the Free Software Foundation, addressed OSDL's Linux User
Advisory Council. His presentation was an analysis of SCO's threat to
require end users to buy a license to use Linux. Prof. Moglen has
summarized his talk in a position paper that OSDL has published.
This paper can be found at the following link:

http://www.osdl.org/docs/osdl_eben_moglen_position_paper.pdf

This paper is entitled Questioning SCO: A Hard Look at Nebulous Claims.
It is designed to help readers understand the legal basis - or lack
thereof - of SCO's action. It also provides some questions they should
ask themselves and their legal council regarding the legal exposure
- or lack thereof -they face by continuing to use Linux. We think
you'll find this interesting reading.
Please pass this note along to anyone you believe should see it.
Thanks,
Tim

While you're educating it's good to accomodate.  Or as this story illustrates:

    
    I am reminded of the park ranger who was telling me the other day that
    essentially they way they solved the bear problem in Yellowstone was to give
    up on training humans to store food properly, and instead, work with the
    more easily trained bears to get them to avoid the humans.

Wxcept, haveing ben around since BEFORE TCP/IP, there is an alternate
derivation of "ping" which is one half on the pair "ping-pong"  in cases
where ICMP was not inplace one would write a pair of programs, ping and
pong, pong being a responder for ping.  This was usially (as is often
still the case) simply for testing conectivity.

Subject: [PLUG] The "mail" comand and searching the list archives.
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0307311747190.10786-100000@antares.mpcu.com>


I thought I saw on this list how to redirect the output of mail's message 
listing but can no longer find reference to it.

Example.  On a host that has the "mail" command, I run it as that user.  
Entering a "?" I get the following.

? ?
?               print this help message
#               display message number #
-               print previous
+               next (no delete)
! cmd           execute cmd
<CR>            next (no delete)
a               position at and read newly arrived mail
d [#]           delete message # (default current message)
dp              delete current message and print the next
dq              delete current message and exit
h a             display all headers
h d             display headers of letters scheduled for deletion
h [#]           display headers around # (default current message)
m user          mail (and delete) current message to user
n               next (no delete)
p               print (override any warnings of binary content)
P               override default 'brief' mode and display ALL header lines
q, ^D           quit
r [args]        reply to (and delete) current letter via mail [args]
s [files]       save (and delete) current message (default mbox)
u [#]           undelete message # (default current message)
w [files]       save (and delete) current message without header
x               exit without changing mail
y [files]       save (and delete) current message (default mbox)
? 


Then doing a header list "h a" I see there a 23 messages.  Reading 
message number 15, the message scrolls by rather quickly.  I thought I saw 
somebody post a sequence like this recently.

. | ! more

to pass the output from mail to a system command such as "more".  But I'll 
be dogged if'n if I can find the right voodoo to make it happens.  Google 
is being onery with me and not honoring quotes resulting hundreds of 
thousands of hits.



Next, is there a preferred method of searching this mail lists archive 
from some type of search engine?  The list archive web page seems to only 
provide access to the archive in web form but no way to specific searches.
