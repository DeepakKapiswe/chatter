Dale,

   That was it. I had not looked at the fonts assigned to each style.
Changing the default style font fixed the issue.

Thank you,

In LO you can record a macro for that action, then add it to (if I
recall correctly) the Auto-open script or macro so that every time you
open a certain type of document the default style is automatically
fixed.

I love the ability to record actions as macros. No manual coding
necessary. :)

For the seventh time I am attempting to install a program from source,
this time on my Fedora 16 x86_64 laptop. The previous six failed, and
so far this one is also going down in flames. However, I have not given
up and I even think I see what is wrong.

The program is Sleepyhead. I have instructions which a helpful fellow
is writing for Ubuntu users*, which I am occasionally translating for
the RPM world. 

I used git to collect the source and put it in ~/sleepyhead-code. Then
I installed (per the instructions) qt-devel, qtwebkit-devel and gcc-c++
which, it turns out, were already installed with the latest versions.
Then I ran qmake-qt4, which also exited without error. But when I then
ran make -j2 I got a list of errors, some of which are:

/usr/bin/ld: warning: libnvidia-tls.so.260.19.21, needed
by /usr/lib64/libGL.so, not found (try using -rpath or -rpath-link)
/usr/bin/ld: warning: libnvidia-glcore.so.260.19.21, needed
by /usr/lib64/libGL.so, not found (try using -rpath or -rpath-link)
/usr/lib64/libGL.so: undefined reference to `_nv007tls'
/usr/lib64/libGL.so: undefined reference to `_nv013glcore'
/usr/lib64/libGL.so: undefined reference to `_nv014glcore'
followed by another 18 lines like the last three.

Now, this computer started with only the nv driver when I originally
installed Fedora 11. During dist-upgrades the nv driver changed to the
nouveau driver. Later I installed (and still use) the nVidia proprietary
driver. At one time I tried going back to the nouveau driver, but
discovered that the proprietary driver had done some weird things with
links that I have been unable to undo. I gave up and just continue to
use the proprietary driver. So I think the above error messages are
related to that issue.

Unfortunately, my understanding of links is that 1) Linux people love
them and, 2) they are some kind of pointer and, 3) there are different
kinds. That's all I know. I could Google, and I don't mind learning
more about links, but I bet I still won't be able to fix the above
errors. I could use some pointers and suggestions for where to start.

John,

   The usual procedure for building and installing from source code has three
steps:

 	1. configure
 	2. make
 	3. make install
The last is run as root (or sudo).

   From your description it appears that you missed the configuration step.
This checks your system for required libraries and sets application paths.
You can see the avabilable options by typing (from within the source
directory),
 	./configure --help | less

HTH,

Rich

Running the above command from within the source directory
(sleepyhead-code) I got:

bash: ./configure: No such file or directory

The person I got the instructions from must have done a .configure,
because the instructions listed three packages that needed to be
installed. (I already had all three installed.) I don't know how he ran
the .configure command. It sure doesn't work for me.

Although Rich is correct about the configure command, i didn't see this
mentioned in any of the Sleepyhead install tutorials I came across.

However, I'm not sure why you're unnecessarily complicating the install
process by installing it from source when there is a x86_64 version and a
Fedora_x86 version available here.

These days, configure is part of the GNU Autotools package, which
provides a standard way of building your programs.  There are
other build tools out there, such as Ant, and CMake.  In this case,
the programmer(s) decided on QMake.  You don't need to (and
_cannot_) run configure.

That said, I think you have something mis-configured in your
system, John.  I just did a git clone of the sleepyhead sources,
and did the qmake-qt4 / make sequence.  It took a few minutes, but
sleepyhead compiled just fine.  I don't have any of the required
hardware to test with, but the program started with no errors, and
seems to function.  (Fedora 17, dual-core Athlon 64-bit system.)

qmake-qt4 is building the makefile so its does the job running configure
would do.

The missing libraries*  should be on your system though, as part of the
driver install, alt least they are on mine (though it's not a Fedora
box)  you might want to check they actually are.

* libnvidia-tls.so, libnvidia-glcore.so

I already have that one installed. In fact, it was I who created that
package by converting a debian package with alien and sending it to
the author. There also exists a package in the Fedora 18 repos that was
created in January. But I want the latest version, for which a package
exists at this time only for Windows. 

And besides, I need to practice more installing from source. :)

They seem to be on my system:

[jjj at Devil8 sleepyhead-code]$ locate libnvidia-tls.so
/usr/lib64/nvidia/libnvidia-tls.so.1

/usr/lib64/nvidia/libnvidia-glcore.so
/usr/lib64/nvidia/libnvidia-glcore.so.1
/usr/lib64/nvidia/libnvidia-glcore.so.304.64

Maybe I just need to make a link to them? Put the folders in my PATH?
Something else?

you need to see where the makefile is set up to look for them. then make
sure that they can be found there.

the makefile won't generally use the PATH.

SleepyHead (which I just built from source successfully) doesn't use a
gnu-autoconf build system, so Rich's suggestion won't help you here
(although it is generally sound advice).

I'm actually a bit amazed that SleepyHead built, honestly.

After installing the requisite dependencies (as documented, anyway) I did:

$ qmake
$ make

It may be relevant that I didn't use a -j flag for make, but I doubt that's
the problem.

The error that you posted initially seems to indicate that a shared library
is missing -- possibly due to removing some library / driver.  The
complaint is about libnvidia-tls.so.260.19.21, which seems to be referenced
by /usr/lib64/libGL.so

You need to fix this before it SleepyHead will compile.  The easiest way is
probably to reinstall whatever package provided /usr/lib64/libGL.so --
there's bound to be a yum / rpm command that will tell you that, but I
don't know those tools well enough.  (rpm -qa /usr/lib64/libGL.so  maybe?)

The nvidia installer usually fixes any problems like this.
Reinstalling it might fix the links.

Having poked a little bit more libGL.so is a part of the nvidia drive
package as well so its strange it can't find them. 

ldd /path/to/libGL.so should tell you where its looking for them.

# ldd /usr/lib64/libGL.so

will tell you if you need to reinstall the Nvidia package.  Nvidia
stomps on libGL.so (from the Mesa package).  You should see something
like this:

# ldd /usr/lib64/libGL.so
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff2b970000)
	libnvidia-tls.so.319.32 => /usr/lib64/tls/libnvidia-tls.so.319.32
(0x00007fcb5e287000)
	libnvidia-glcore.so.319.32 => /usr/lib64/libnvidia-glcore.so.319.32
(0x00007fcb5bd2f000)
	libX11.so.6 => /usr/lib64/libX11.so.6 (0x00007fcb5b9f7000)
	libXext.so.6 => /usr/lib64/libXext.so.6 (0x00007fcb5b7e6000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007fcb5b426000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fcb5b221000)
	libm.so.6 => /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007fcb5af26000)
	libxcb.so.1 => /usr/lib64/libxcb.so.1 (0x00007fcb5ad08000)
	libXau.so.6 => /usr/lib64/libXau.so.6 (0x00007fcb5ab04000)
	libXdmcp.so.6 => /usr/lib64/libXdmcp.so.6 (0x00007fcb5a8ff000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fcb5e7f2000)

Assuming, of course, that Fedora puts 32-bit libs in /usr/lib and 64-bit
libs in /usr/lib64

If libnvidia-{glcore | tls}.so.XXX.YY are missing (go look in
/usr/lib64) you will need to reinstall the Nvidia package, OR you can
uninstall Nvidia and reinstall nouveau-driver, Mesa and xorg-server
packages. That will restore all the F/OSS stuff.

Once you fix that, if you still get that "missing" error, compile with
something like:

# qmake-qt4 LIBS += -L/usr/lib64
# make -j2

(use the appropriate /usr/lib64 for your system and -j2 is just to speed
up compile on multicore/multithread systems so adjust as needed.)

As mentioned in prior posts, Sleepyhead uses Qmake (qmake-qt4 in Fedora)
and not the more venerable configure/make cycle.

For the future, to successfully build linux programs, you will need to
not only track down the dependencies, but also study up on the build
process each project uses (configure, cmake, qmake, etc).

I note that two were listed as 'not found' and two I have no equivalent
for and without the 'not found' message. I also have one that you did
not get:

	libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007fd968e21000)

I gather that the problem is caused by the two that ldd listed as 'not
found.' Before running the command I reinstalled the proprietary
driver, but that doesn't seem to have fixed anything.

I would love to remove the proprietary driver and go back to nouveau,
but I recall that when I tried to do that I couldn't get X to come up
at all due to missing parts. It was a long time ago and my recollection
is dim, but I think it had to do with misplaced links or files that
were not properly linked. Eventually I gave up and decided to live with
the proprietary driver. 

Right now I am going to reboot on the outside chance that reinstalling
the nvidia driver requires me to restart X before it will work
properly. I don't expect that to work, so then I will try once more to
remove the nvidia driver and go back to nouveau (which is still
installed). I may arrive at the meeting tonight with a computer that
won't boot. But worse things have happened to computers of mine. :)

Thanks for the detailed advice.

Yep, rebooting changed nothing. 

I knew that the nvidia driver needs the xorg.conf file that it creates
for itself upon installation. As far as I know, without the xorg.conf
file X will use the nouveau driver if it is installed (which it is). So
I renamed xorg.conf by appending today's date and rebooted. And X
failed to come up at all. No login window, just a hung black screen.
So I booted to runlevel 3, copied the xorg.conf.8.1.2013 file back as
xorg.conf and rebooted. I am back, but still with the nvidia driver. I
suspected that X would fail to come up with the nouveau driver as it
should. I don't know why, but it's time to get to the meeting. This
will have to wait.

John, it looks to me like you have pieces of two different
versions of the nVidia driver installed.  Earlier (Thu, 1 Aug 2013
13:29:49 -0700) you posted this:

Note the differences in version numbers compared to your other
post.  This kind of thing can cause all sorts of headaches, as
you've found.

You may be stuck with the nVidia driver.  The Fedora 16 repos are
gone, so you can't get the F16 version of nouveau and associated
X.org drivers/libraries. (Remember that the nVidia setup replaces
some of the standard packages.)  I'm told it possible to use
packages from later versions, but I don't know how it's done.

The nVidia software for F16 is still on RPMFusion.  I don't if
yum can get it or not.  If not, you'll have to do some manual
navigation (the repo isn't available directly from the web
interface) and download the relevant packages.  Then you can
install them with yum or rpm.  This thread

<http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=204752>

has the best instructions for installing nVidia on Fedora.  I've
followed these guides since F12, and they've worked beautifully.

Anyway, I hope this helps.

Dennis Gilbert (dennis at pdx.edu) opens the room for us, often before any of
the PLUG organizers get there.  I believe he's also the one behind the
magical PLUG signs that show up directing people to the room.  Usually you
don't have to worry about anything except being there; he's awesome and
rarely gets the recognition he deserves for such a consistent service over
the years!  Closing the space is just making sure the lights are out and
the doors are closed.

I recently discovered Leigh's post in the Fedora forums, and also my
old post. 

I've been putting of doing a dist-upgrade to Fedora 18, so that is next
on my list. Afterwards I'll revisit this mess. Oh, and I do still have
the nouveau driver installed. But things will be better after going to
Fedora 18.

Yes, you will need to resolve this. Looks like your libGL is from an
earlier nvidia version so it is not linked to the newer versions.

This is why I don't use any of them fancy pants repo distros. But that
is a personal preference / discussion for another time.

Since Nvidia stomps on quite a few files, AND blacklists the nouveau
driver (check in /etc/modprobe.d in most distros) you simply can't
switch willy nilly.

Your best option might be a CLEAN upgrade, not a dist-upgrade, to
restore the proper functionality.  Looks like 19 is out now.

Have fun!

Hi  guys,
I have a project to configure two SonicWall NSA1 4500 and NSA2 4500 HA in failover and high availability. I have two WANs from two different providers. In the past I configured SonicWall 2040 failover and I have assigned both WANs to two different interfaces and  setup the failover. In this project, I have two NSA and I get confused how to setup the failover. If someone has experience setting the failover and High Availability on SonicWall NSA 4500, please get back to me for help.
ThanksRaphael

Subject: [PLUG] To Hire a SysAdmin
Message-ID: <51FBFA17.5080908@gisnet.com>

Hi Everyone,

I'm looking for advice, salary surveys, requirements, etc.  for hiring a 
Systems Administrator for a new company I'm involved with. What we're 
planning to build is a business information service that supports our 
research analysts with information and infographics presentation tools. 
The database will be approximately 5 Tb, so it's big, but not 
unmanageable, and we're aiming to achieve facebook size numbers. Behind 
the curtain are a couple of built-from-scratch Linux servers optimized 
for reliability and network speed. Unfortunately, it seems that the only 
way I'll get the other founders to put a Linux workstation in their 
hands is if I can first  pry their cold, dead fingers off their Windows 
keyboards, so the new SA may be required to know something about Windows 
networks and security.

I've been doing this job for now, but mostly just the donkey work ( 
triage the logs, feed, groom, exercise, and sometimes muck out, etc. ) 
The stuff that goes beyond me I contract with a friend to keep the disk 
drives in the RAID10 all spinning in harmony like so many Nepalese 
prayer wheels. But he's got  a full-time job (the good ones aren't 
lacking for work these days) So he's available only at certain times.

This group seems to have a lot of experience with Linux system 
administration,and even though I'm in the Denver Metro Area you all seem 
to collectively have the broadest and deepest knowledge, so that's why 
I've come all this distance to the well ;-) I'm going to do some on-line 
searching, but I would appreciate any guidance so I don't get off on the 
wrong foot.

Thank you in advance!

Subject: [PLUG] False mailing list sign-ups
Message-ID: <51FCB1B9.70606@martinconsulting.com>

Can someone explain this to me?

I have a web-site where people can sign up to receive occasional 
e-mails.  When they sign up, my code sends an e-mail to the given 
address asking for confirmation.  Of course, if the e-mail address is 
invalid the confirmation bounces back to me as undeliverable.

It appears that some sort of bot is occasionally filling out the form 
with a bad e-mail address.  I get several bounces a week for what often 
look like outdated or made up addresses.  Here are a few of the errors I 
get back from the the relevant mail servers:

- Host or domain name not found.
- No route to host
- mailbox unavailable
- This user doesn't have a yahoo.com account

The site isn't very active and doesn't get many sign-ups at the moment.  
Pretty much all the sign-up activity is this sort of stuff.  It happens 
too often to just be a case of someone mistyping their e-mail address 
(twice) when they sign up.  I just retested the code using an external 
e-mail account, it works properly when given a valid e-mail address.

My question is --- what's the point?  Why is a bot interested in signing 
bad addresses (or any addresses, for that matter) up for a mailing 
list.  I certainly haven't hired anyone to promote the site.  Can anyone 
enlighten me as to the motivation behind this?

The bot isn't parsing your form to see that you'll send an email to verify the address.
It's just filling out the form and then, presumably, attempting further access on the site.

Brian,

   Have you considered using captcha' on your site? That requires a human to
copy obfuscated text to a text entry widget to validate the form has not
been filled in by a bot.

The ner-do-wells have figured a way around captcha'.  They divert some
random user's access to a site of interest, stick in the captcha' from your
site, then collect the user's response, and use it to access your site.
 How they do that is a mystery to me.

Denis,

   I'm not surprised. We'll never get rid of of cybercrooks and someone much
more clever than am I will soon bring forth a new tool. Then the good guys

Now I've done it.. I decided to upgrade my Fedora 15 laptop to Fedora
17 using the DVD. The upgrade went without error, and when I rebooted
things came up as before, but I have no network connection. If I try
manually to connect to eth0 I get:

(1) Creating object for path
'/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/17' failed in

I am sending this from my desktop computer, proof that my home network
is still working fine.

Life sucks without a connection. Any suggestions?

I've seen  what looked like attempts to use poorly code/configured
mailing forms as a kind of spam redirector,  though I'm not sure that
would be the case here unless they are also hoping for a poorly
configured  newsletter mailing list that anyone can post too.

Subject: [PLUG] Free Geek Tour for the IEEE Sustainable Technologies
	Conference
Message-ID: <20130803182123.GA21740@gate.kl-ic.com>

I presented my webslides at the IEEE Sustainable Technologies
Conference.  The reception was great.  The president-elect of
IEEE was in my audience.  This may be a small step towards more
acceptance of Powerpoint alternatives at IEEE conferences.

---

On Friday, I led a few of the participants (on foot) down from
the Lloyd Center Doubletree to Free Geek for the 4pm tour.  The
tour is designed to prepare potential volunteers, and was an
excellent introduction for sustainable technology engineers to
one of the world's most successful sustainability training
programs.  Free Geek was bursting at the seams with activity,
every nook and cranny filled with training groups and volunteers
busy with learning and rebuilding and recycling.  Indeed, there
is a two week waiting list for the build program this summer,
as all the high school students vie for the experience and that
adoption computer and training.  

Tour leader Liana did a superb job - any F.G. folks reading
this should thank her for being an excellent ambassador.  For
the engineers, it was the most exciting part of the conference;
they were absolutely blown away by the scale and efficency of
the operation, and the implications for their own sustainability
projects.  At least one is planning a future vacation in Portland,
hoping to participate at Free Geek as a volunteer.

When the engineers talked about the efficient materials handling,
or the excellent re-use of discarded materials, I reminded them
that Free Geek is primarily educational and social.   Thousands
of people in the Portland area have developed skills and confidence
in technology.  We build communities, at Free Geek and elsewhere,
based on sharing knowledge and helping each other.  It isn't just
about the widgets themselves.

Sustainability will remain a buzz word, a consumption category,
a crapload of regulations and bureaucracy and cheaters and fines,
until people creatively incorporate the essence of low impact
living into their lives.  F/OSS will remain an ignored corner
of software technology until we include our whole community in
its production and use.  We have a long way to go, but we are
moving in the right direction.  Free Geek is a big part of
that movement, and I'm glad we are participating together.

Try connecting to em1.  That's what my interface is named (it's on the
motherboard).  You probably don't have an eth0 anymore.  The new
enumeration scheme tries to name interfaces in a way that will tell
you where the interface is located.  At least, I think that's the
idea.

Also, why Fedora 17?  It hit End Of Life a while ago, and is now
unsupported.

Hope this helps.

I still have eth0. I just can't connect to it. No error messages. It's
listed as available, but I can't get a connection to it. It's been ages
since I did any networking stuff from the command line and I've
forgotten all the commands. :(

Because I have to do upgrades from the DVD. That is because the
partition for upgrade images that Fedora 11 created is now too small to
hold current images. And Fedora 18 and later use - I am not making this
up - FedUp. Amazing how accurately they anticipated my attitude.

ifconfig -a should show you all the interfaces present regardless of
state

I've come across more than one instance of udev deciding to rename
network interfaces on upgrades and the like. 

On Debian variants it does so
in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules

Its safe to delete/rename this file as it should get recreated on boot
if needed.

ifconfig -a
eth0: flags=41663<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
	inet6 fe80::21a:66bff:fed0:97f9 prefixlen 664 scopeid 0x20<link>

At a casual glance nothing looks wrong, except I wonder why wlan0 ends
in (Ethernet).

I also tried sudo ifconfig eth0 up. The command executed without error,
but I am still not connected.

Since I still have eth0 it appears that the upgrade did not rename my
network. I looked in /etc but I don't have a udev folder.

That's broken.  There should be a /etc/udev directory, with a
file, udev.conf, and a sub-directory named rules.d with several
files in it.  (This is from my live F17 box.)

Did you install _ab initio_, or did you attempt to upgrade?  I
don't care which distro it is, upgrades are more of a pain than
installing to bare metal.


I won't be available for the rest of the day; so I won't be able
to help any further.  Sorry 'bout that.

Subject: [PLUG] Easystreet, sustainability, open source
Message-ID: <20130803192854.GC21819@gate.kl-ic.com>

One of the speakers at the IEEE Sustainability Conference was
Steve Knipple, CTO and VP of engineering at colo and cloud
provider Easystreet, headquartered in Beaverton.  He told us
about Easystreet's successes in energy efficiency.  Last time
I looked, Easystreet was mostly a co-location hotel;  that is
now 10% of their business, and most of their new and existing
customers have migrated to virtualization ( aka "the cloud").
They use xen, openstack, and vmware.

Steve said they are on the lookout for software technicians
familiar with Openstack, with enough coding capability to fix
things.  They get resumes from a lot of tape monkeys, and a
lot of world class developers;  they need capable folks with
intermediate capabilities, who can help customers integrate
with the systems and tweak the apps to make this easier, as
well as implement apps for efficient energy management.  

Easystreet is in Southeast Beaverton, with limited bus service
down Arctic Drive near their headquarters, and close to
Beaverton's 5th Avenue bike path, a nice route to the
Beaverton Transit Center and MAX.  The 56 bus on Scholls
Ferry Road is a 10 minute walk away.

Steve is willing to give a talk to PLUG about their operations
and their sustainability efforts.  Michael, I can give you 
contact info.

Keith

P.S. I have an agenda here.  Besides making sure all my buddies
are gainfully employed, if the local open source community becomes
Easystreet's principal source of employees and collaboration,
and Easystreet becomes super-successful as a result,
Open Source Bridge and Barcamp get a new platinum sponsor.

Of course, before doing the upgrade I made a full backup to an external
disk. Just now I found the /etc/udev folder in the backups and copied
it to /etc. But it made no difference. I even rebooted, but no change.

I also deleted the 70-persistent-net-rules file and rebooted, but it
was not recreated.

This was an upgrade. If I ever do a fresh install it takes a week to
get everything reinstalled and working again. I have tons of specialty
programs, some of which took a long time to figure out how to get them
working.

Hopefully someone else will have some suggestions.

I am thinking that something is stopping the computer from even
attempting to connect eth0. I bet it's connected to the error message
that I mentioned at the beginning:

(1) Creating object for path
'/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/17' failed in
libnm-glib..

I have no clues about that error message, and Google doesn't know much
either.

Thanks to everyone enlightening me on the "why" of this.  I had already 
considered implementing the captcha suggestion made elsewhere in the 
thread, even with it's flaws.  It might be mildly satisfying to make the 
botnets use up even more resources trying to register for a site that's 
fully open without registration.

I should add that wireless is also not working and there are similar
lines for wlan0. And it's not just the internet, I can't even ping a
Laserjet sitting in front of me.

Something is disconnecting the network devices, but I can't figure out
what it is. Can anyone make more sense of these messages?

Message-ID: <CAJeYwHf52e2eFLP=iLYSp_6CWwEdP68bS0ttgGPvp9HaxMiNhw@mail.gmail.com>

Is another help session at Free Geek going to occur soon?  I need to
bring up a local repository on a computer, which means correctly
configuring a LAN, with dhcp, and then the repo server.  Some recent
upgrades have knocked the system out of commission, then the dhcp
software was phased out in favor of isc-dhcp software.  (this is an
Ubuntu system)

I would like to work with some network guru who is also familiar with
repositories.  Changing the Ubuntu settings using their
network-manager leads to surprises, such as the 10.42.0.x settings
when setting the connection type to "connect to local computers"  I
would like to have a little more control over this.

Thanks for letting me know.

This is the machine you were emailing about the other day?

I suspect a version mismatch...

This might help:

I believe you are referring to the Linux Clinics, which take place on the
third Sunday of each month. I've always wanted to learn how to set up a
package repository, so this may be a good opportunity. I plan to be there.

Hi,
I had pretty much the same experience this morning.  It seems to be related
to a change in the way Network-Manager does its thing.  After 6+ reboots
my issue resolved itself.  I did find something on I think ubuntu forums
that suggested paring down /etc/network/interfaces to the following lines:

  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback

and rebooting.  If you look through some of the system logs (think it was
the dbus logs) you might see the confusion as Network Manager tries and
fails.  Network Manager is a freedesktop.org product so the issue likely
happens to many distros.

Good luck...

Jeff

Thanks for the link. Unfortunately, all the solutions found by people
there require installing packages. That is pretty tough without a
network connection. Both my computers have bluetooth and they see each
other, but I can't figure out how to get the laptop to connect to the
desktop so it can use the desktop's net connection. And if it's a
version mismatch that also sounds like installing packages is going to
be required. :(

you might be able to manually configure the networking something like:

ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.125 netmask 255.255.255.0
route add default gateway 192.168.0.1

you will need to get the gateway from the working machine and guess an
ip not in use

According to netstat -nr the desktop's gateway is 192.168.0.1. I have
only half a dozen printers and a couple of computers and it has long
been my practice to put a label with its IP address on each device.
Hence, it was easy to see that 192.168.0.5 was free. So I did:

#ifconfig eth0 192,168,0,5 netmask 255.255.255.0 route add default
gateway 192.168.0.1

And the result was:

route: Unknown host

I guess that's because it can't connect to the gateway because there is
no net connection.

that was supposed to be two different commands:

OK:

#ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.5 netmask 255.255.255.0
	<executed without error>
#ifconfig eth0 up
	<executed without error>
ifconfig route add default gateway 192.168.0.1
	route: error fetching interface information: Device not found
	route: error fetching interface information: Device not found

It's like the computer has no ethernet chip.

John, not `ifconfig ...`
      just `sudo route add defaut gateway 192.168.0.1`
or skip the sudo if you're root at the moment.

That indicates the first ifconfig did not set up the interface.
What does `ifconfig eth0` show?

John Jason Jordan <johnxj at comcast.net> dijo:

For the umpteenth time today I decided to reboot. This time I paid
attention to the Grub line. It used to list three kernels, the newest
on top, which would boot automatically if I did nothing. Now it lists
one kernel at the top and then "Advanced boot options. So I selected
Advanced and was presented with three kernels, and this time with
"Recovery Mode" after each one. 

The interesting thing is that each one says Fedora 16;

Fedora Linux with Linux 3.6.11-4.fc16.x86_64
Fedora Linux with Linux 3.6.11-4.fc16.x86_64 (recovery mode)
Fedora Linux with Linux 3.6.10-2.fc16.x86_64
Fedora Linux with Linux 3.6.10-2.fc16.x86_64 (recovery mode)
Fedora Linux with Linux 3.6.7-4.fc16.x86_64
Fedora Linux with Linux 3.6.7-4.fc16.x86_64 (recovery mode)

Paul Munday mentioned earlier in this discussion that he suspected a
version mismatch. He listed an URL and it appears that sometimes the
dist-upgrade does not complete properly. The afflicted people solved
their problem by syncing their versions. But they all had net access.
How do I sync versions without a net access?

Note:  there's no IPv4 address in that.

For comparison:
$ifconfig eth0

See how the second line lists the address? And yours does not.

It looks like there is no link status for your eth0 interface.
I can't be sure as I'm not fimilar with ifconfig that outputs a portion
of the 'ip link' command.
ip link show eth0

[lbrigman at cloris ~]$ ip link show eth0
3: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP qlen
1000
    link/ether e4:1f:13:6b:9c:20 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

In this case up is OS status,
LOWER_UP is link status.

It shows the same OS and link info using the 'ip addr'
[lbrigman at cloris ~]$ ip a show eth0
3: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP qlen
1000
    link/ether e4:1f:13:6b:9c:20 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.109.0.165/22 brd 10.109.3.255 scope global eth0
    inet6 fe80::e61f:13ff:fe6b:9c20/64 scope link

"Creating object for path '/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/17'
failed in libnm-glib."

A possible solution might be to disable the Network Manager app. As JJJ
mentioned and I tend to agree with something is stopping you from being
able to manually assign an ip address to eth0.

Network Manager is a many headed monster with lots of tentacles and if it's
not happy about something it might be interfering with your attempts to
configure eth0 manually via ifconfig.

So perhaps try disable NM and try manually assigning and ip addr again.
Don't bother with adding any routes until we can get eth0 to take an ip
addr assignment.

sudo stop network-manager

At this time I'll try anything. However,

$ sudo stop network manager

Try this:

$ sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager.service

Fedora 17 has switched over to systemd almost totally.

Thanks. That seems to have worked.

Now, how do I go about manually assigning an IP address?

Good, good.  Glad to have helped.

'Fraid I can't help much there.  I don't have much experience with
networking, though I have poked around with it a bit.  Mostly I've let
Network Manager do its thing.

the theory here is that network-manager may have interfered with this
process. now that you've stopped it, it's time to try again.

you can check whether this worked or not by running ifconfig by itself
again, and see if eth0 now shoes an "inet 192.168.0.5" entry.

if it does not, something is seriously fubar and you're probably looking at
something that's beyond email assistance.

The command executed without error, but did not change anything.
Ifconfig still shows no address and I still can't go anywhere.

Regarding my last post about the interface config files. After modifying
them, you'll want to either reboot or restart networking services. I'd say
reboot and hope that the interface config file is read before NM is
invoked.

But as I don't know much about Fedora and I know that NM is heavily
embedded into most Linux sub-systems, you might even have to remove the NM
package entirely to ensure that the problem with NM isn't interfering with
your attempts to directly control the eth0 interface.

There is an option in the config file.
Setting the string like below will remove the interface from Network
Manager control.
NM_CONTROLLED=no

We do this on our servers since we typically don't have a user interface on
headless machines.

Also
all the manual configuration lines for the interface fail to mention the
'up' piece of the ifconfig command.
You can always assign an address to the interface (if NM is out of the way)
and not bring up the interface.
If you don't add 'up' to the end of the ifconfig command then
ifconfig eth0 up
as an additional command will be needed.
ping <eth0_ip_address> will check to see if the OS thinks the interface is
up and assigned.
This will get results even if the physical link connection is not there as
the kernel will bypass hardware
driver.

Easiest thing for John to do here, I think, is disable NM altogether:

$ sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager.service

should do the trick.  I think.

I sat down a played on John's laptop directly for a few minutes.  When he
upgraded to Fedora 17 it only partially upgraded his system and then bailed
for an unknown reason, but likely due to unresolved conflicts or
dependencies.  Most of the things that worked on his system were packages
that did not get upgraded; he was running a F16 version of the kernel and
Xorg but everything that was going through systemd was referencing F17
libraries that did not get installed on his system.  Trying to install
these RPMs resulted in even more dependencies and conflicts that needed
upgrading.  A quick 'rpm -qa | grep f16' resulted in about 1k packages.
 Doing 'rpm -qa | grep f17' also resulted in around 1k packages, meaning
about 50% upgrade.

Since he was still running a F16 kernel that came bundled with his network
drivers, his hardware was detected and a physical link was observable (ie
via mii-tool).  However, many of the libraries that the network tools
relied on got removed or changed to incompatible versions during the
upgrade and no longer functioned.  Even the most basic ifconfig and ip
commands wouldn't work because, while it could assign an IP address to the
interface, it could not interface with the part of the system that managed
the routing table and all DNS resolver related libraries were missing.

Now I know the OS is hosed and, since there is no net connection,
unrepairable. In other words, I'll have to do a fresh install. That
requires a budget of several days to get everything installed and
running again. One thing I know for sure: If I have to do a fresh
install it will not be Fedora. I'll probably buy a new computer too. 

A thousand thanks to Daniel for taking the time to figure this out!

Ouch.  Ouch, ouch, ouch.  Hades on a hoverboard.  Helen Damnation,
and other unpleasant people.

At this point I'm tempted to say start over.  Re-partition the
disk to something reasonable (none of this "put everything in one
big partition" crap*), and install Fedora 19 instead of 17.  (F17
no longer being supported and all.)  Then install all the extra
programs, and document what has to be done to make them work.  Buy
an engineering log book, or one of those green 1/5-inch grid
pads.  PSU bookstore should have both.

HOWEVER, that said, I know John doesn't want to go through all the
pain of making all that stuff work again.  So here's my last gasp
thought on the subject.  Mount the F17 installation DVD -- don't
try to run it, just mount it.  Navigate to the Packages directory
and see what's there.  It'll either be all of the packages, or a
set of directories, one for each letter of the alphabet.

If it's one massive directory full of packages, fine.  Get the
list of all the F16 packages still installed, strip off the
version info, and feed it to yum.  You may need a "--local" flag;
I don't remember when they removed that option.

If it's a set of directories, do the same basic thing, but sort
the list of packages into alphabetized chunks, and feed them to
yum one letter at a time.  A small bash script should work just
fine.

That _should_ get enough of F17 installed that you can do whatever
else you need to do.  No guarantees.  I still recommend
documenting your additional software.  Stuff from Fedora or the
RPMFusion repos most likely won't need that; they're set up to
work "out of the box", so to speak.  But other stuff will need
more attention, as you've found out.

* I could go on a rather, um, inflamed rant on the subject, but
I'll spare us all.  (I'm too lazy to write it.)  I will just say
that putting everything in one massive partition is, IMO, a bad
idea.  John, if you want to know how I recommend setting up a
disk, and why, let me know and I'll write something up for you.

Anyway, I hope this helps.  Good luck.

Hmm. The DVD has them sorted into folders  by letter of the alphabet.
There are over 3,000 packages.

Just now I re-ran "rpm -qa |grep fc16" and searched in the 
DVD folders for just the first five that the command produced:

	deluge-web-1.3.5-1fc16.noarch
	perl-Gtk2-Ex-PodViewer-0.18--8.fc16.noarch
	gnome-shell-extension-user-theme-3.2.3-2.fc16.noarch
	scribus-debuginfo.1.4.2-2.fc16.x86_64
	pixman.0.24.4-1.fc16.i686

Only the pixman package was on the DVD, and it was a newer version. But
when I searched on the Scribus package above I noted that the DVD did
not have that package, but it did have scribus-1.4.0-5.fc17.x86_64.rpm,
yet I have 1.4.2 installed already.

>That _should_ get enough of F17 installed that you can do whatever
>else you need to do.  

If recall from things Daniel said, Fedora 17 uses systemd, where
previous versions did not. I wonder how many packages like that would
not be in my list of fc16 packages, thus I would never get them
installed. Also, how many of the packages in the fc16 list are just
leftovers that are not actually used any more but didn't get deleted
for some reason.

Your plan sounds like quite a lot of work with very little likelihood
of success. On the other hand, at this point I have nothing to lose.

I will say it again: If I must do a fresh install, it won't be Fedora.
I want something where I can get the latest versions of *some*
packages, but I also want stability and I hate the forced upgrades. I
understand the philosophy and raison d'?tre of Fedora, and it's not for
me. 

My computer is also five years old, the SD reader broke a year ago and
the DVD drive has a flaky connection. I've been thinking about a
new computer for some time. Perhaps this event is just fate telling me
it's time to move on.

Message-ID: <CAJeYwHfe8eD41wSTsiyiu_5=F7ijy7sy9VXOhvqn3Nu2qqM4sg@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone know why rsync command echoes the folders when backing up
from an ext4 folder into a NTFS folder?  Normally, using the "rsync
-avg --delete /folder ." command on a linux file system (ext2 or ext3
or ext4) rsync will only indicate a true update to the files/folders
if it occurs.

However for a reason unknown to me, rsync seems to post all folders
when backing to an NTFS file system regardless if a true file update
occurs or not.

Does anyone know why this is happening?

   There are several Slackware uses here and I hope one (or more) of you can
help me solve a problem; the solution keeps eluding me.

   I updated all patched packages on the Sony Vaio laptop with slackpkg, and
copied the .new config files to the base config files execpt for
rc.inet1.conf which has the local network configuration.

   When the system now starts it insists on starting KDE rather than Xfce4.
Since I don't install KDE (other than the base for compatability with other
packages) I don't know how this was selected in the GUI login manager.
(Note: I forget where I can turn that off; a reminder will help me.)

   Running xwmconfig I select xfce4 and either reboot or shut down the
system, but when it comes back up it remains in KDE.

   ~/<user>/.xinitrc calls /usr/bin/startxfce4
   /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc points to xinitrc.xfce

   Where do I look to learn why KDE keeps popping up rather than Xfce?

   Well, ... I inadvertently installed all of KDE and the languages and did

   Interesting. Removing all of KDE but the baseapps and library allowed the
system to use Xfce4 when set to runlevel 4. There's a funky huge dialog box
that does not display any asterisks when the password is entered rather than
the former small dialog box that displayed password asterisks. Oh, well. It
works.

In the process of shopping for a new laptop I discovered that I don't
understand how video works in laptops these days. In the past I have
always had nothing but nVidia (Quadro NVS 140M and GeForce 6150 in my
Thinkpad and desktop, respectively), but of late there have been issues
with the drivers. Perhaps I should be looking at something else.

1) I see laptops at the Clinic that seem to have two video chips, like
Intel and nVidia. And one of the laptops that I am seriously
considering* has Intel and nVidia. Why?

2) In the past Intel had a reputation of lower power consumption, and
nVidia the worst. Is that still true?

3) I will want full video functionality - GL graphics, flash, etc. Are
there any chips to be avoided?

*I really like the Traverse Pro:

Decked out the way I would want it, including a USB3 docking station
it comes to about $3K.

I've had good luck over the years with the nvidia proprietary drivers.
The F/OSS nv is deprecated and nouveau is getting better.

Switchable or Optimus graphics.  Nvidia for games, 1080p video, and
power user stuff, Intel for power savings when only 2D and light duty
3D.  This setup is sometimes EXTREMELY difficult to get working properly
under Linux due to the proprietary nature of the configuration.

Pretty much for laptops and destops.  The tegra line is for portable
devices.  However, the Geforce "M" series for desktop chips have decent
power management.

Intel, ATI/AMD.  YMMV.  I don't like Radeon since AMD drops older
support like a hot rock. The F/OSS radeonhd drivers are getting better
but I still have lots of issues with them.

However, Intel recently  dumped a chuck of code into the kernel to
improve driver etc support.  The newer Intel 4600HD GPUs look good.
Still not as good as Nvidia for 1920x1080 HD gaming, but decent enough
if you turn some of the eye candy down.

Intel + nVidia = Optimus.  Not yet well supported under Linux,
though it is being worked on.  The idea being that for long-term
battery operation, 2D or low-stress 3D graphics and the like, the
Intel system runs, saving power.  For high-end 3D graphics, HD
videos and the like, nVidia runs.  Sort of a "best of both worlds"
set up.

I have a GT 520, which uses a GF119 chip.  For most of what I do,
it's fine.  For high end graphics work (HD videos, etc.), it's
slow.  Videos get jerky, and so on.  Still, for $60, I'm not
really unhappy.

Oh man oh man, I'm drooling.  Don't do this to me John.  :-)  It
looks lovely.  The only cavil I would have is the touchpad.  It
looks like it has only two buttons, unless the fingerprint reader
doubles as the middle mouse button.  Of course, since I loathe
touchpads, I'd probably get a real mouse and turn off the touchpad
altogether.

This is why I never use graphical logons.  'xwmconfg' only works under
runlevel 3 when using CLI logon and then 'startx'

If you used any kdm/gdm/xdm etc (graphical display managers) for login,
they have their own config files.  Xfce doesn't ship with one.  Thus, if
you set runlevel 4, Xfce doesn't know what to do. Since you had KDE
installed, KDE *does* know what to do with runlevel 4 as it ships with a
GUI logon manager - which is set by default to load KDE regardless of
what xwmconfig sets.

Since you dumped KDE, runlevel 4 now looks for xdm (part of X11)- an
older more primitive display manager.

/etc/rc.d/rc.4
~/.xinitrc
~/.xsession
/etc/kde/kdm
/etc/X11/xdm

Have fun!

I also can't stand touchpads. On my Thinkpad I dsiabled it in the BIOS
and I use an external regular mouse, but I left the trackpoint enabled.
The trackpoint doesn't bother me, and if I get to PSU and discover that
I left my mouse at home I have at least something to point with.

I just sent an e-mail to Puget Systems with seven questions, one of
which was whether I can disable the touchpad in the desktop
environment. It has no trackpoint for backup, so I might need to enable
it without having to reboot. I assume it can be disabled//enabled from
the command line, but I wanted confirmation.

I also asked them how the video works with, say, Xubuntu.

Ed,

   I don't use 'em, either. The Sony is used by my friend who prefers the GUI
logon. The other advantage of the GUI is that the user can reboot or halt
the system without knowing root's password or being a sudouser.

   Interesting. It did not intrude until today's bunch of package upgrades.

   Ah! That's where it is. I completely forgot its location.

   The Sony Vaio will give me ulcers. Now that I upgraded the Slackware
packages I can reach other hosts on the LAN but cannot connect to any
external site on the eth0 interface. My Web searches fail to show me what's
mis-configured here. I'd greatly appreciate ideas because I'm supposed to
leave on a business trip tomorrow morning and I need to get this laptop
connecting to the 'Net.

   /etc/resolv.conf is correct (matches what's on the other LAN hosts).
That's normally the problem when I return with my portable and with wireless
DHCP connection has reset that file. Why it's not fixing the problem here I
don't know.

   ifconfig -a shows that etho is RUNNING.

   /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf is set as before.

   I've re-run '/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 restart', '/etc/rc.d/inetd restart' and
rebooted the machine but still cannot get outside the local LAN.

   What have I missed here?

Just some thoughts:
Did you check /var/log/syslog and /var/log/messages for clues? Are you
running wired or wireless? Did you run "netconfig" as root to get a
good base setup (you can then tweak after)? Are you running wicd
and/or network manager? Can't use both!  Also, if using nm, you can't
manually specify network params: they have to be set with the nm
applet.  Is your router/modem/whatever set to block certain MAC
addresses from getting out?

   No, because the setup in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf has not changed from
before this package upgrades and there was no problem connecting to the
external 'Net then.

   Not when on the ethernet; wicd when wireless.

   No. The Sony had no issues on the ethernet before the package upgrades and
my moving what I thought were new config files to the existing config files
that I had not modified.

Ed,

   As I started looking at /var/log/messages it occurred to me to check the
kernel routing table; sure enough, no default route. How that got clobbered
I've no idea, but that -- along with /etc/resolv.conf -- will prevent
connections outside the LAN.

   route add default gw 192.168.55.4 eth0

solved the problem.

Thanks to you and Larry for getting me thinking of what I did not check,

Rich

Rich - It sounds to me like you've got a routing problem. FYI, the "host"
command is not a very valid or useful test in this case. because it's most
likely getting the DNS information from your upstream wifi router. That is
to say the Sony network client is making a doing a name lookup to a DNS
server on the internet.

What does your routing table look like when you run the command "netstat
-rn"

Also, what is the output of "ifconfig -a"

I have had a series of e-mail interchanges with Puget Systems, mostly
regarding the video. In my next to the last e-mail I asked what their
return policy is. The reply was:

"My understanding is that the NVIDIA driver supports the GTX 770M and
780M models available on the Traverse Pro, but Ubuntu doesn't have the
necessary packages to make it work. I believe that if you are willing
to download some additional source code such as XRandR 1.4, X Server
1.14, and the latest Intel driver module and compile them, it may be
possible to get it working. We are still trying to get a working Ubuntu
configuration for the Pro models. But for now, I can't guarantee any
support of the NVIDIA graphics under Ubuntu. "

I guess I'm crossing the Traverse Pro off my list.

But that leads me to wonder if there are *any* high end laptops for sale
today that I can get decent 3D video with - movies, flash, GL, etc.

Try System76. They have some nice stuff - dying to get one myself.
IIRC, they come preloaded with Ubuntu, or you can pick your distro of
choice.

One of my problems is that I have become spoiled. Shortly after getting
my Thinkpad T61 Keith suggested that I get a docking station. It was
one of his better ideas.

But few laptop makers these days offer dedicated docking stations.
Instead they all rely on third party USB 3.0 docking stations. I am not
averse to that idea, but it means that when home there will always be a
USB cable plugged into the side of the laptop, getting in the way of
books and papers, and being constantly bumped, eventually causing the
jack to fail. The Traverse Pro is one of the few 15.6 inch laptops that
I found with one of the USB 3.0 ports clear at the back. Still on the
side, but at least mostly out of the way.

The System 76 Bonobo Extreme does have a USB 3.0 port clear at the
back. But it's a 17 inch laptop. I love the real estate, but schlepping
it around does not sound like fun. 

But I did send them a list of questions just now.

If your criterion is "decent 3D", I think that any Intel Ivy Bridge 
video would likely meet your needs.  Serious gamers want the high 
performance offered by high end Nvidia and AMD solutions, but for most 
people, Intel video has certainly reached the "good enough" level.  If I 
were you, I would be looking at laptops that use the mobile version of 
the Ivy Bridge architecture, or perhaps Haswell if you like to be on the 
bleeding edge.

Here are a few links that might be useful.  Note that phoronix has a 
tendency to sensationalize, so best to take everything with a grain of salt.

System76 only supports Ubuntu.  Zareason https://zareason.com supports
several distros.  Think Penguin https://www.thinkpenguin.com is extremely
flexible about what distros they support.

Think Penguin doesn't offer anything high end. Zareason, however, I
find to be far more interesting. I have actually seen and played with a
Zareason for a bit as someone brought one to the Clinic a few months
ago. Very impressive machine. It booted straight Ubuntu from cold in 12
seconds (I timed it). Who needs suspend? But the USB 3.0 ports are all
right up front

Subject: [PLUG] Where does Linux store printer information?
Message-ID: <20130808080611.206ab2c2@Devil8>

I have wiped out Fedora and installed Xubuntu on my Thinkpad. Before
doing so, of course, I made two backups to an external USB drive, one
with rdiff-backup and the other with the cp command (nearly 160,000
files!). 

Usually after installing a package I can overwrite its . file with the
one from my backups. When I launch the app, even for the first time, it
comes up with all my personal settings. 

However, I need to restore my printer drivers. I have half a dozen
laser printers and had more than one driver for most of them. Getting
the printers configured properly usually took a lot of time and
googling. Somewhere in the mass of files in my backups the printer
information must be stored. If I have to reinstall each one from
scratch it will take many hours. Please tell me the information is in
my backups!

I will add another Linux friendly shop to consider.
Full disclosure, I used to work there several years ago.

eRacks Open Source Systems, they are based in CA, so shipping to OR should
be fairly quick.
Interesting little side note, I was the one who initiated the laptop line
way back when (did the hardware compatibility testing, research,
availability of different models, etc etc).  As you can probably guess by
their name the bread and butter of their business is rackmount servers.

They of course have modern laptops now, including a couple nice looking
high end models, with NVidia GPU and Intel Ivy Bridge CPU, and your choice
of Linux.  They are not tied to any one distro.

http://eracks.com/products/laptops/

FWIW I still have my eRacks Centrino laptop, from the first run, it is a
bit of a dinosaur now but still runs fine, I have Mint 13 on it.

Subject: [PLUG] Ownerships and permissions mess
Message-ID: <20130808150559.109bac95@Devil8>

I have been using a 3 TB Seagate Go-Flex Desk USB 3.0 drive to store
backups and movies, labeled Movies. It is also the default location
where Ktorrent stores downloads. 

I had recently downloaded all the Fedora 19 files via torrent, so they
were on this drive. Just now I dragged them from Movies to my
laptop drive with Thunar. I got a bunch of permission errors. So I
looked at the Movies drive from the command line and found a mess. About
half of the files are owned by "500" and the rest by me. The
permissions appear to be OK for both (rwxrwxrwx, although some are
rwxrwxr-x).

And another odd thing, using Gnome-terminal, for about a third of the
files and folders the permissions, ownership and size columns are OK,
but the name is an unreadable solid green bar, of a length equal to the
number of characters in the actual name. 

All this appears to have come about after wiping out Fedora and
installing Xubuntu. On the other hand, I rarely move files back and
forth from Movies, so the mess could have been going on for a long time.

Should I just chown them all to jjj:jjj? So that I can avoid this in
the future, what could cause this to happen?

That's a Red Hat-ism.  They chose to start user UIDs/GIDs at 500,
while Debian chose to start with 1000.  I assume you're using a
Debian-based system now, so this isn't surprising -- well, not to
me, anyway. :-)

Huh.  Green text on a blank background means the executable bit is
set.  I don't know what a green background means, nor the
combination of the two.  Check your /etc/DIR_COLORS* files and see
if anything is supposed to set the background to green.

Yes.  As I said above, it's just because Red Hat and Debian chose
different starting points for the normal user UIDs and GIDs.  As
of F17, Fedora has also gone to a starting point of 1000.  So that
particular problem shouldn't show up anymore.  (Of course, I have
no idea what other distributions do.)

Hope this helps.

Does anyone know the purpose of RTNETLINK as being used in Ubuntu
distributions?  I found that apparently this program was monitoring my
network connections and a man page lookup shows that it is used to
change network connections in the kernel.

The first sentence of the man page reads "Rtnetlink allows the
kernel's routing tables to be read and altered."

In my experience, a green background means a directory is
world-writeable.  File names don't seem to get the same treatment.

Subject: [PLUG] Raspberry Pi - Turning Off Screensaver
Message-ID: <CAGQMCk8KwJXUPCwiRcEBFRXnHD6Am797VJhRDsi9ng1vY9kBFg@mail.gmail.com>

I've been googling for ways to prevent the screensaver from blanking the
screen every 10 min in the Raspbian Wheezy Ubuntu GUI. I've found 2
reasonable-sounding methods that had no effect at all, seems there's a lot
of confusion on this. Was using a raspbian boot image from October last
year, now using the raspbian image that came out last month (July 27?).

One kludge that occured to me was have a cron task that simulated a slight
mouse movement or press of the shift key every 5 minutes, but not obvious
to me if/how that would be possible.

Alternatively, I could bypass the whole GUI if I knew how to make the whole
screen a drawable-canvas in python from the command-line mode... I know
graphics should be possible, since there's that color raspi logo up in
corner whole time, and since I can run video via omxplayer from the non-GUI
mode shell prompt.

In general, would be nice to know if anyone is working on fun pi
projects... I'm trying to get a wordcloud program running on it as part of
an interactive art display.

After my first post here I noticed that all the solid green ones were
folders owned by jjj:jjj. *Files* owned by jjj:jjj were not affected.
And folders and files owned by 500 were not affected. I should add that
when I say "solid green bar" I mean the background and the text are

the length of the bar.

So I did sudo chown -R* jjj:jjj /media/Movies/*. After it ended I am
now the owner of all the files and folders, except .Trash, which is
still owned by 500. I specifically tried to take ownership of .Trash as
well, but the terminal said "silly boy, that file does not exist." Or
something like that. OK, who cares.

But the interesting thing is that the ones that had solid green names
before still have solid green names, and the ones with normal names
still have normal names, even though I now own all of them.

My next theory is that there is a date involved here. Folders created
after or before some date are the ones with the solid green names. Is
there a way to do a ls command and have it sort by date of creation?

For most distros, by default, yes.  World readable file names will be
green text.  This is standard behavior if you mount a Windows NTFS drive
on Linux. Is your drive NTFS?  You will have an easier time if you use a
linux native format.

User 500 *was* you when the files where created.  This was the default
UUID.  When you reinstalled, *you* became UUID 1000, obviously a
different "person"

You can usually delete .Trash-500, a new file .Trash-1000 will be
created (but only if you are root, not via sudo, the old one DOES NOT
BELONG TO YOU).  I've had external drives with a .Trash-xxx for every
user that accessed that drive.

Because there is NO ONE PROGRAMMING AUTHORITY in F/OSS. Also, if a

Subject: [PLUG] All applications died
Message-ID: <20130809113729.22fed575@Devil8>

I had numerous applications open on my newly installed Xubuntu laptop -
Claws Mail, Firefox, Synaptic, Terminal, Ktorrent, Gedit, Evince, and a
couple more. I was in Firefox reading about the latest mobile CPUs from
Intel and suddenly all applications vanished. The OS is running fine. I
just relaunched Claws Mail to write this.

I've had one application die, I've had the entire OS die, I've had X
die, but I've never even heard of having all running apps die
simultaneously.

I'm wondering if there is a global kill-9 command that might have been
invoked somehow. But the only apps that died were those on the desktop;
all the numerous service apps that run in the background were
apparently unaffected.

This is turning out to be a really weird Friday.

Never mind. They didn't all die. They disappeared from the desktop, but
some were still running. I discovered that when I tried to launch
Update Manager and it said it was waiting for Synaptic to quit. The Task
Manager GUI told me what was running and killed them for me. 

Still very strange.

There /is/ such a command, but I don't think that's what happened (fwiw,
it's 'kill -9 -1', which kills all processes by the currently running user).

It sounds like your window manager crashed (and was possibly restarted, but
didn't recover properly).  That /could/ make all the windows disappear, or
make them all show up on the same desktop (which may be off screen), or do
any number of weird things with how your currently open X applications are
displayed.

I don't know of a great way to recover from that situation, killing them
via task manager and restarting is possibly the best option, although you
/might/ be able to use a command-line window management tool like wmctrl to
make them show up again, but it's complicated.

Are you sure they vanished.  I use Xfce, on another, superior distro
=;-) and sometimes while scrolling with the mouse wheel end up flipping
to another virtual desktop.

Or, when they vanished, did the screen go blank/black for a second?  X
could have restarted.

This could be the case if security updates were applied in the
background (apt-get of whatever you kids are using these days). There
was some talk of this a few years ago IIRC.

Try

   ls -lrt

sorts oldest to newest.

Also, you might try

   \ls

or

   ls --color=never

to temporarily strip off the green-on-green text.

Subject: [PLUG] Need 32-bit Debian based user
Message-ID: <20130810080411.0cf3cbbf@Devil8>

I have Mint on one computer and Xubuntu on the other. I need to convert
a 32-bit .rpm to .deb. Normally one would just use alien to convert it,
and alien would be happy to do so for me, except that alien only works
within the same architecture. I need someone with a 32-bit Debian based
computer to convert the following 32-bit .rpm to .deb for me. 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/ltc/?source=recommended

The file is ltc-3.0.4-1.fc13.i386.rpm. 

My Xubuntu did not come with alien installed, but sudo apt-get install
alien will take care of it if your computer does not already have it. 

I don't know if the resulting 32-bit .deb will install on 64-bit
Xubuntu, but I can always hope. The 32-bit .rpm did install on 64-bit
Fedora.

Creation? 

That isn't available in contemporary *nix, including Linuxes. 

    ctime  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stat_(Unix)

    ctime originally meant creation time,[8] however it has since been
    used almost always to refer to change time. It is updated any time
    file content changes (together with mtime), and also by changes in
    metadata such as file permissions, file ownership, and creation and
    deletion of hard links. In some implementations, ctime is affected by
    renaming a file (both original Unix and modern Linux tend to do this).

    Unlike atime and mtime, ctime cannot be set to an arbitrary value
    with utime() (as used e.g. by touch). Instead, when utime() is used,
    the ctime value is set to the current time.

And this is confirmed by `man 2 stat`

All of these system calls return a stat structure, which contains the following fields:

           struct stat {
               dev_t     st_dev;     /* ID of device containing file */
               ino_t     st_ino;     /* inode number */
               [ other stuff snipped ]
               time_t    st_atime;   /* time of last access */
               time_t    st_mtime;   /* time of last modification */
               time_t    st_ctime;   /* time of last status change */
           };

John,

No need to go through all that pain.  Go to the SourceForge
location for ltc:

<http://sourceforge.net/projects/ltc/files/ltc/>

Now go into the 3.1.0 directory.  There you will find a .deb file
for the latest version of ltc.  Also the source file (.tar.gz).
To be honest, I'd probably grab the source file.  But I'm strange
that way.  :-)

As for installing 32-bit programs on a 64-bit system, that
shouldn't be a problem, so long as you've got the right
libraries.  You should have two /usr/lib* directories: /usr/lib
and either /usr/lib32 or /usr/lib64.  Red Hat and Fedora use
lib64, but I think Debian and the 'buntus use lib32.  The number
tells you the "bittage" (if you will) of the libraries in said
directory.

Hope this helps.

Well, it wouldn't install due to missing dependencies:

jjj at Devil8:~/Software/Linguistic_Tree_Structure$ sudo dpkg -i

Selecting previously unselected package ltc:i386.

Unpacking ltc:i386 (from ltc_3.1.0-1_i386.deb) ...

 ltc:i386 depends on binutils.
dpkg: error processing ltc:i386 (--install):

I stopped here. I could probably install those missing dependencies,
but I worry that doing so might mess up something else.

Checking in Synaptic I find that I do have all three installed:

libwxbase2.8-0
libwxgtk2 2.8.0
binutils 2.2.2 

Now, of course there is the source file. But wouldn't it need the same
dependencies?

   Has anyone ideas on what might remove the default route when the system is

   Please accept my apologies for cluttering your mailbox on such a nice
summer Saturday afternoon. After posting my message I went back to looking
for the source of the problem and found it; naturally, after sending the
message, not before.

   Apparently, when checking configuration files after upgrading packages I
must have inadvertently changed one digit in the IP address of the default
gateway in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf. Sigh. As there was no valid default
gateway in the configuration file none was established when the system was
rebooted.

Mea culpa,

Rich

it would, but may offer more information about what's missing. it does

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1308111015330.355@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   After many months I'm finally setting up the Belkin Advance N900 wireless
router. It's connected via a cat5 cable directly to my laptop. The default
IP address for the Belkin is 192.168.2.1. When I enter that address (without
the http protocol preceeding it, per the Belkin users manual) firefox
responds by telling me that it cannot establish a connection to that server.

   Opera also reports it cannot connect to a server at that IP address.

   Is there anything obvious I've missed? If not, I will wait for next week's
clinic and bring Belkin N900, laptop, cable, and myself there for help.

Try specifying the http:// protocol anyway.  You're going to be
connecting to an html page, so it can't hurt.  I think Belkin is
expecting the browser to prepend the protocol specifier automatically.
In these suspicious days, they may not do that anymore.

Do you have a network address in that network?  What's the output of 'ifconfig -a'?

Dale,

   I did use http://192.168.2.1 first. Makes no difference. And, both firefox
and opera pre-pend the protocol.

   After searching for more insights on the Web and futzing here I've decided
that the Belkin just does not want to work here. I reset it, tried different
ethernet ports, tried from the workstation, etc. No previous wireless access
point/router was this recalcitrant.

   So, I've ordered an Asus N900 unit.

Russell,

   No, I don't. But, I can reach external web servers via their IP address
even though I'm not on their network.

   ifconfig -a shows eth0 UP and RUNNING.

as I recall, you have a tendency to set up your network nodes with static
IP addresses. this scenario is one of the downsides of such a setup - your
static IP is not within the logical definition of the router's network.

try switching to DHCP, or setting statically an IP within the 192.168.2.x
range. once you're logged in to the router's management interface, you can
change the router's IP to be within 192.168.55.x, and then change your
machine's IP back to its previous. also, configure the router's built-in
DHCP server to hand out addresses that won't conflict with your statically
assigned ones.

then, you'll be able to reach the router's management interface from any
machine on the network.

oh, also: don't use the Belkin's WAN or Internet port unless you're using
it as  your primary router. Simply leave it empty if it's just being used
as an access point. plug the wire going to your upstream switch or router
into the Belkin's LAN port.

   Not only a tendency, but that's what I do. With only a few hosts there's
no advantage to DHCP.

   I was looking for my saved message on how to set a second eth0 interface,
but I cannot find it. That's what I did before. Thinking a bit more, I
realize that reaching a world-addressable IP address is different from
reaching a non-world-addressible IP address from within the LAN.

   I'll go search for the ifconfig syntax to add a second network to eth0.

Thanks, Wes,

   Close, but no cigar.

   The netmask in this command is incorrect. What should it be?

   route add -net 192.168.2.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0:0

The error is that the netmask does not match the route address.

By "connected to your laptop", I assume you are plugged into a LAN port,
and the activity lights blink properly.

Can you ping 192.168.2.1?  What happens if you turn off iptables for
your laptop?  How does your laptop get its IP address?  What does 
ifconfig say?  What does route -N say?  Have you tried booting your
laptop from a Live CD, and seen if you can connect that way?

Chances are, this is a laptop configuration opportunity rather than
a Belkin problem.  Networking setup can be complicated, but then, 
connecting to a billion other machines on the planet via IP is
intrinsically non-simple.  Linux, with all the extra security bells
and whistles, can be configured to be even more complicated.  These
days, out of the box, Linux Just Works, but over the years I imagine
you have made some tweaks.

Years ago, I learned how to do networking from Peter Harrison's "Linux
Home Networking" website, which later became the book "The Linux Quick
Fix Notebook".  That has some excellent explanations, though it might
be dated and incomplete 8 years after publication.  Full disclosure: I
was the one who gave a copy of Peter's manuscript to the Prentiss-Hall
rep at OSCON many years ago, so I am biased in its favor.  Peter and
I still talk sometimes;  he has the most mellifluous Jamaican accent.
Rule 1 of the open source community:  if someone does something great,
thank them, and help them if you can.

Larry,

   Trying to add another IP address, in a different subnet, did not work for
me. The Slackware syntax,

 	route add -net 192.168.2.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0:1

returns "netmask does not match network."

   Taking a different approach I did,

 	ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.2.1 up

and this worked; I can ping 192.168.2.1 from the directly connected laptop.
And, the kernel routing table has a route for that IP address on eth0. 
However, ... I cannot access that IP address from firefox.

   What might I still be missing here?

Rich,

My last two routers had a default address of 192.168.0.1.  YMMV

 192.168.2.1 is the router's IP address. you've added this same IP address
to your computer's network interface, thereby creating an IP address
conflict.

change this to 192.168.2.2 and you should be good to go.

Two suggestions --

1) If you're getting Internet access through the router, run a

route -n
(or netstat -nr)

The gateway for the default route should match the IP address of the
router. It isn't necessarily 192.168.2.1

You should be able to access the router admin interface through the
gateway address.

2) Reset the router. There's usually some way, perhaps with a paper
clip, to restore the default original settings for the router.

Thanks,
Mike

Ken,

   It's not my milage. The Belkin user manual tells us the default IP address
is 192.168.2.1. Shrug.

wes,

   Ah, yes! Brain fog from getting too close. This did the trick, thank you
very much.

   Connection from the laptop to the Belkin is very slow, but it does seem to
be working.

Much appreciated,

Rich

"After many months I'm finally setting up the Belkin Advance N900 wireless
router. It's connected via a cat5 cable directly to my laptop. The default
IP address for the Belkin is 192.168.2.1"

Rich - Can you ping and get a response from the ip address of the Belkin.
If not, and you're directly connected to it, you must have an ip address on
the same subnet. Also, which port of the Belkin device are you connected
to? Hopefully, one of the LAN switch ports. If it responds to a ping, then
try "telnet 192.168.2.1 80". That will tell you whether or not you connect
to the device via http in the event some configuration setting has disabled
that ability.

Subject: [PLUG] Raspbian Wheezy Screensaver Shutoff - Raspberry Pi
Message-ID: <CAC+jgt85SFnMfRd_ZNi5CBC+Az2GSnmpK8bsHokx0AnAr=NCvw@mail.gmail.com>

I've been googling for ways to prevent the screensaver from blanking
the screen every 10 min in the Raspbian Wheezy Ubuntu GUI. I've found
2 reasonable-sounding methods that had no effect at all, seems there's
a lot of confusion on this. Was using a raspbian boot image from
October last year, now using the raspbian image that came out last
month (July 27?).

One kludge that occured to me was have a cron task that simulated a
slight mouse movement or press of the shift key every 5 minutes, but
not obvious to me if/how that would be possible.

Alternatively, I could bypass the whole GUI if I knew how to make the
whole screen a drawable-canvas in python from the command-line mode...
I know graphics should be possible, since there's that color raspi
logo up in corner whole time, and since I can run video via omxplayer
from the non-GUI mode shell prompt.

In general, would be nice to know if anyone is working on fun pi
projects... I'm trying to get a wordcloud program running on it as
part of an interactive art display.

I don't have a Raspberry Pi, but I do know that there is not much
reason for a screensaver on an LCD screen. Probably what you have
instead is some kind of power saving scheme and one of the things it
does is turn off the screen. Have you checked the power saving
configuration?

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1308111503340.5993@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Now I have the Belkin configured -- sorta' -- I need to tweak the setup
but find no answers in the user manual or on Belkin's web page for this
model. Perhaps someone here has experience with this brand and model and can
offer guidance on setting clients and admin name and password.

   When I try to add a password it's rejected; I can only leave that field
blank. I'm not worried about anyone here getting into it (other than me) and
want assurance that it's secure from outside. I have set protection to WPA2
PassPhrase and stored the latter in the WAP's memory.

   On the Linksys and Asus wireless routers I could add static IP addresses,
host names, and MAC addresses for the two portables here and restrict use of
the wireless access to only those two. On the Belkin the page for client
list is blank when neither portable is connected; I cannot add clients to
that list. Also, the Belkin assigns 192.168.55.100 to my portable (which is
an unused number), but /etc/hosts and related files know the portable as
192.168.55.2. Is there a way to associate static IP addresses of the two
portables? When I tried setting the Belkin to use static IP addresses it was
not happy with me. Perhaps I did not follow the protocol it wanted.

   Any insights into tuning my configuration so the two portables can access
other LAN hosts and the 'Net via this WAP will be much appreciated.

Have you turned DHCP off?  It sounds to me like the router is trying
to be a DHCP server.

Dale,

   No, I left DHCP on. On previous Linksys and Asus WAPs I could leave DHCP
on yet 'suggest' IP addresses associated with MAC addresses.

   Based on your question I'll try turning off DHCP and see it that allows me
to specify client IP addresses. Back soon with the results ...

   Nuts! Turning off LAN DHCP still does not allow me to enter host IP
addresses. With no hosts trying to connect wirelessly the Belkin shows no
clients. Seems to me that the unit insists on being a router rather than
simply a wireless access point which is a node on the LAN. I'll try Belkin
tech support tomorrow and see if there is a way to configure it strictly as
a WAP rather than a router and bridge to the 'Net.

Thanks,

Rich

   On a whim I did some Web searching and learned that all these years I've
been buying the wrong hardware for my needs. For whatever the reason I
started with the Linksys wireless routers and I've replaced failed units
with other routers. Yet all I've needed is an access point, not a router or
bridge.

   I see WAPs all over the place but did not make the connection to my needs
versus my hardware. So, the newly ordered wireless router will be refused
when deliverd (amazon has it too far in the process after a few hours today)
and replace with a WAP-only unit. That should make life easier for me. In
case others might have the same need for a WAP rather than a router I offer
what I've learned.

the only difference between an access point and a router is the existence
of the WAN port. you can simply not use the WAN port and effectively turn
your router into an access point.

wes,

   While that's true, not all routers make it easy (or even possible) to
configure them as access points. The Belden N900 seems to fit in this
category.

there is no configuration involved - just don't use the WAN port. POOF your
router has become an access point. when I do this, I also disable the
internal DHCP server, to avoid conflicts with my previously existing DHCP
server. but your situation is a little different.

It would have the advantage that your network would work most of the
time, as opposed to the way you are doing it now.  PLUG traffic would
drop 80%.  ;-)

There is one disadvantage to this, particularly when (like me), you
sometimes deposit routers in third-party locations.  Clever users,
when encountering unrelated non-workingness (like upstream ISP
problems, etc), will notice that the ethernet is in "the wrong port"
(TM) and helpfully "fix it" (TM) for you, necessitating a house call
to recover properly.

The strategy I adopt for those cases is either: a) put a piece of tape
over the WAN port (or hotglue or similar); or b) with my own OpenWrt
firmware image on the device, bridge the WAN and LAN ports together so
it doesn't matter which port the cable goes in (sometimes, depending
on the hardware, this is just a matter of altering the switch
configuration).  Stock firmware generally isn't going to let you do
(b).

As far as I can see, there is really no good argument nor any advantage to
not do this. A true wifi access point is typically more of an enterprise
class device. It doesn't have a WAN port because it's designed just to
uplink the wireless network traffic to a switch/router and connect with the
rest of the enterprise network.

As Wes alluded to, the routing happens on the WAN port as a routers primary
purpose is to connect two separate ip subnets. So if you just connect your
Belkin via a switch port to your upstream switch/router and use static ips
for the devices hanging off the Belkin then you should be all set.

Ideally, the way I would configure this is have both wireless devices use
DHCP but have separate pools so there's no conflicts. So in your case this
might look something like:

Belkin N900: 192.168.2.1
Upstream Router: 192.168.2.103
Belkin N900 DHCP pool: 192.168.2.2 - 192.168.2.102
Upstream Route DHCP pool: 192.168.2.104 - 192.168.2.204
Netmask for all of this is: 255.255.255.0

This way you have plenty of ip addrs for each wifi ap switch/router device
that are clearly defined and easily remembered. You can even print out a
piece of paper with the ip nets and tape them to the device. If you want
configure a device with a static ip on one of the two ip nets, just ping ip
addrs in the dhcp pool from a computer that has an ip on that ip net to
find one that is not in use.

Or to even one step further, you can break those DHCP pools in half. For
example:

Belkin DHCP Pool: 192.168.2.2 - 192.168.2.52
Belkin Static ip addrs: 192.168.2.53. - 192.168.2.103

Let me know if I can be of any help in getting this all setup.

Cheers,

Not such a good idea, IMHO.  The "access point" dhcp server is going
to be giving itself out as the default route, unless you can tell it
otherwise.  Also, some embedded dhcp servers listen for other dhcp
servers on the network before starting.  If they hear one, they'll
disable themselves.  Others, stomp right ahead blindly.  If you are
doing this wan-port-trick at all, better to positively turn off the
unneeded DHCP server, I think, to avoid the ambiguity.  Too many cooks
in the kitchen, etc.

There are 500-umpteen ways of configuring networks that can (be made
to) work.  Some are more sane and less astonishing than others.

"Not such a good idea, IMHO.  The "access point" dhcp server is going
to be giving itself out as the default route, unless you can tell it
otherwise."

Russel - This is an incorrect understanding of how DHCP actually works. The
DHCP server is configured with various parameters such as: ip address
pools, subnet masks, dns servers, routers, etc. The dhclient.conf file is
where the DHCP client is configured to request and require specific
parameters such as routers.

 "request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
domain-name, domain-name-servers, domain-search, host-name,
dhcp6.name-servers, dhcp6.domain-search,
netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope, interface-mtu,
rfc3442-classless-static-routes, ntp-servers;
#require subnet-mask, domain-name-servers;"

With that being said, the standard issue dhcleint,conf file would request
routers from the DHCP server and would need to modified.

"Also, some embedded dhcp servers listen for other dhcp
servers on the network before starting.  If they hear one, they'll
disable themselves.  Others, stomp right ahead blindly.

I've been working with computer networks for 15 yrs and I have yet to see
this behavior. I realize standards, like DHCP, are not always implemented
thoroughly or correctly, but having multiple DHCP servers on the same
network is often used in failure scenarios. The only thing that requires is
a correct overlap configuration of ip addresses.

 "If you are doing this wan-port-trick at all, better to positively turn

unneeded DHCP server,I think, to avoid the ambiguity.  Too many cooks

This all sounds to

Message-ID: <CABWFOjs5a47jaVTqHzrxu0LST1e-8nWNksNS3gmZEg_LmhofQg@mail.gmail.com>

I have access to Linux machines and a couple of Windows 7
machines.  I'd like to know how this software

http://webEbenezer.net/misc/direct.tar.bz2  (*)

builds, especially on systems that I don't have like
Solaris, Android, Windows 8, etc.

A C++ compiler with support for the 2011 standard is
needed.  VS 11 might work, VS 12 works here.

There's a Readme file in the archive which tells about
the makefiles in the archive.  There's a separate
makefile for Windows. On Windows a library and one
executable are built.  On Linux the same library and
executable are built plus a second executable is built.

The file to download is 21,376 bytes at this time so
downloading it shouldn't take long.  On my Linux system
the library and two programs build in 7 seconds.  If
everything goes well, the downloading, tar xf direct.tar.bz2,
and building should take less than a minute.

I'd like to know how it builds on your system.  The only
warning I get with clang 3.3 is: warning: control may reach
end of non-void function.  If it doesn't build on your system,
I'll do what I can to fix that, including possibly installing
that system on one of my machines.

Feel free to keep/reuse the software if you like.  However,
two of the files in the archive are from another developer
and should only be used in conjunction with the rest of
the software.  Those files are quicklz.h and quicklz.cc.
See http://quicklz.com for more info.

Thank you in advance.

Let me tell you, I have.  And I'd be happy to introduce you to them.

I wouldn't swear to it, but I think dnsmasq might do the former out of
the box.  In any case, I know for certain I have seen this behavior
multiple times, enough to learn to watch out for it.  Looking back
through my notes, it might have been seen with a stock WRT54G and
another device with OpenWrt dnsmasq.

The Zhone/Paradyne DSL modems that Integra deploys are in the latter
category.  In fact, by default, they hand out leases over the entire
available address range (.2 through .254 in a /24).  They don't bother
to check whether the IP address is in use (e.g. by pinging) before
hand.  This makes trying to use static IPs on these networks highly
problematic. It is just a matter of time before the helpful DHCP
server cheerfully stomps on your carefully chosen IPaddr.  Just as a
capper, Integra refuses to provide a login to let you configure the
DSL modem yourself.  Which means, every trivial little change you
might want to make requires a support call.

Hi everyone.

I am currently looking for a Linux distribution to install on a new 
laptop and I'm evaluating two related but different distributions: 
Debian and Kubuntu, the KDE variant of Ubuntu. I am currently running 
the Debian testing distribution on an old laptop. I've done some 
research on the distinctions between Ubuntu and Debian, but I would like 
to gather some opinions from the community regarding their experiences 
with Ubuntu / Kubuntu and what sorts of differences I could expect to 
encounter transitioning from the Debian distribution to the Ubuntu / 
Kubuntu distribution.

Thanks in advance for your opinions and insights!

Russel => "Having to modify the client device means you have already
failed.  It is supposed to be "just works"."

"DHCP is built on a client-server model. DHCP allows but does not
require the configuration of client parameters not directly related to
the IP protocol."
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2131.txt


Russel => "The Zhone/Paradyne DSL modems that Integra deploys are in
the latter category.  In fact, by default, they hand out leases over
the entire available address range (.2 through .254 in a /24).
Russel => *They don't bother to check whether the IP address is in use
(e.g. by pinging) before hand.* This makes trying to use static IPs on
these networks highly problematic"

-- This behavior is not defined in the RFC.

"The client SHOULD perform a final check on the parameters (e.g., ARP
for allocated network address), and notes the duration of the lease
specified in the DHCPACK message.  At this point, the client is
configured.  If the client detects that the address is already in use
(e.g., through the use of ARP), the client MUST send a DHCPDECLINE
message to the server and restarts the configuration process."


"In "manual allocation", a client's IP address is assigned by the
network administrator, and DHCP is used simply to convey the assigned
address to the client."

-- In other words the Network Administrator is responsible for either
specifying specific ip addrs for specific hosts or carving out a pool
of ip addresses that will be manually configured and not include them
in the DHCP dynamically assigned ip address pool.

-- In summary, I realize that many of the consumer market products
don't implement the DHCP RFC completely or that some ISPs may change
the features and functions as they see fit. I just want to be clear
where the problem lies, which is not with DHCP itself as much as the
lack of understanding of how it works, how it's configured and how it
may or may not be implemented by a hardware vendor or ISP.

It *is* defined in the software that people have written and deployed,
however.  Which, in this case, is the important bit.

Just to reiterate, having two DHCP servers on the same network, where
there is one gateway to the intarwebs, is *not* what I would
recommend, particularly not to Rich.

Subject: [PLUG] Rescan for PS2 Mouse?
Message-ID: <520EA6F8.2000300@dicksteffens.com>

Is there a command line tool to rescan for a PS2 mouse?

Short version of story:

Old PS2 mouse on machine 1 died. Tried to replace it with a USB mouse, 
but cable too short. Swapped in another old PS2 mouse from machine 2 and 
moved the USB mouse to that machine.

Got a USB extension cord. Moved the USB mouse back to machine 1. Works fine.

Moved the PS2 mouse back to machine 2. Not recognized.

I know it will work if I reboot, but I'm hoping to be able to just run a 
command line program to find the PS2 mouse.

Dick,

   gpm is the tool you want. On Slackware it's '/etc/rc.d/rc.gpm restart'.
Translate that to the distribution you use.

That wasn't installed. But I found a help page that described installing 
it with apt-get. I did that, and ran it, but it didn't make any 
difference. Rather than spend a lot of time with it, I just rebooted and 
the PS2 mouse works as expected.

Thanks anyway.

If I remember correctly, PS/2 ports are not "hot-plug" like USB or
Firewire.  You really should NOT unplug/plug while the computer is
powered on.  That is one reason we've moved off special purpose ports
such as these.

Odd thing is that when I did this switch the first time it worked. Maybe 
it's because there was already a PS2 mouse on the machine to which I 
moved the PS2 mouse the first time. The second time, when I moved the 
PS2 mouse back to the other machine, there had been a power outage, and 
thus a reboot without a PS2 mouse connected.

Ed,

   Interesting. I've swapped trackballs and replaced the battery in the
new-ish wireless one with no issues. All have USB plugs but I use a
USB-to-PS/2 adapter which is plugged in the DIN socket on the rear of the
host.

+1

PS/2 are not "supposed" to be hot plugged/unplugged. It is likely that the
trouble you had was based in hardware (BIOS), not the operating system.
Some systems are/were more tolerant of doing this (probably a result of the
BIOS?).

Exactly: "new-ish" mice/KB that are USB and ship with an adaptor
autosense the interface.  So, if you leave the USB dongle connected and
just pull out the USB device, it "should" work ok since the mouse can
figure it out and the motherboard never knew that the device was
unplugged.  Same goes for swapping track balls or batteries: you do not
need to really disconnect to do that stuff (I never do).

Some newer motherboards are a bit smarter as well.

However, the PS/2 interface was not design for constant
plugging/unplugging and you can damage the the socket as well interface
electronics if you do.

This is a case of going back to first principles and the original design
spec.  What may work for a subset of hardware cannot be expected to work
generally.  it all depends on what the motherboard manufacturer did to
tweak the design.

BTW, gpm is not a mouse driver, just a server to allow cut/paste in CLI
apps when not running X.  In some cases it will cause problems when X
tries to load a mouse driver.

Yes, not odd at all.  To paraphrase slashdot, go to the wikipedia link

Message-ID: <521249E6.7080802@dicksteffens.com>

Any horror stories related to flash drives?

Those $20 Lenovo machines Kieth mentioned that are available at Eco 
Binary don't have an optical media drive. So installing an OS would need 
to be done with a flash drive (or some other way, but that's the one I'm 
aware of).

I'm looking at a SanDisk Cruzer 32 GB USB Flash Drive from Amazon.

http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Cruzer-Flash-Drive-SDCZ36-032G-AFFP/dp/B007JR532M/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1376928931&sr=8-3&keywords=flash+drive

There are two reviews that are somewhat contradictory. The first one 
says the thing is actually a 64 GB and he's happy with it.

The second one says the transfer rate is slow, and it hangs on him.

Any experience with these things (USB flash drives in general) for 
installing an OS?

Thanks.

Personally I stick with Kingston ... only had one problem with one, and 
Kingston RMA'd it with no hassle ... I have 4 Kingstons on my desk right now
     1 8GB
     2 32GB
     1 64GB
All of these are USB 2.0

No experience as yet with installing or running OS from flash drive ... 
soon, though, soon ... that won't help you right now, eh?

Transfer rate ... my personal experence ...
     Had an older Intel P4 ... everything USB was dog slow
     Got a newer Intel Quad-core i3-3220 ... USB moves pretty well

Hope that helps

Fred James

Disclaimer ... I have no connection whatsoever with Kingston, and I 
don't sell computer products of any kind.

The only thumb drive I've ever had go bad on me was an 8GB PNY unit.
OTOH, I have a couple of other PNYs that work just fine.  One of them
is the very first thumb drive I bought, with a whopping 256MB
capacity.  :-)  Most of my thumb drives Kensingtons, and I've never 
had any trouble with them.  I don't have any SanDisk thumb drives, so 
I can't say from personal experience how well they work.  I do have a
couple of microHD cards from them, and they work well enough.

I did just buy a new PNY 8GB drive (it was at the food checkout stand
at Fred Meyer :-) ), and I noticed something troubling -- the
connector shell is plastic, not metal.  Since the shell is both ground
and shielding, I don't consider that a good thing.  I'm sure it makes
the drive less expensive, but still.  The annoying thing is that you
can't tell this at the store.  The drive has a sleeve that slides up
to protect the connector when the drive's not in use, which of course
hides it.  I shant be buying any more of those.

I looked at the Amazon web page, and the reviews seem to be for the
entire line of that style of SanDisk thumb drives.  While most of the
reviews (and there are over 2000 of them) are positive, most of
them do note that the drive is slow.  It looks to me as if that whole
series of drives is slow.  From what I know of SanDisk's reputation,
it will probably work well.  Just very slowly.

I've never tried to use a thumb drive as an installation drive.  I
have used one as a "live OS" drive, and it worked nicely, so I assume
(HAH!) that it would work as an installation drive.  Since I have a
number of 2.5" hard drives, and the USB cases to put them in, I'd just
use one of them as an installation drive.  Or for that matter, I have
a portable USB DVD unit, if I really needed a DVD reader.

Hope this helps.

I use whatever I usually find in the bargain bin at Fry's Electronics
(Beaverton OR).  I use them for general "sneaker-netting" as well to
boot Slackware.

Lately, I've been picking up 8GB+ SDHC mini-SD cards (along with the
various size adapter cards). That way I just need to swap the card
between readers (Note: older <=4GB SD/MMC readers wont read larger
capacity SDHC cards >= 8GB so check specs.).

Price $1-$15 on sale depending on capacity (sometimes a 2 pack!). Note:
No distro boot media requires more than 4-8GB USB drive to hold the boot
image.  16BG or greater is overkill.

Brands I've used with no issues:
Sandisk
PNY
Toshiba
Duracell

As for the  SanDisk Cruzer reviews:
1. Check for true USB2.0 as opposed to USB 1.1
2. Writing is always slower that reading
3. I've found that Linux read/write speeds much faster than WinXP/7
4. Using the security function is SLOW. Not an issue in Linux (reformat).

I bought a SanDisk Cruzer once several years ago. It came with some
kind of software (called U2, if memory serves) that flashed a window on
your screen every time it was mounted, proclaiming the virtues of
SanDisk and how clever I was to have chosen it. It was impossible
to remove it, at least no one I consulted could come up with a way to
defeat it. Eventually I went to SanDisk's web site and discovered that
they had so many complaints from users that they made a web-based
removal utility. And it was not just me - once at the Clinic someone
had one of these, and luckily I had bookmarked the page for the removal
utility. 

Ever since I have avoided SanDisk. 

About a year and a half ago I was in Fry's where I spotted a 32 GB USB
3.0 thumb drive by Patriot. It was marked down to only $20, a decent
price even today. When I got it home I figured out why it was marked
down. They had formatted it NTFS instead of the usual FAT32. After a
quick reformat it worked fine. 

Before you give your money to Amazon check out Fry's because they
sometimes have deals like I found.

Thanks. Good to know about positive experiences with Kingston.

Okay. That confirms the feeling I was getting.

Great. Thanks for all the good ideas.

I just talked with the folks at Eco Binary and learned that the Lenovo 
boxes have 512 MB RAM and AMD Sempron 2.0 chips. Several of the 
recommendations I've found on various MythTV sites recommend Intel dual 
core processors. So I probably won't be getting one of those Lenovos. 
However, they said they will be getting more Lenovos out on the floor 
later in the week, and they might be a different configuration. I don't 
think I mentioned planning to build some Myth boxes.

I think I'll still look into using a USB flash drive for the install 
media, though, even though the box I install on might have an optical 
drive. Saves burning a DVD and can be reused.

One reason I'm going to Amazon is that I need something else from them 
and want to get the value of the order up over $25 to get the free 
shipping. (What I need is around $10, but the shipping is close to $9!)

Thanks for the info.

My desktop system doesn't like booting to random USB devices.  I have
to reset the BIOS for every drive (but only one at a time!), and it
loses that setting once the drive's been removed.  So I don't bother
with booting from USB, and use DVDs.  OTOH, I got tired of burning two
DVDs every time a new Fedora release came out.  (One for my 64-bit
desktop, and one for the 32-bit laptop.)  So I bought a pack of 5
DVD-RW disks, and haven't had to burn (in more ways than one) a DVD
for Fedora since.  CD-RW disks work nicely for the Live CDs, too.  A
bit spendy at the outset, but I'm on my fifth release of Fedora on the
same pair of disks, so I consider it money well spent.  Just a
thought.

You can don't have to enter the Setup screen and alter the boot device
priorities each time you plug in a new device if your BIOS supports
the BIOS Boot Specification (which it should, unless the system is
quite old).  When you first power-on your system, you should see
something similar to "Press F8 for BBS Popup".  (It may be Escape or
F5 or some other key, depending on how the vendor configured the
BIOS.)

The BBS "popup" menu presents a list of all bootable devices currently
available.

Nope, I don't get the BBS popup notification at all.  The Press DEL to
Setup shows up, of course, but not the other.  Obviously the desktop's
motherboard is a bit on the elderly side.  :-)  It's an Asus M2N-MX.

This doesn't show on my desktop machine, either.  I do get it on my
laptop, though (a Dell Inspiron 9300).

There may be a BIOS upgrade for your motherboard that would include
the boot menu feature.  BIOS upgrades are usually a bit of a hassle,
but it might be worth it in this case.  Unfortunately, the Asus web
has rather terse descriptions of the changes their BIOS updates
include.  No mention of BBS popups.

Message-ID: <5213B5A6.8050105@martinconsulting.com>

Dear Pluggers,

I'm soliciting opinions here.

My annual contract for a yellow pages listing is up for renewal. It's 
costing me over $400/year for some additional classifications and such.  
I also get a listing in their on-line yellow pages as part of the 
package.  I don't know that I've ever gotten work from any of it, and 
I'm inclined to drop it altogether.  What do you think?  If you are a 
business owner today, do you still find value in phone book listings?

TIA.

As a consumer I know it has been several years since I looked into the 
yellow pages for anything.

First time commenting here since signing up.

Coming from the perspective of a consumer, it's been years since I've
opened a phone book. I'll do a web search for whatever I'm looking for and
include the name of the town. Unless I'm looking for a specific place. Then
it's even easier.

Same here. As a customer, I can't remember when I last looked at a
phone book of any sort.

A business with even a basic static web site (and verifiable whois
record) hold more weight.

Brian,

   Many years ago I dropped my business phone book listing, then realized
that sometimes folks need to look up the number. Since (and before I dropped
it) I've had only the basic listing in a single category. I suppose that my
company can also be found in the various on-line 'yellow pages.'

   Depending on who your clients are and what services you provide it is
quite likely that advertising is a waste of your money. Just yesterday I got
a call from a salesman for the Society of Mining Engineers wanting to sell
me a listing in the consultants section of their directory. It took a while
before he understood that I know from experiences with ads in various mining
publications, and having a listing for more than 15 years at info-mine.com,
with none of them bringing in business that no one hires consultants from
such sources.

   Think of this: would you pick a physician or lawyer from a yellow pages
listing, or would you solicit referrals from folks you know? If your
business is like that of other professional service providers than the
yellow pages will do you no good.

   When I'm traveling I often use the phone book in the hotel room to find a
restaurant or retailer.

You've asked a very biased group, and gotten the expected response.

While I do think phone books are on the decline, if you had asked random
people on the street, I think you would see a little more use than here on
an online Linux forum.

What really matters is who your intended audience is. I don't even know
what you do, but it's possible you might get some business from a phone
book. Though if I were running a business, I would just do the basic
listing and not all the extra ads. I don't even know what that would cost,
but it would all have to be weighed against the risk of missing out on the
business.

These listings not only don't bring work, they are used by others to
call you to sell you stuff.  When the Hillsboro Chamber of Commerce
published the Oregon High Tech Directory, I was in there (for free),
and all I got was calls from office supply stores and temp agencies.
I had to jump through hoops to get OUT of the directory.   

A $400/y listing demonstrates to vendors that you have excess money,
a problem they would be glad to help you with.

Instead of spending the money that way, consider going to your ten
favorite customers, and offer a free hour of your time in return
for 20 minutes of their time, so they can tell you how they found
you and why they picked you instead of somebody else.  Then invest
in the channels they used, and look for more customers like them.

Wild idea:  Imagine finding some 20 pocket wall brochure racks,
and some other consultants who offer other kinds of computer
services.  Populate the rack with brochures, then go to independent
computer stores and ask for wall space.  The sell?  Store owners
can concentrate on selling stuff, not answering complicated
questions for free.  People coming into the store looking for
brochures may also buy something.  etc.  If you do this right,
it will increase their sales and save them time.  Don't pay for
the space, but offer some quid pro quo (time or money) for the
pamplets that turn into paying gigs.

You and your colleagues will spend time going to the stores and
replenishing the racks - but that is your chance to learn about
opportunities from the store owners.  People are more likely to
trust the people they see a lot.

I don't know what business you are in, but if you are looking for certain
types of consumers you might consider Angie's List. I don't know how much
it costs, but I find it much more useful than the yellow pages. BTW, lots
of doctors advertise on Angie's List since it has all the personal
recommendations on that list. You can coupon through Angie's List, so you
will now exactly how many customers the list brings in. You can link the
listing to your web site.

Kieth has a great idea, but you may meet some resistance. The computer
stores may not want potential liability of "recommending" someone they do
not know. Home Depot use to do exactly what you suggest - they had a board
where handymen and handywomen could advertise their services. The employees
knew a lot of these folks so they were a good source of personal
recommendations. Home Depot took out the board and stopped all the
recommendations from the employees. There was too much potential liability
for Home Depot to recommend a local handyman.


Just my 2 cents.

That is a good point - but then, anything Home Despot does comes with
liability, because they have a lot of assets, and with big risks, because
they are too large and bureaucratic to develop one-on-one relationships
with the people they might recommend.  

Brian does computer consulting - the liabilities associated with what
he does are hard to reassign, and if he has errors and omissions
insurance, that is the deep pockets, not most computer stores or owners.
Sue a computer store, and you end up with what's in the till and a
bunch of rapidly depreciating store stock.  So, Fry's and Best Buy
might be off the list, but many of the small places might appreciate
the networking opportunities Brian and his colleagues provide,
competent advice, etc.  There might be other help they could provide
the store owners, like testing and recommendations for hardware that
works well with linux.

Brochures and business cards may also be distributed by satisfied
clients themselves.  Sometimes, extra business cards left with
clients get passed on to the client's associates.

Subject: [PLUG] Digital cameras with wifi
Message-ID: <521542FF.9030408@zenlinux.com>

Hi all,

I was in the market for a P&S digital camera recently and was surprised 
to find that you can now get cameras with built-in WiFi for around 
$150-200. The Sony WX80 I picked up has it, and of course has a 
proprietary software app that works automatically with Windows and OS X, 
Android and iOS.

Now, aside from the fact that I likely shot myself in the foot by buying 
a Sony device in the first place, I was wondering if anyone knew what 
protocol these cameras (Sonys and others) use to identify and transfer 
files to computers on the wireless LAN.

I tried doing a port scan of the Windows machine running the Sony app, 
but came up with nothing. The box says the camera is also DLNA 
certified, and I wonder if that may also play a role.

It's generally not a huge hardship to transfer the files over USB, but 
I'm curious, and haven't run into any promising search results on the 
web yet.

Scott

 From the Sony manual:
"You cannot transfer images recorded on the internal memory using the
Wi-Fifunction (DSC-WX80/WX200"

Huh? I've tested this and it works just fine with the Sony software 
running in a WinXP VM.

The camera itself does have 48 MB of flash storage that's possible to 
use to take a few photos if you don't have an SD card installed. My 
guess is it's referring to that as internal memory.

I thought I had posted to the list about all the icons and programs
disappearing, yet the programs are still running. If I did I must have
deleted the message and responses from my inbox.

At the Clinic Keith attempted to figure out what was going on, so I
thought I ought to tell the list what the problem was. It turns out
that the scroll wheel on my mouse (which doubles as the
middle mouse button) occasionally takes it into its little rodent head
that, instead of scrolling, it ought to send Ctrl-Alt-arrow. I have
only two workspaces set up, and I never use the other one but, sure
enough, when everything disappeared this evening I tried Ctrl-Alt-arrow
and, sure enough, everything was back.

The mouse is a wireless USB mouse, Dynex brand, from Best Buy. On the
back it says "Made in China."

If you only use one workspace shouldn't you be able to set the number of 
workspaces to one? Then there wouldn't be another workspace to which to 
go. And if you ever needed more workspaces you could change the setting 
again.

That already occurred to me. But I keep thinking that I should get used
to using more than one workspace. Real Linux people do. I assume they
find some advantage to doing so.

I find that I use a second workspace for running Virtual Box which runs 
a lightly used server connected to my DVR. I don't need to have a button 
for it showing on the active workspace, so I keep it on a second 
workspace. That's on one machine. I rarely use a second workspace on my 
other three machines.

Yeah, it works for them. 
But if you don't need it and you get along fine then don't do it.
Real Linux people do what works for them.

I think this is normal behavior for XFCE.  Under CentOS 6.4 with xfce4, 
when the pointer is on the root window, the scroll wheel will either 
increment or decrement the active workspace number.

Oh. The desktop. 

Since I never run anything full screen there is always a bit of the
desktop visible somewhere. So I'm just clumsy, trying to scroll in a
window when I'm not in a window. 

The Chinese are exonerated.

I like using the multiple workspace things when I'm on an ubuntu
desktop (12.04 gnome-session-fallback, no unity crap here), I have a
multi-tab terminal full-screen in one, firefox full-screen on another,
chrome full-screen on another, and the fourth one is available for
random other things, like for when i need to see icons and stuff on
the desktop. ;-)

The funny thing is, i'm actually more productive when I have a
mish-mash of overlapping xterm and emacs windows on my custom-sawfish
debian desktop, partly because i can see multiple things at the same
time and don't forget them as I switch between workspaces.

After much consideration I decided to keep my two workspaces. Instead
of deleting one of the workspaces I decided to disable this feature of
the scroll wheel. It took forever to find the setting, but it was in
Settings Manager > Window Manager Tweaks.

Thanks again for clarifying the source of my problem. I would never
have figured this out without your input. :)

Subject: [PLUG] Ethernet Issues on Portables
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1308241118450.13801@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'm looking for ideas from those more expert on networking on what I've overlooked
in this situation.

   We have two portables here: a Dell Latitude which has never had any issues
connecting to the LAN via ethernet or to external networks wirelessly, and a
Sony Vaio which has had wireless connectivity issues with each distribution
upgrade. Today, both have issues connecting on the LAN via ethernet.

   I'll the problem with the Dell but the Sony's issues are the same. And
I've tried this on two different ethernet connections.

   After booting there are no eth0 routes, broadcast or default and
/etc/resolv.conf has been cleaned out. After resetting /etc/resolv.conf and
manually adding broadcast and default routes for eth0 I try running
'ifconfig eth0 up' but that does not bring up a running interface. Thinking
that I need to restart the networking daemon, I run '/etc/rc.d/rc.inetd
restart' without resolving the problem. (The details for eth0 and the
default gateway for eth0 are in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf which should be read
by rc.inetd when it's started.)

   Not before having such uncooperative behavior from a portable I'm at a
loss what to do. All the obvious possibilities: resolv.conf, routing table,
networking daemon, and configuring the interface do not make a difference.
Where else should I look? And, what could possibly remove routes and
resolv.conf contents when the system is shut down or the cat5 cable
disconnected?

   UPDATE: The Sony seems to have cured itself; my friend is working with it
now and has no issues connecting to the 'Net. I'm puzzled but pleased.

   The Dell continues to behave strangely. For reasons beyond my knowledge,
rc.inet1.conf lost the NO in the line 'use dhcp' for eth0. That's why
resolv.conf was constantly being emptied. I modified the network
configuration file and upon rebooting the resolv.conf contents were
retained. But, for some (again) unknown reason, rc.inetd is not being run so
there is no network deamon and no routes. Manually running
/etc/rc.d/rc.inetd start restored the routes. If need be, I can duplicate
that line in rc.local. It would be nice to learn why it's not being run
during the boot process.

   This still leaves one issue that I have not been able to resolve despite
searching the Web for insights: eth0 has no carrier. I don't know where that
is controlled and have not found an applicable reference to someone else
solving this issue.

I would love to see the talk.   I have a lot of openvpn links
going, but I'm sure they could be designed more effectively.

---

I would also love to see a PLUG server set up as an OpenVPN
"hub" for the clinic, along with some newbie-level instructions
for temporarily connecting home machines to it.

Rather than people dragging desktops to the clinic, they could
connect their machines to the internet, and run an OpenVPN link
to this hypothetical hub machine, and we could connect from 
the clinic back through the tunnel to their machine for the
duration of the clinic.  

There are security concerns, of course, and we would not want
to leave the connections live when the clinic was not operating.
We would need wrappers to help newbies turn the tunnel on and off.

Update...

I reached out to Mr. IPv6 Ted Mitlesteadt and he's checking his
schedule. Paul may rock pfSense for us and Mike Faunce (you know him as
MemoryTime) is open to rocking FOG server (LAN system cloning).

Can't wait!

Rich - "no carrier" simply means there is no Ethernet signal for which to
carry data over. It's generally indicative of a physical layer issue, bad
cable, port nic, etc. However, if you've got a link light on both ends of
the Ethernet cable then all is well at the physical layer.

However, when you combine that with the rc.inetd  script not being run it
makes me wonder if you have the wrong nic driver/module. The reason I say
this is because if you look at the  rc.inet1.conf script, it will do
nothing if the nic kernel driver is not loaded.

# Function to bring up a network interface.  If the interface is #
already up or does not yet exist (perhaps because the kernel driver #
is not loaded yet), do nothing.

When I push the button on my DVD writer the light goes on, but the 
drawer doesn't open. I ran:

sudo lshw -html > ~/Desktop/hardware.html

and see:

------------------------------

So I'm assuming that the problem must be with the drawer itself. Has 
anyone ever seen this before? Any recommendations on what to do about it?

I'm assuming you've rebooted, to eliminate the possibility of confused software? This would be a complete power down reboot, not a restart.

I've resolved several stuck drives just by power cycling them.

Just tried it. Same results. The light comes on for several seconds and 
then goes out. The drawer doesn't open.

You can use a paper clip to open it manually or run 'eject' from the
command line. Then try blowing canned air into it, or vacuuming it.
Occasionally stuff gets jammed in the mechanism or they need a tiny bit
of lube. They are not so complicated mechanically and it is possible to
dissemble them. On desktops there is often a pass though button that
doesn't always engage properly.

The high-tech tool for this is the paper clip. One one side of the Open
button or the other there is always a tiny hole, just wide enough to
admit a paper clip bent open. Sometimes you have to peer carefully to
see the hole, but I've never seen an optical drive without one. 

Once you get the drive open you can investigate what might have caused
it to get stuck. In my experience some drives just hang occasionally
without any apparent reason. That is, I'm sure there is a reason, but
armed with my trusty paper clip I've never found it worth the effort to
figure it out.

One nice thing about this tower is that it fits nicely under my desk. 
One unfortunate thing about this tower is that I have to pull it out 
from under the desk to work on it. So, I'll try the paper clip after 
lunch. Meanwhile ...

Googling that error message turned up:

(Back from lunch.)

I tried opening the drawer with a paper clip. That was successful. So, I 
put a blank CD in, manually closed the door, fired up Brasero only to be 
told that there is "No disc available". Now I'm wondering if it's 
possible a cable isn't firmly seated - seated enough to show that the 
drive is present and turn on the light, but not seated firmly enough to 
cause the drawer to open when told to. That sounds a little lame, but 
it's what comes to mind.

I don't know if it really mattered, or it the machine just responded 
like the workers in the Westinghouse studies, but I decided to move the 
DVD drive down one level to an unused bay, thinking that just possibly 
the top bay was too snug for the drive. The SATA data cable was hard to 
remove, but it came out eventually and, after moving the drive, went 
back in without complaint.

After buttoning up the box and pushing the power button I pushed the 
eject button. The door opened. I pushed the button again and the drawer 
closed.

Once booted I pushed the button again, the drawer opened, and I put in a 
blank DVD. I fired up Brasero and burned a DVD.

The DVD is now being used to install Mythbuntu 12.04.2 on a recently 
acquired (hand-me-down) Toshiba Satellite. The laptop has a dual core 64 
bit Intel processor, but only 1 GB of RAM. We'll see if Mythbuntu runs 
any better than the previous attempt to run 64 bit Ubuntu 12.04. The 
goal here isn't so much to use this laptop as part of my Myth system -- 
as yet to be assembled -- but to see if the distro will run well in a 
light memory environment. I know I can upgrade the RAM to 2 GB, but the 
screen has damage on the right side -- almost 1/4 is unusable. However, 
the external VGA port works just fine on one of my extra monitors, so 
I'll play with it some.

Thanks for all the ideas on how to get the drive drawer open.
