In my effort to become a senile old koot, I wish this to read as a 
"SAFE" 4th of July.

I hear the bombs falling already.

Keeping it on topic though, I am pleased to report that ZFS is a logical 
conclusion on many fronts and when you need things like cache devices, 
it is for good reason.

In a way... it's like a solid bridge over a canyon. Don't go over the

Subject: [PLUG] Help - Gnome died after Update/Upgrade
Message-ID: <CAEqej2Nxz=VTbE-4gXxXWJB0P6xG2KUEwnphaERddmBe=8YbPg@mail.gmail.com>

I have been running Debian testing on my laptop for several years. I
performed a "routine" update/upgrade on Sunday, and I seem to have lost
gnome. At first, I could not log in, but I got that fixed. However, when I
log in, all I get is my wallpaper. No favorites on the left, no window
docks (not sure of the terminology here) on the right, no taskbar at the
top, etc. Just a wall paper. I also get an error message "No system tray
detected, unable to start". However, I traced that back to an hp printer
service, so I don't think it is relevant.

I have tried uninstalling/installing gnome, but no change. I tried creating
an new user and logging in with that user, and I get the same situation -
but the default wall paper and not my personal one. I have looked through
the 'net to find solutions, and I am not getting anywhere.

I cannot find any error messages to work with in aptitude, apt, gdm, Xorg,
and dmesg. I can ssh into the box from my tablet with no problem.

Please let me know how to fix this issue.....I need my laptop back!!

Thanks,

Mark

Multiple people seem to have this issue, including me. The problem is
solved in gnome-shell from unstable, you can either wait until it
migrates to testing (in 1 or 2 days I guess, judging from the QA page
[1]) or you can install from unstable with "aptitude install -t unstable
gnome-shell" (no quotes). Make sure you have unstable in your
sources.list file. Just be careful not to upgrade your whole system to
unstable, but only that package.

It worked for me!

Thomas - My apologies for posting to the plug-jobs email list. I typed plug
into the To field, clicked the drop down email address menu in gmail and
fired.

Thank you all for your words of wisdom, tools, and commands.

I used Austin's command to determine that /var and /var/log were the two
largest users of hard drive space. I found 3 1GB log files (syslog,
kernel.log, and messages). I archived them and moved them into /home.

I deleted those logs, but it wasn't until after a reboot that "df -h"
reported 3.9 GBs free in "/".

On my own system and other commercial systems I'm use to having separate
/usr /var and /tmp dirs that way if those dirs fill up, you still have a
functional system while you sort out the disk space.

I  guess what I didn't and still don't understand is that my friend's
system has a 400 GB drive and only 200 GB was used by /home by all 9.2 GB
of "/" was being used.

So am I to understand that when you don't have a separate /usr /var/ and
/tmp dirs that all of those files are stored in "/" ?

Also, what's interesting to me is that a non-custom partition table only
allocates 10 GB for everything that doesn't get stored in /home. Even on a
430 GB hard drive. Am I understanding that correctly?

Dumb question time. I don't suppose there's a way to symlink those dirs to
a space in the /home dir to avoid this problem in the future is there?

Thanks again for all of your help!

Cheers,

Mike

On Linux, files are not truly "deleted" until all references to them are
removed - which includes processes that have them open. These files would
be open by the logging process, usually syslog. You can see this using
something like lsof | grep syslog.conf. This is why the space was not freed
until after rebooting.

This would be a smart thing to do.

This is standard practice. I don't know why, but I see it everywhere and it
bugs me as much as it does you. It does normally work - log files are not
normally allowed to reach 1gb in size. They are supposed to be
automatically archived and old ones deleted. You should probably look into
why that's not happening.

Yes, you can do this. Simply mv /var /home/var and then ln -s /home/var
/var, and reboot. Even better would be to create a new partition in the
empty (unused) space on the drive, and mount it on /var. You don't really
need to do this for /usr or /tmp.

Message-ID: <51D490E8.9060901@dicksteffens.com>

This morning Google Earth decided to give me an error message. Googling, 
I found that other experienced the same thing with GE 6 on Ubuntu 12.04. 
Their solution was to upgrade to GE 7. I did that and found that the 
problem went away. But upgrade is really the wrong term here. I have 
both 6 and 7 installed. How do I uninstall 6? If I right-click on the 
.deb file it offers to "Open with Ubuntu Software Center." But I'm only 
given the option to reinstall. The file menu of Ubuntu Software Center 
has the option Remove grayed out.

Thanks.

   If worst comes to worst, su (or sudo) to root and use find / -name
google-earth (or GoogleEarth for earlier versions) and manually remove all
files, then re-install version 7.

   My copy of 6.x suddenly failed and when I upgraded to 7.x it does not
display the graphic backgrounds. Haven't figured that one out yet. PITA, eh?

And then perhaps something like this, to remove it:

dpkg --purge google-earth6

If "google-earth6" were the package name.

I ran:

dpkg --purge googleearth
dpkg --purge googleearth-package

Now I have only one entry in the applications menu, and it is the 
correct one -- GE 7. Fortunately I'm not particularly interested in the 
photos attached to GE, since I only get a blank window when I click on 
one of those icons. This was mentioned by others in the Googling I did 
earlier.

Thanks to all for the assistance.

Suddenly my Mint Xfce desktop was running slow. After a bit of
sleuthing I discovered that console-kit-daemon was taking over a GB of
RAM (the computer has two GB). The GUI task manager refused to kill it,
as did top, but I was finally able to nuke it with sudo kill and the
PID number. I did not reboot and the computer runs normally now without
it.

According to what Google provides me console-kit-daemon is deprecated
and no longer necessary. So why was it even running? And if it is
needed, why does it need a GB of RAM? Should I be filing a bug report?

I have experienced this as well. though on a non-GUI system, the only
symptom was that the log file would grow large. I uninstalled it with no
noticeable side effects.

feel free to file a bug; I would guess it would be closed as a duplicate.

Subject: [PLUG] Screwy Mouse Response
Message-ID: <51D5A9F5.5030905@dicksteffens.com>

I'm getting a screwy lack of control of the mouse this morning. It's 
working okay at the moment, but frequently I'll get a situation where 
various things can happen. I say that because I'm not sure exactly 
what's going on. One of the things that seems to happen is that the 
mouse cursor doesn't track with the mouse movement, but at the same 
time, if I drag over something it will be selected and acted upon. For 
example, while I was trying to get a response to moving the mouse it 
seems that I dragged over the icon to start Google Earth, and it 
started. Also, I had a LiberOffice Writer document open, and opened a 
LibreOffice spreadsheet. As I moved the cursor over the spreadsheet, all 
of a sudden that area of the spreadsheet was selected, copied, and then 
pasted into the LO Writer document. Weird.

After a couple of minutes things settle down and I can again move the 
mouse and have the mouse cursor track said movement. I tried rebooting 
to the next most recent version of Ubuntu 12.04, (was 28 something, now 
25 something) but that didn't take away the problem.

The only guess -- and it may just be coincidence -- is that this seems 
to have occurred after upgrading to Google Earth 7. I wouldn't expect 
that to matter, though.

Has anybody else using Ubuntu 12.04 experienced anything like this?

I'll do that. But I'm not sure that's it. Another thing that I didn't

Looks like that may have been the problem. I switched mice and haven't 
had a problem with it since.

Thanks for the pointer.

That being said, if you did not completely shut down the computers and unplug the original mouse during your testing, it's possible that there was simply an error in the mouse, and that it needed to be "hard booted" so to speak. 

If you did reboot completely to a shutdown, then disregard. :)

No. The only time I unplugged the mouse was when I shut down to swap it 
out with the "new" one. The old mouse is pretty old. It's a PS2. The 
"new" mouse is still several years old, but it's a USB. I do need to go 
get another mouse, since I use this USB mouse on another machine. I also 
need to get a USB extension cord for it to work better with my desk 
setup. I guess I should try the old mouse again and see if it is what 
needed the hard boot.

Bind mounts are useful in this situation, to avoid having symlinks
around 
(so things show up with their proper path).
  
Add this to /etc/fstab

 /home/var         /var        bind        defaults,bind    0 0

Then var will appear to be a proper directory in / (just as if it was on
its own partition) 
even though its actually elsewhere.

Subject: [PLUG] No movies for me tonight
Message-ID: <20130708221329.3b280c82@Devil8>

I use a 32GB Patriot USB3 drive (formatted FAT32) to transfer files from
my laptop (Fedora 16, x86_64) to my desktop (Mint-Xfce, recent new
install). I have never had a problem until tonight. I unmounted the
Patriot from the laptop, removed it, and inserted it into the desktop.
The desktop sees it (label "Patriot"), but refused to mount it because
I do not have permission. I never needed permission before, but
apparently suddenly now I do.

I cannot mount it manually using sudo from the command line because I
do not know what its device name is. How can I figure out what its
device name is?

More importantly, why would my desktop suddenly demand permission to
mount this device?

The lsblk(8) command should tell you what the device name is.  I
_think_ Palimpsest will, too, if you want a GUI command.  (It's
been a long time since I used it.)

I don't know.  Has anything been changed recently?  Software
upgrades can be problematic at times.

Brilliant! Turns out it was SDE1. Now happily mounted.

There have been no upgrades for a long time. However, I have been
having issues with Xfce on my laptop. There is a panel widget "Places"
that I have come to rely on. On my laptop (where mounting the Patriot
drive is not a problem) the Places widget insisted on opening locations
with Nautilus instead of the Xfce default, Thunar. In desperation I
recently uninstalled Nautilus, which caused Places to open locations
with Konqueror (KDE is also installed on this computer, although I
never log in to it). The problem may be related to these actions, but
why that should affect the desktop computer is beyond me.

Sounds like either something changed you user's permissions for
hotplugging, or, changed a udev rule. Typically, to automount USB
drives, you need to be part of the 'plugdev' group.

There is also a battle over udisk vs udisk2 so check to make sure these
don't conflict, corrupted, or were changed:

/lib/udev/rules.d/80-udisks.rules
/lib/udev/rules.d/80-udisks2.rules

I don't use any widgets but do run Xfce 4.10.  Thunar sees the
automounted USB drives just fine.

Have fun.

   I'd like some insights from you folks who know Web applications from the
server and client ends. My friend has javascript enabled in firefox and
chrome but facebook (and another site or two) either do not recognize this
or, perhaps, are using js features not in the version installed on her
computer.

   I thought that js was a server-side only language. What does it do on the
client side? It would be nice to resolve this issue sooner rather than
later.

Actually, no, JavaScript has been predominantly a client-side language
since it's inception.  It was Netscape who invented it, afterall, and
it's purpose has been to make web pages dynamic.

Note that Java and JavaScript are two completely different languages.

Use of JavaScript on the server has never been hugely popular, though
it has always been there, waxing and waning depending on what
frameworks support it.  Lately it has been waxing.

Tim,

   You're right: I should have recognized it's origins on the client since I
knew it was invented at Netscape.

   So, it's likely that the server (particularly facebook's) wants
capabilities in js not found in the version installed with Slackware-14.0 or
just does not work with the installed firefox version (which has been
upgraded a couple of times).

   Turns out the problem(s) go away with chrome so she's happy. Ergo, so am
I.

Thanks,

Rich

For want of a speaker, conflicting scheduling, gorgeous weather and 
OSCON upon us, I say we celebrate PLUG Advanced Topics in our own, 
unique ways. I highly suggest you all try to drop into the upcoming 
Community Leadership Summit and OSCON because they offer just about the 
best bang for the buck (often zero) anywhere. You can also pay sessions 
and tutorials. Don't miss the best hallway track on the planet.

Are any PLUGgers planning on attending the expo hall "booth crawl" on
Wednesday evening?

Will there be a PLUG booth?  I recall some discussion about a banner

Just to provide another datum, Firefox on OpenSUSE (multiple versions of 
both) has been giving me javascript problems for years, enough so that I 
have to use Opera for some websites.

I have Firefox on a Windows machine at work, and it's kind of flaky there, 
also.

Yes there will be a PLUG booth, and I will be the main man to man it,
although occasional help will be appreciated.

As for the banner, the artwork was sent to Michael yesterday, but I
haven't heard back from him. I will print some fliers as well.

Subject: [PLUG] Post to FTP server from soft real-time C program
Message-ID: <51E6CF76.3060902@pacifier.com>

A customer wants some data out of one of my optimization / control 
systems. They would like me to post it to a FTP server that will be 
added to the LAN.

My machine is Linux X86 running on PC hardware. It is a soft real-time 
application in a distributed processing system (6 ea. 6 core machines). 
The tasks are distributed and results collected from all the helper 
cores over the LAN. 3D imaging data and digital I/O also goes through 
the LAN, so the LAN isn't idle. It would be best if I could come up with 
something that would not hog bandwidth, but it absolutely can not block 
in my C program. I am currently making use of a couple threads in my C 
program, so another thread is a possibility. How would you send a few 
small files / minute via FTP?

Thanks in advance for your suggestions,
Wayne

I would have the code dump the files to disk, and then FTP them later via
script run from cron.

Subject: [PLUG] 19" computer racks
Message-ID: <CAMmm3r6BRME0t5_d5iK1_oSzrCBtEVTdmc+4TKP6P--WDjz1ug@mail.gmail.com>

Own a piece of PLUG history!

I need to get rid of two 19" computer racks, one of which held the servers
that hosted the PLUG lists and web site until the move a few months ago.
Scrappers are offering to take them, but I would rather they go to someone
who will reuse them as computer racks.

One is a 6' 4-post cabinet with a metal back door and a home-made dark
plexiglass front door and one is a 4' 2-post rack (it's steel so it's heavy
enough to be used w/o mounting to the floor). There are also some shelves
and a rack-mountable fan unit.

The catch is that whoever wants them will have to load and transport them
themselves; I cannot do that. (I offered them to Free Geek with that
condition but have not heard back; otherwise I would have just taken them
to the donation drop-off.)

Please contact me off-list if you are interested. I am in training today
and tomorrow but will check my e-mail periodically. If they are not claimed
by this weekend I will probably have to scrap them.

Michael,

   Nothing. I've tried various header_checks and body_checks with postfix and
this junk keeps escaping into my inbox. Can the From: and Subject: lines of
headers be obfuscated to avoid detection?

   If you find a solution, please share it!

Subject: [PLUG] Projection Screen Available
Message-ID: <51E6E564.4050006@dicksteffens.com>

Would PLUG, or any PLUG member be interested in a DaLite 50" lenticular 
projection screen which is built with a tripod stand? Circa 1980 +/- a 
couple of years, but not used for probably 10 or more years.

Some of you younger folks may not have seen these in use, but many of us 
will remember Dad taking lots of photographs with a camera that used a 
roll of film coated with light sensitive chemicals to record the picture 
instead of SD cards. Then, once the film had gone through a process they 
called development, where the chemicals on the film had been treated so 
that they were no longer sensitive to changes in light, and the film had 
been cut into individual images and mounted in cardboard holders, Dad 
would haul out a device called a slide projector, which is similar in 
function to a video projector. He'd also haul out one of these 
projection screens and set it up across the room from the slide 
projector. Then the family would be subject to an evening of reliving 
the vacation with photos that often had thumbs in the frame, and other 
fun stuff which may or may not still be happening.

Anyway, I have a screen, but do not foresee ever getting a video 
projector. The slide projector went to Goodwill several weeks ago. For 
whatever reason, the screen was not with the projector at that time. So, 
before the screen rejoins the projector, I want to offer it to the good 
of the order, or to one of the orderlies.

I'll be at the Clinic this Sunday and will have it in the car, should 
anyone want to take advantage of this one time offer.

By the way, the expected donation for this excellent screen is $0.

I use curlftpfs (a spin of fuse) where I have to
backup some files to a Windows share (CFS).

To automate the connection (without putting too much work/research into 
it) I had to reply on the .netrc file a security issue for some.

recind the forehead slap.  It is a substring match and you don't need to spec the full line.

hmmm yeah probably. in light of rich's reply, I'd be looking deeper to see
what the actual bits are that wind up displaying to your screen; the two
may not match. it could be something tricksy like "Dr. O[non-printable

wes,

   I've assumed that the messages that pass the postfix UCE filters do have
something like unprintable characters inserted just for that purpose. Is
there a tool that will show these characters? I use alpine as my MUA and it
does a good job on most html-formatted messages extracting the text but I
haven't found how to examine the messages more deeply.

Thanks,

Rich

Assuming that is 50" x 50" (not diagonal), I have a similar 
DaLite, and I can attest that they are well made and useful.
I use mine when I make presentations in the area, and have
also used it for backyard movie night (someday we may do a
bicycle-in theater).

The screens can also be useful for crude outdoor surveying;
they reflect the line from a laser level a whole lot better
than a wooden stake, good for first pass measurements.

Some of the older DaLites have a glass-sphere-and-glue rather
than a reflective plastic surface; those are unrepairable,
perhaps repurposable as canvases for temporary art projects if
you scrape off enough of the loose and discolored sand first.

if you can figure out which file contains the email, you can use vi to read

Firefox on Fedora 18 an 19 and MacOSX 10.6(?)  no problems.

YMMV, it seems.

Procmail recipes conditions are "and"ed together, not "or"ed.  All of the
above conditions would have to be true for the recipe to fire.  See:
http://www.perlcode.org/tutorials/procmail/proctut/proctip2.pod

Two of the above conditions, the first and last, will fail to match if the
email you're referring to is the same as:
http://spamavert.com/mail/original/kj6bz/90380296


It's pretty easy to test procmail recipes on the command line.  Assuming
you have a minimal recipe file at ~/procmail-test/recipe-test.rc:

MAILDIR=.
DEFAULT=$MAILDIR/inbox
VERBOSE=on
SHELL=/bin/sh

:0
* ^From:.*Feed Blaster
* ^From:.*Oz.*New
* Dr.*Oz
* ^From:.*Dr.*Oz
* ^From:.*DrOz
$MAILDIR/spam


Then you should be able to run the procmail command with "-m
recipe-test.rc" and pipe any spam emails to it:
$> cd ~/procmail-test
$> procmail -m recipe-test.rc < doz.txt
...
procmail: No match on "^From:.*Feed Blaster"
procmail: Locking "./inbox.lock"
procmail: Opening "./inbox"
...

With the following conditions:
:0
* ^From:.*Oz.*New
* Dr.*Oz
* ^From:.*Dr.*Oz
$MAILDIR/spam

$> procmail -m recipe-test.rc < doz.txt
...
procmail: Match on "^From:.*Oz.*New"
procmail: Match on "Dr.*Oz"
procmail: Match on "^From:.*Dr.*Oz"
procmail: Assigning "LASTFOLDER=./spam"
procmail: Opening "./spam"
...


Hope that helps.

Does the 4post cabinet have square or round holes?  If square, I?m interested, but I wouldn?t be able to pick it up until Mon.

They're round holes, but they're not threaded -- they require clips
and there are some on it.

Here are some pics:

Is it common to find rackmount computer racks that don't have threaded
holes?  This makes no sense to me.

Yes... especially on 4-post racks. All of our 4-post racks at work require
the cage nuts. I've never seen a 2-post rack that uses them, but I'm sure
they exist. I'm not very familiar with the round unthreaded holes that this
rack apparently has though.

Most have square holes (as earlier poster had asked about) that require
"cage nuts" (nuts housed in a frame that can be clipped into the square
holes... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cage_nut). "Normal" rack bolts then
screw into the cage nuts to secure everything in place. Cage nuts can be
purchased easily/affordably just about anywhere that sells corporate-class
computer equipment/furnishings (such as equipment/server racks).

The ones I've seen with round, unthreaded holes are intended to use "snap in" shelves and computer slides. Sometimes, this is a way to ensure 'lock in' so you have to buy the parts from the original vendor. 

The square hole w/cage nuts, or threaded holes are more standard.

Good to know.  The rackmount standard is no longer quite so standard.  I'll
be more careful when discussing, & recommending rackmount with folks.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux Clinic OSCON 2013 edition
Message-ID: <20130720043124.GA25858@gate.kl-ic.com>

In July 2012, we told the history of the Linux Clinic, from
its founding in a Palo Alto garage in 1938 (and renamed
Hewlett Packard) through the construction of the Oregon
Linux Clinic Center, renamed the Oregon Convention Center
when we moved to Free Geek at 1731 SE 10th Ave.

The saga continues;  over the past year, PLUG has put on a
dozen Linux Clinics, while Tim O'Reilly managed to put on
only one OSCON.  We help people with distros, installs, 
application debugging, while OSCON just has keynotes,
lectures, and closet-filling swag.  We will get a whole 
clinic done from 1 to 5 PM on Sunday July 21, while OSCON
needs a whole week.  Indeed, many people leave OSCON with
the same old Apple or Microsoft software on their laptop,
while we won't let you out of the building without some
kind of Linux or BSD on yours. 

Keyboards and screens for your desktop?  We've got 'em, you
probably can't bring your desktop into the convention center
without hassles from security.  The convention center has
the same free wifi that we've got, but they split it up
among thousands of people, instead of a dozen or so.  And
we've also got wired ethernet, just the thing when NSA
spooks are lurking outside with Tempest scanners.

Cookies?  Ice cream?  Frankly, OSCON has us beat there, but
they won't give you cheese and carrots and celery and other
healthy stuff.  And their coffee?  Ew!  Out of dispenser
boxes and urns, probably brewed a month ago.  You can watch
us brew ours fresh.

For their slow, inferior product, OSCON charges as much as
$2000, while the Linux Clinic is Free As In Beer.  We won't
have beer, I'm afraid, but you can sneak into parties for
free during OSCON week.  Tell them Randal Schwartz sent you.

At random times. Lunch. Time for me to go around and see the booths

The Expo Hall is open to non-exhibitors on Wednesday and Thursday. In
the past occasionally a PLUG person would stop by while touring the
Expo Hall themselves. If they are not in a hurry they might offer to
watch the booth for a bit. Sometimes we have had a person help for a
couple hours at a time. This is good because occasionally it gets busy
and more than one person is handy. Around lunch time is also good
because you know I need time to maintain my calorie-enhanced body.

The output of attempting to install autodie says it needs perl and identify-perl, but both are installed as shown by the subsequent commands...

This sounds similar to a Stack Overflow question where an i386 package was
trying to be installed on an x86_64 bit system:

You're correct in that the perl package itself doesn't appear to require
native compilation of anything.  However, it does look like Ubuntu has
separate packages for each architecture (I don't run Ubuntu so I can't
easily confirm, anyone?):
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/i386/libautodie-perl
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/amd64/libautodie-perl

You might also try the following link which discusses the possibility of
your package database being corrupt or otherwise out of sync:
http://www.mydigitallife.info/ubuntu-unmet-dependencies-not-going-to-be-installed-or-try-apt-get-f-install-error/


As a side note, Paul Fenwick is the listed author, is a frequent visitor to
Portland and has been hanging out since Open Source Bridge last month; not
relevant since this looks like an Ubuntu issue, but it's an interesting
reminder of how much of the Perl community and history is centered around
or interconnected with the community here.

Message-ID: <863A5CF8-754E-4A7E-ABEE-07651C9A9CAF@dimstar.net>

I'm trying to read the content of a file to specify the name of a server to a python script. If I set the variable directly, it works fine If I read the file, the script fails with a 'can't find server' error. 

Setting the hostname directly is easy enough:

SERVER_NAME = fqdn.domain.net

That works fine... Adding a print to the script prints the appropriate hostname.

If, however, I try to read the filename from a file, I get what amounts to a host not found error:

f1 = open('/path/to/file', 'r')

SERVER_NAME = f1.read()
f1.closed

And again, printing the variable prints the correct hostname, but when the script attempts to access the host, it can't find the host. 

Ideas?

To check for this, try: 

print(repr(SERVER_NAME))

That was it. I looked at the file with vi after :set list, and it had a newline. I added:

HOST_NAME = HOST_NAME[:-1] 

and now it works.

You might want to look into Python's configparser for future use.

And when someone edits the file and removes the newline it will break again.
consider HOST_NAME.restrip() to remove any whitespace without touching your needed data.

If this were Perl I'd say use chomp, but it's not.  I found the suggestion on stackoverflow.

Subject: [PLUG] Conferences, Powerpoint, and freedom
Message-ID: <20130726070412.GA18489@gate.kl-ic.com>

I am scheduled to speak at the IEEE Sustainable Technologies 
Conference at the Lloyd Center Doubletree on Thursday morning
August 1, next week.  This morning, the conference chair sent
out an email saying that all presentations must be Powerpoint,
the first time this imperative demand has been made of me.  I
use my own open source tool, wydiwys, because I can navigate
faster and do Q&A faster with the hierachical presentation
menus built into my tool.

I have presented Server Sky at thirty conferences over three
years;  although I've often done so among a sea of Microsoft-
only presenters, I've always got my machine swapped in and
running in a few seconds, sometimes with an assistant so I
could talk through those few seconds.  I could use an assistant
on Thursday morning. 

I've even presented this way at the Microsoft Conference Center
back in the day when Linux did not autofind the projector and
required rebooting.  It was fun showing the Ubuntu splash page,
then a presentation with features Powerpoint can't duplicate.
The microsofties present looked a little green.

The conference chair may prove intransigent, perhaps physically
restraining me from moving a VGA connector, or cancelling my
talk.  I hope not.

But, if this happens, I imagine we could have great fun if I
instead did the presentation across the street in Holladay
Park, with the open source and other radical communities
swelling my audience.  Perhaps inviting the papers and the
TV media, getting some attention for open source and the
M$ monopoly.  

That is way too much work for me to set up, but if there are
people looking for a CAUSE, and willing to organize permits and
handle press relations and print flyers and stuff, I'm willing
to make the presentation that way.  I have a kilowatt portable
generator and a too-small-to-be-useful-outside projector.  To
make this go we will need to borrow a Really Powerful Projector
to work in tree-filtered daylight.

Was it really a demand or just confusion between the generic and brand 
name? (e.g. tissues, soda, slides)

You can export your Impress slides as a ppt.  Perhaps one slide with a 
video of you giving the talk...

I can assist if all that's involved is hardware wrangling, whether in the
conference hall or in the park. I'm no activist, someone else will have to
take up the responsibility for doing it legally and getting the word out.

Although Impress strives to be bug-compatible with Powerpoint,
there are 21 versions of PPT (Win and Mac) to be compatible
with, and the same morass of font problems, inadvertent mode
switching, etc.  The problem isn't whether something is
compatible with PPT, it is whether PPT is compatable with PPT.

After years of never-the-same-twice, often unreadable slides, I
gave up on all that and wrote my own web-based presenter, using
HTML and JQuery and (for now) Flash for the animations, with a
Perl front end compiler.  I use an RF presenter to navigate a
hierarchical collection of slides, which saves much time during
Q/A.  With a few clicks I can get to any slide, including the 10x
more backup slides I've built with answers to common questions. 

http://server-sky.com/wydiwys

The slides are all autoscaling fixed-ratio images, which makes 
the presentations big (especially with the full-frame animations)
but that leaves very little for the browser to misinterpret.

In theory, if the presentation laptop has a browser that can parse
standard lemonade html with CSS, javascript, and flash, I'm golden.
I can and have presented off USB drives, even off the web.  But
browsers on M$ platforms are even more unpredictable than PPT.

The only predictable aspect of M$ is $;  M they certainly aren't.

BTW - I was blowing off steam when I posted the protest in the
park stuff.  I'll negotiate something.  Or I'll just call my
presentation directory "PPT".

I could use some help Thursday morning, someone AV savvy enough
to move cables or reset projectors or the Windows laptop so the
session chair and I can focus on our own tasks.

I think it's great that you're trying to come up with something that
is more flexible and universal than PPT.  Over the last few months
I've dabbled with a number of open source projects that are trying to
do the same thing with HTML5 and S5, etc.  I really like the
flexibility of arranging slides into a two dimensional canvas and then
just telling the system what order I want to see the slides in for a
particular talk.  And scalable graphics/fonts/etc are definitely the
way to go to maintain that flexibility.  I can do without Flash, and
would prefer to.

I have two problems right now with getting complete sold on these
approaches:
 1. Migration.  
    I have a ton of content in ODP and I need to be able to convert
    it.  It doesn't have to be a perfect conversion, but I don't want
    to have to copy/paste everything. 

 2. WYSIWYG
    Yes, I can hand-code HTML and write scripts to generate HTML and
    the like, but I don't want to.  When I sit down to build a slide
    deck, I want to focus on my content, not the mechanics of the
    slide system.  A WYSIWYG doesn't have to be highly featureful.
    Just enough to arrange some text and images in a slide and then
    define which slides to show when.

Recently I've done a couple of presentations in InkScape using one of
the presentation plugins.  This generates a large SVG file that
includes JavaScript to run the slide transitions.  Since InkScape is a
decent WYSIWYG for arbitrarily sized canvases, this gives me most of
#2.  I also found by exporting my ODP slides as PDF (with a specific
set of options), I was able to import my slides into InkScape while
maintaining the scalable aspects of them.

Still, this solution is far from perfect.  The plugin I'm using for
InkScape, Sozi, has a pretty terrible interface being modal and not
allowing one to easily set the order of slides from within the rest of
the UI.  Also, converting from the PDFs has several downsides when it
comes to further editing the slides.  

Can anyone suggest other alternatives that I maybe haven't
investigated?

tim,

   The beamer class in LaTeX (or LyX if you prefer the GUI front end). I've
prepared presentations this way for a dozen or more years. The results are
typeset (TeX), math formulae and equations are properly formatted, graphics
can be added in many different formats (I usually use PSTricks for them, but
also use the R lattice package for plots), and the results are .pdf files
using pdflatex. You can navigate easily, any flavor computer that can
display PDF files will work, and you can control everything about the layout
and appearance because underneath it's all LaTeX.

   One of the big advantages is that the presentations look professional, not
the cluttered, difficult-to-read junk that is characteristic of almost all
PPT presentations.

   I can send an example or two if you want to see the results.

Hi Rich,

Thanks for the suggestion.

I've used LyX before for research papers, and the WYSIWYM approach is
fine by me.  I have used PSTricks.  However, I do remember having a
lot of trouble with LaTeX package dependencies and the like and it was
never clear to me the right way to address those when using LyX.  I
would not be interested in hand-coding LaTeX to do presentations.
Also, I have a feeling that HTML5 is just going to look way snazzier
for dynamic presentations. Take a look at a few examples (in an HTML5
compliant browser):
  http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/
  http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/
  http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/#/bored
  

Of course you can go way overboard with slide transitions, but I do
find true utility in having the ability to zoom in on large diagrams
in the middle of a talk to show more detail.  Having a tree of
slides, rather than a simple linear slide deck, is also really nice.
For instance, the main talk could be 20 slides long, but on a
particular sub-topic of the talk, if someone asks for more info,
branching off onto that tangent of slides to help answer it.  Longer
talks on the same topic could go down some of the branches of the
tree to provide more depth.  No need to copy/paste slides from one
presentation to another for a talk you give in different-length time
slots. Just have one big deck and cherry-pick the slides you want to
use for that specific audience.

Back to your suggestion: do you know of an easy way to go from ODP to
LaTeX/Beamer?

tim,

   No, because I've no experience with anything but LaTeX/beamer for
presentations.

   If I may comment on your statement about HTML5 being 'snazzier': I see
'snazzy' as one of the problems with PPT presentations. The emphasis is on
looks rather than clear presentation of content. All beamer docs (the one
that comes with the class and Herbert Voss's new book) stress simplicity and
clarity on the slides.

   How many PPT presentations have you suffered through where each slide had
a pretty picture as a background with low contrast text over it, almost
solid text on the slide, and the presenter with his back to the audience
reading the slide out loud? With LaTeX/beamer you have a plain background,
your choice of the hierarchy visible, and only a few bullet points (or a
diagram). The visuals are to augment what you say, not have so much that
someone can read all the slides and not need to hear your presentation. I no
longer put the company logo on each slide, only on the title slide.

   Of course, it's all a matter of personal preference. I prefer substance
over form since I'm not a graphic artist or designer.

Rich

There are a number of problems with the common tools that do not need
to be repeated.  The presentation tool should NOT be the design tool(s).
Nor should the presentation tool be able to alter the appearance of a
slide or animation, beyond perhaps fitting the fixed aspect ratio of
the slide into a larger/smaller/wider/taller display area.

For now, I prepare the images and animations with whatever graphics
tool I need, from gimp to gnuplot to inkscape to libreoffice capture
to PNG.   I build Flash animations with png2swf, still the animation
format with the widest browser share.  There are newer HTML5 video
formats, but there are a lot of non-updated browsers that don't
support them.  I built the little bit of JQuery and javascript that
goes with the slides to interpret mouse and keyboard and the clicks
from common RF presenter tools.  All in all, the browser side support
is as damned simple and common as I can make it, and so far, any
browser with Javascript, CSS, and Flash Just Works with wydiwys.

I use the "enter" key (or the black/white button on the presenter)
to toggle between images and a slide list.  If I click (or mouse)
up to the first in the list (for now called MASTER) and click that,
it takes me up one level of hierarchy to another list.  I can keep
adding master directories and build giant trees of slides.  I can
imagine doing a 9 week course arranged by subject and day.  

I can upload the presentations to a website and they Just Work,
download and work as files, etc.  No complicated server side stuff.

The creation "tool" right now is about 1000 lines of Perl, more or
less a very simple compiler.  It reads the text source ( with a few
compiler directives, a half-dozen fixed format "commands", and some
includes that pull in stuff like wydiwys.js from the source directory).

I manually erase the target directory, run "wydiyws < [design source file],
and cycle until the errors stop (typically a missing or misnamed png
file).  The program builds a series of hierarchially interlinked HTML
stubs, which present a slide, an animation, or an image menu as needs
be.  For now the compiler only works with *nix, and hardlinks files
from the target directory to the image source directory.  That probably
should have a command line flag (hardlink or copy), but I have a few
dozen presentations linked to the same source images, and I like to
be able to fix a slide used in many images by fixing the source image.

I could in theory pipe the output of a GUI tool into the compiler tool.
Or use an entirely different compiler format.  Or drive the system
with an Eclipse module.  The point is that the resulting presentations
are self contained.  I do add a subdirectory to the presentation 
directory which contains the design files and the wydiwys compiler;
I can rebuild a modified presentation with just that directory, a
text editor, and a bare-minimum version of Perl.

With flash animations and backup slides, my presentations can run as
large as 200MB.  Horrors, 20 cents worth of USB drive. 

If Impress or Powerpoint can be scripted internally or externally,
perhaps they can be trained to dump out images one at a time into
a source directory, and create a linear wydiyws source.  But that
would lose the human-readable hierarchy.

----

This is all a kludge;  but it does allow me to build a new presentation
from an old one in five minutes, fix images and have them propagate,
and use any tools I want to make any PNG/JPG/??? graphic that a browser
can display.  I can't go in and change all the fonts on all the slides,
but that would be a bug, not a feature.  I standardize my slide designs
with Tiresias Displayfont, because it is damned easy to read, but an
image is just and image and the browsers don't care.

If you want to autocreate slides from a source file and templates,
build a tool for that, but please leave the browser and CSS out of it.

Features I wish I had time to add:
  1) selectable, voiceover, slide advance, subtitles.  JQuery has
     modules for those.   
  2) Second screen with a script for the stage-frightened.  That would
     get a little bit server-sidey.  Extra bonus points if the "second
     screen" was a smart phone or other handheld, not merely splitting
     laptop screen and the VGA output screen.
  3) Better error message system.  Right now the wydiwys compiler finds
     one error and quits.
  4) A pre-splash page that detects browser capabilities, and loads a
     somewhere-out-on-the-web page with install links for missing bits.

I NEVER want to lose the simple text input format, and the stand-alone
web standard fileglob.  Unix.  Simple little tools, piped together. 
So sayeth Saint Ritchie, so sayeth POSIX, so sayeth my LART stick.

Yeah, so if that's not possible/easy, then that'll prevent me from

I'm the same way.  And because you're saying that, I suspect you're
missing the point of what I'm saying.

Often one wants to include screenshots or complex diagrams in a
presentation to illustrate a dataflow or program output.  But there's
rarely enough space to do this in one slide and still have it readable
to the audience.  You could create 5 diagrams or screenshots with
sliced up subsets of the information, each in a different slide, but
that's not flexible and it takes time to cut them all up in just the
right way.

A zoomable canvas gets around this issue.  This is a standard feature
of the Prezi-knockoffs.  Just throw your graphic (preferrably
scalable) in there, and then if you need to focus on particular
elements, either define a slide box that zooms in on it automatically,
or during the talk you can do this manually.  Defining slide boxes by
hand by entering some numbers into source code is far from efficient.
It takes you out of the mindset of building content.

Message-ID: <20130727002158.GG20809@gate.kl-ic.com>

I wrote a long email about wydiwys (What You Draw Is What You See,
http://server-sky.com/wydiwys) but I should add a bit about my
presentation philosophy:

   Slides have pictures
   My mouth makes the words
   Reading slides is EVIL

OK, I do have words on slides;  labels and diagrams and such.  I
have been known to put lists on slides but I should be punished
for that.  Bullet points deserve hollowpoints to the brain. 
When I do put words on slides, I aim for 100 point, never
smaller than 40 unless I am making a point about unreadability.
400 point is hard on audience members with weak bladders.

Guy Kawasaki's rule - divide the age of the oldest person in the
audience by 2, and never use a font smaller than that.  If your
business presentation has an old wrinkly guy in the room, he's
the rich investor who approves the million dollar checks. 
Don't piss him off.

Keith's rule - Paul Fenwick is a Presentation God.  So is
Lawrence Lessig.  So are Larry Wall and Damien Conway. 
Thou Shalt Slavishly Copy every trick they use.  Until
you develop better tricks.  Which you won't, fool.

I don't run code in my presentations, mine usually are about
hardware.  There are web ssh clients, and bringing up an ssh
text window to a server side bash process, with the command
you want to type in ALREADY TYPED IN, is the way I would do
that.  But I would seriously consider capturing the output
that I want as an animation instead, so that a canned web
demo does not require human input, or a working connection to
anything live, and the web demo doesn't open security holes.  

But I don't run code, so my opinion doesn't count for much.

I'm all for the separation of design and content, but unfortunately
the real world is more complex than that.  

I'd be fine with entering my text into a bunch of files and then
defining my slide trees in another file, and having that all auto
generated onto a full canvas.  But then I'd need to be able to throw
in diagrams, images and the like in the appropriate place, and I find
it a waste of time to have to type numbers into a file to place
objects on the screen.  Then after that, having the ability to just
draw a frame on top of an object, to create a zoom-in slide is also
something that needs some kind of GUI.

Yeah, but don't we all want Flash to die?  I mean really, no one likes
it.  It is proprietary and it has a horrible history of
vulnerabilities.  Even Adobe knows they need to retire it.  HTML5 is
the replacement.  It works in phones, it is a standard, it'll be
faster, and if the new features create vulnerabilities in one browser,
just use another.

I'm sure it can't be that hard to export textual content from Impress,
given the internal XML representation.  They even separate layout from
content in most ODT formats.  But I don't want to reinvent the wheel
and I'm still not sold on any particular system to convert to, so I'm
not going to bother scripting it just yet.

That would be handy.

Remember, Mark Shuttleworth has closed bug #1 -- and after hearing
presentations on things like AsciiDoc, (which can generate multiple
formats, including HTML, PDF, ePub, etc.) I'm convinced that the
PowerPoints of the world will disappear before we retire.

   I don't have this issue since I'm not presenting on coding or other

I have downloaded a number of pdf files from a website.  In Document Viewer

 Opening them in Chrome they look fine, as does printing.

Denis,

   Not yours, but the Microsoft version used by the creator. I have PDFs that
do not display (or print) correctly in xpdf, but do just fine in epdfview
and acroread. When you find a pdf view that works for you, just use it.

PDF version 1.2 is kind of old. But that shouldn't matter for viewing
it. An older version is a problem only if creating a PDF and trying to
use features not available in the old version.

I use Evince as my default viewer, and I can't remember ever having a
problem viewing a PDF file. There are other Linux PDF viewers, notably
Okular and GSView. And there is always Adobe Reader for Linux. I also
have installed the proprietary viewers Cabaret and Foxit, as well as
a number of PDF editors.

And the chair, seeing my plight, has worked with me to relax the
constraints.  I must make sure that I don't screw up the tight
transition to the next powerpoint presentation, but the session
chair and I are working out alternatives.  

I may be able to run my webslides from the conference laptop,
assuming that version of Firefox (or Internet Explorer) is
configured to run javascript, flash animations, and local files. 

A better alternative is me bringing my own projector, putting
it on a platform above the conference projector, and show slides
using my own laptop and cabling, while shuttering the light output
from the conference projector with a black box surrounding the
lens.  I will bring a libreoffice generated PPT, one slide,
full screen black, for the conference projector.  

Hopefully, this will allow the next presenter to set up their
slides and start presenting the moment I finish with Q/A . 

I am still looking for help with the setup, just in case something
glitches the windoze machine or projector.  I'm trying to contact
the AV contractor for the conference, perhaps I can pay one of
their people to hang around and fix unexpected problems.

We still need to smash the Powerpoint monopoly, and replace bullet
point list slides with more humane and effective presentations.
But that is a long term problem to solve separately from the
environmental problems we will address at the conference this week.

I apologise to the conference and the chair for making protest
threats and to this list for my rant.

As I said, viewing is not a problem.  Printing from Document Viewer (3.4.0)
is, with these apparently older versions.

Agreed.  We just switched to Frontier Fios here near Seattle.  They're not
perfect, but they are a lot smaller than comcast.

I've enjoyed opusnet.com;
they are Linux-frindly (or at least "platform transparent")
and they have a physical office in Portland, so if anything extreme happens, a face-time meeting with real people, or an in-person demo of hardware gone wrong is at least a possibility.
And their rates are modest.

Subject: [PLUG] Yum is immortal
Message-ID: <20130730213256.7ed30246@Devil8>

This evening I was trying to install a program from source. Yeah, I
should know better. But I have what appear to be superb detailed
instructions. Except that the instructions are for Ubuntu so they are
full of apt-get commands, but generally all I have to do is replace
apt-get with yum.

There was a command:

sudo yum install qt4-dev-tools libqt4-opengl-dev libqtwebkit-dev

It executed without error, but after 15 minutes I assumed it was hung,
so I killed it with Ctrl-Z. Then I tried it again, but just the
qt4-dev-tools. This gave me:

Existing lock /var/run/yum.pid: another copy is running as pid 20774.
Another app is currently holding the yum lock; waiting for it to exit...
  The other application is: yum

So I tried 'sudo kill 20774' and the command executed without error,
but yum is still running. I tried killing 20774 from sudo top, and
again it executed without error, and still failed to kill yum.

I can't do anything until I figure out how to drive a stake through
yum's heart. Any suggestions?

sudo kill -9 20774

The dash 9 causes a "sure kill".

Next time kill interactive processes with control c.  Control z suspends
the process, and returns control to the command line.

Hope this helps -- Patrick Timlick

ctrl-z doesn't kill things. ctrl-c does.

the normal kill command by default, just asks the process to terminate
nicely. to kill something harder than the default, use kill -9. this tells
the process, "ok, you're done now." this may still leave you with issues
relating to the lock file, as yum won't have a chance to delete it before
ending. it'll depend on how yum handles an orphaned lock file.

If you're using yum, I assume *cough*cough* that you're using a
Red Hat/Fedora based system of some sort.  In that case, the
development packages are labeled *-devel, not *-dev.  The latter
is Debian/Ubuntu.

<Ctrl-Z> _suspends_ a program, it doesn't kill it.  You can do
things like run the ever-popular program "foo", then suspend it
with <ctrl-z>.  After that, you can put it in the background with
"bg %1" or back into the foreground with "fg %1".  (The job number
[%1, here] is reported when you suspend the job.)

The kill command wants a signal with which to chastise the errant
program.  -TERM should abort most programs.  If not, the old
standby of -KILL should do it.  E.g., "kill -KILL 20774".  You
only need the sudo if the program isn't being run by you.

$ ps aux | grep -i yum
(returned info)
$ kill -TERM <yum_process_number>

That ought to do it.

Thanks for the tip. Yes, the instructions are for Ubuntu, but I'm using
Fedora. Most of the time I can just substitute 'yum' for 'apt-get,' but
apparently not willy-nilly.

I went back and noted that my suspend command reported number 3, so I
tried 'fg %3,' and that brought it out of the background. Then I did a
proper Ctrl-c, but yum is still running.

I tried kill -9 and got nowhere, but the 'ps aux | grep -i yum' command
produced a fair list of processes. I killed them all, but 20774 was
still running. Finally I used 'sudo kill -KILL 20774.' It executed
without error and Yum is finally gone. Apparently -KILL is stronger
than -9, or at least here it was.

And having succeeded in killing yum, I now discover that package
database is apparently corrupted:

I'm not sure what all this means. With apt-get you could do 'apt-get
update' and it would go out to the repositories and fix everything up.
I tried man yum, but I couldn't find an equivalent. 

Yum and broken databases will have to wait for tomorrow. Time for bed.
Thanks to all who offered suggestions.

Actually, this is more of a case of the FCC being wishy-washy with
their regulations. To date, "network neutrality" has not been truly
defined:
http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-10-201A1.pdf

So lets not fly off the handle.

Under the laws of the USA, any service provider (internet or
otherwise) can restrict the uses of their "product"  based on the
needs of their business.  Yes, even, and especially, a small ISP, not
just Google, needs to worry about some users hogging bandwidth so that
other customers have trouble using the service.  Even a restaurant can
restrict the definition or "all you can eat."

A less sensationalistic report is here:
http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/07/google-we-can-ban-servers-on-fiber-without-violating-net-neutrality/

That said, It's still a bum deal - if you want to run a server.  99%
don't. And, this is what Comcast, Verizon, ATT, and any number of big
or small ISPs gave done for years.

So, before we assume Google is Evil, perhaps consider the sad state of
true broadband in the USA.  With Google's push into true 21st Century
data speeds, they may just be forcing the FCC and Congress to get off
their collective arses.  Nothing gets things moving faster than irate
taxpayers!

For future reference, from the kill man page:
       Name     Num   Action    Description
       ...
       KILL       9   exit      cannot be blocked

-KILL and -9 are the same. 
sudo made the difference.

On rare occasion, a kill -9 doesn't work. You should be able to delete
the /var/run/yum.pid file.

Ctrl-Z does not kill a process, it "stops" it.  The process is still
active, all it's files and sockets are still open, it still holds any
locks it has taken.  A process that has been stopped can be resumed in
foreground or in background.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1307311110010.20035@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Some folks here are much more familiar with LibreOffice than am I and can
probably help be understand and correct an annoying font issue.

   My clients all use M$ Office so I get data from them in Excel
spreadsheets. I save these spreadsheets in .ods format and re-organize the
data so it can be exported prior to loading in a database table. When I move
(cut-and-paste) cells from one sheet to another, or one cell to another on
the same sheet, the set font changes.

   The default font I use is Bitstream Amerigo 10pt and I set that for each
sheet in the workbook by selecting all cells in each sheet and specifying
that typeface and size. But, when I move cell content the now empty cell has
the typeface of Calibri (which I don't have on my system) and a size of 11
points. Where does this originate? If I specify the desired typeface and
size for all cells (with or without content), how can a different font be
assigned to cells as soon as I delete their content?

Puzzled,

Rich

The issue is that kill -9 kills the process with extreme prejudice, in
this case that means immediately.  The process does not have time to
clean up.  Always try just "kill" first, this sends a TERM signal which
can be caught and a sophisticated program(such as most programs that use
locks) can clean up and then exit.  Some times thee processes wander off
into the weeds and you have to use -9 to kill them, unfortunately they
then often leave trash (such as lock files) in the file system.

I rarely use Calc and I'm too lazy to verify this, but in the
Preferences there are some default settings, including default fonts.

John,

   That is correct and the default font is set to Bitstream Amerigo, 10pt.
That's why I'm wondering where the other one comes from.

I'm gonna guess the XLS comes with its own stylesheets and default style.
If you're collaborating with MS users, I would strongly recommend
installing MS fonts. I know Fedora, Slack and Ubuntu have packages to do
this - usually called fonts-non-free, webcore or whatever.

Aaron,

   The only collaboration is they send me raw data and I send them analytical
results and interpretations. Once I save the .xls as .ods I delete the
former.

   Accepting that the .xls sheets have their own styles and fonts, shouldn't
they be changed to my default styles and fonts when I save them in LO
format? Or, is there a way I can change them to what I use somewhere in the
styles setting (in which I pick 'default' thinking it's what I defined)?

Thanks,

Rich

have you considered saving them as CSV? perhaps as an intermediary step
between XLS and ODS?

wes,

   No, I haven't. When I get the data re-organized in a single spreadsheet I
export it as CSV for import into the database table and analytical software.
You do raise a good point and I'll try that.

Thanks,

Rich

Next time you open an .xls file (in LO) look at the styles settings
before doing anything else. MS Office uses a style they call "normal"
or something like that. By default all documents have at least the
normal style. Even if the people who created the files did not apply
any styles their data still has the normal style applied. Perhaps your
funny font is lurking in there.

   Good point, John.

   I changed the style from 'normal2' to 'default' but the darn font still
pops up when I empty the contents of a cell.

I think John's on the right track, here.  When you load one of
these xls spreadsheets into Calc, check the styles.  Find the one
that the sheet is using and change the font to whatever you want
it to be.

Hope this helps.

Dale,

   Makes sense to me, too. I knew you folks could help me understand how LO
works with imported files.

Try using paste special, where you do not paste the format.  (uncheck all,
then uncheck format.)

I can't remember if LO allows you to import styles from other
documents. If so, set yourself a template document with your own style.
Use a distinct name so you can be sure it's yours when you find it
applied. The next time you open an .xls file select everything and
apply your style to it before you do anything else. Assuming all that
went according to plan, it will be interesting to see what happens when
you empty the contents of a cell.
