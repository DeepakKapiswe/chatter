Thanks for the idea. When I get back, I'll give that a try. While I've 
known about cron, I have yet to actually do anything with it. This looks 
like a good opportunity to learn about it.

Subject: [PLUG] DNS behind cisco 67x adsl router
Message-ID: <20040901101026.2385bf0f@slate.copperisle.com>

I was recently astonished to find the NAT on our Cisco 678
adsl router was messing with responses from our DNS server!

It was mostly accidental that I even discovered the problem.  For
months I had run a similar setup without any suspicion.

Anyway, if any of you are running your own public DNS servers
behind the Cisco 67x router, test it from an external host.  You
are sure to be similarly affected.  Here are some notes for a
workaround:

  http://www.guinix.com/technote/pdxdsl-01.html

By the way, this isn't an issue of the DNS server; bind and
tinydns will be similarly affected.  The problem is in the Cisco.

I have since set up the Cisco as a transparent bridge, and now do
the Qwest linkup using PPPoE to cut the Cisco NAT out entirely:

  http://www.guinix.com/technote/pdxdsl-02.html

More recently I put up m0n0wall on a Soekris box for this
purpose, which makes PPPoE _very_ easy.  Notes on that are in the
works...

The surprise for some here may be that you can do PPPoE at
all with your Qwest service--at least it was a surprise for me. 
But it turns out this is very easy, gets your public IP on your
own host, and allows you to run a much wider variety of adsl CPE
than we have been led to believe is possible.

Stay well!

Wayne

I have a couple of Belkins that are connected together that work fine 
most of the time.  Every once in a while though they go crazy and the 
only way to fix them is to disconnect everything and then reconnect 
everything.  If I had to purchase again I would most likely go with 
another brand.

My experience with desktop KVMs is limited to the Belkin Omni View Pro 
(mine's the 4-Port model). I use one constantly at work; my main 
desktop runs 1400x1050/24 bits/85Hz. It seems to perform as 
advertised.

As I said, however, I don't really have any point of comparison; this 
is the only model I've ever used.

I use Cybex at work and at home.  They work great in my experience.

There's another brand that I have at home that I won't recommend - 
when the computer you're attached to freezes you can't switch to 
another one.  I'll pass along the brand name when I can.

Paul,

  So, for the Belkin brand it's tied at 1-1. Don't know if models make a
difference; they do on some hardware.

I've used most of those models listed below with similar results.
The only input I can add is that some may be better suited to your usage
than others.
We use Avocent boxes here only because we have multiple racks of servers
and desktops that need integrated into multiple viewing and management
spots. These use RJ45 Cat5 cabling and are active at boot time. They
have management and security features built into them with password
protection. For a long time before we went to this scale of use we used
the cybex. Before that it was the Black Box and Rose KVM's. 

Only technical issue to look out for is to stay away from Mechanical
switches in your kvm. The switches will wear out much faster than
digital or simple push button switches. We dumped many of our early
kvm's because of that.

I have used the Belkin Omniview 4 port with no issues. I currently use a Linksys 2 port with no problems.

Marv,

  I do believe that the shell's built-in commands take precedence. If you
want to use the separate executable, specify the full path.

I bought a Linksys KVM 2K11 from the folks at Pacific Solutions on 
Powell, just east of Foster. It's worked well for me. They have 
mechanical ones and electronic ones. They recommended against the 
mechanical ones if you have a large monitor. I was using a 19" Hitachi 
up until a couple of months ago, so went with the electronic. I'm happy 
I did: two clicks of the scroll lock key is all it takes to switch from 
my Linux box to my Win98 box. No problems in the several months I've had it.

In tcsh, you can say:


which command

and it will tell you what it is using.

If you say:

where command

then it will list all possible commands as determined by the search path.

  Since getting the system to boot into the 2.4.27 kernel yesterday
(actually, it's been since last week) I cannot print anything. I'm running
CUPS on this RH 7.3 box. Here's what I've done:

  Cleaned up /etc/cups/printers.conf (so they're all idling and waiting for
jobs).

  Killed a stuck parallel port process.

  Stopped and restarted /etc/rc.d/init.d/cups.

  Checked that the cable was properly seated on the port.

  Jobs don't make it out of the server to the printer. When I invoke
/usr/sbin/printers I can see the jobs, but they never complete. Same with a
test sent from there.

  I've had cups hang before, but it's always been a stuck parallel port
process and/or printers.conf showing the printer as not available. I've run
through all my experiences and tried all the things I could imagine, but
still no luck. I'd greatly apprecate some external suggestions.

Thanks,

Rich

Does the printer show up at http://localhost:631 ?

I use a Linksys 4 port with out problems and have used it with Redhat,
Suse, and win 95- win xp without issue except one.
I had to go with a different kind of wheel mouse than I had
originally. but it turned out to be a driver on the OS and not the
KVM.

For Home and SOHO, I like the Linksys equipment.

Bash has which and whereis  but, that only lists
names for commands in directories.  NOT builtin

This dosen't seem to answer the question.

Thanks for the feedback.

If you try:
type echo

it will tell you if the command is builtin or run from a file.

Mel,

  Sure does. That BUI is equivalent to running /usr/sbin/printers from the
command line.

  What's strange -- and may have something to do with the problem although I
forgot to mention it in my original post -- is that no parallel ports show
up in the list of devices. Not on the Web page and not on the dialog box.
Only serial and USB.

  Perhaps CUPS forgot that there are parallel ports and that's why it cannot
send the data out. The printer definitions specify parallel ports but the
admin tools don't see them.

  Is there a way to restart parallel ports within the OS?

Thanks,

Rich

I think Rich has it right.

  If you type "echo --help" you get the built-in echoing the string
"--help".  If you type "/bin/echo --help" you get the gnu help information.

Subject: [PLUG] Free Software building options for network C++ application to Win32
Message-ID: <86isaxa636.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I am looking for options for compiling the C++ slave component of my
master/slave system so that I can get random win32-using losers to
help me out (with informed consent, of course).

I know about Cygwin and DJGPP, but the former (I think) needs a bunch
of infrastructure installed, and DJGPP (I think) seems to lack POSIX-y
networking interfaces.  I was kind of hoping to have a simple EXE
someone (like my unconverted relatives) could download and run.  

Any suggestions?

  More information: I just ran lsmod and see (among other modules):

lp                      7776   0  (autoclean)
parport                33376   0  (autoclean) [lp]

  So, ... why might CUPS be blind to parallel ports on this box?

Thanks,

Rich

While we're on the subject, has anyone used 'Linkskey' (not Linksys!)?
I'm looking at getting one of these 16-port rack mount models, and the
price is almost too good to be true:

Steve's approach is quite good, I think.  Here's the output of some
commands that might interest y'all:

jbrelin at shaft:~$ type -a echo
echo is a shell builtin
echo is /bin/echo
jbrelin at shaft:~$ echo --help
--help
jbrelin at shaft:~$ /bin/echo --help
Usage: /bin/echo [OPTION]... [STRING]...
Echo the STRING(s) to standard output.

  -n              do not output the trailing newline
  -e              enable interpretation of the backslash-escaped
characters
                    listed below
      --help      display this help and exit (should be alone)
      --version   output version information and exit (should be alone)

With -e, the following sequences are recognized and interpolated:

  \NNN   the character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal)
  \\     backslash
  \a     alert (BEL)
  \b     backspace
  \c     suppress trailing newline
  \f     form feed
  \n     new line
  \r     carriage return
  \t     horizontal tab
  \v     vertical tab

Have you looked at the MinGW stuff?

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

One of the OGI researchers wanted it setup as a cross compiler so he 
could develop Win32 applications on Linux. I've got some rpms built, 
though I admit that they (the packages, not necessarily the binary 
files contained in them) still feel a bit ducttape-y.

I'm able to produce simple .exe binaries ("hello, world" and a numeric 
muliplication loop), but time constraints have prevented me from 
trying to compile something even mildly complicated. The researcher 
for whom I built this stuff seems happy, but I haven't really pressed 
him that hard (for fear I'll have more work to do :-).

Holler if you want more info.

  Even more information:

  Running /usr/sbin/lpinfo -v shows no parallel ports present. Also, a
google search shows quite a few folks having this same problem on linux and
freeBSD -- but no solutions!

PITA!

  I wonder if I messed up configuring the 2.4.27 kernel. Here's what is in
/usr/src/linux/.config:

#
# Parallel port support
#
CONFIG_PARPORT=m
# CONFIG_PARPORT_PC is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_AMIGA is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_MFC3 is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_ATARI is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_GSC is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_SUNBPP is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_IP22 is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_OTHER is not set
CONFIG_PARPORT_1284=y

and here's the Character Devices section:

# Character devices
#
CONFIG_VT=y
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_SERIAL=y
# CONFIG_SERIAL_CONSOLE is not set
# CONFIG_SERIAL_EXTENDED is not set
# CONFIG_SERIAL_NONSTANDARD is not set
CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS=y
CONFIG_UNIX98_PTY_COUNT=256
CONFIG_PRINTER=m
# CONFIG_LP_CONSOLE is not set
# CONFIG_PPDEV is not set
# CONFIG_TIPAR is not set

  Was I supposed to build these in the kernel rather than as loadable
modules?

I have a Belkin 8-port Omniview and the one really annoying thing (I
believe this is the same across the entire line, as of my vintage) is
that it uses double tap Scroll Lock as an attention key to the
KVM. But Scroll Lock is used in the Linux console, and the KVM doesn't
always catch both...

  Yup. I did.

  Checked the 2.4.19 kernel and I have both CONFIG_PARPORT_PC=m and
CONFIG_PARPORT_OTHER=m.

  Haven't checked for differences in the char devices section yet. But, I
rebooted into 2.4.19 et voila! Printing.

  Guess it's time to rebuild 2.4.27.

As I am also interested in this, could you expand on what Scroll Lock
is used for in a Linux console?  I just tried it on a Mandrake 9.1
machine and couldn't see any effect.  Is it anything I might want to
use? [How's that for an open-ended question? :-)]

"In linux command line sessions, the Scroll Lock key is
used to pause screen output. This behavior emulates the Hold Screen key or
similar flow control mechanisms on computer terminals. Because of this
emulation, the term scroll lock is sometimes used to generically refer to a
screen pausing behavior."

  I guess if you're quick on the draw you can use the scroll lock key
instead of ctrl-s/ctrl-q or a pager (more, less, least).

It does what it says it does.

Play around with "ls -lR /" and the Scroll Lock key.

Well, come to find out, with a minimum of commenting out stuff (argp
not available, but they don't need no steenking options!), and a minor
tweek (gethostbyname2 wasn't available, but plain old gethostbyname
was), it compiles under cygwin's g++. Combine it with the cygwin1.dll
(just dumped in the same directory), and it runs.  The binaries pack
into a 600k tarball too.  It runs about 1/3 slower under cygwin, but I
guess this'll do the trick.  

And of course, I can't distribute this willy nilly, since at least the
cygwin1.dll is GPL and my tarball doesn't include source, but for my
intended purposes I think it's fine.

Thanks for your suggestion!

It does doesn't it.  And the cables don't look too expensive either.  Sure 
is tempting.  It would be good to get a copy of the manual before 
purchase.  One complaint I have with low-end kvm's are the keys used to 
soft-switch to another port.

  Thanks, all of you, for the feedback. As soon as I get the hardware sorted
out and reorganized here in the office I'll get a switch. That should make
life much less cluttered.

I don't tend to worry about the keys for soft-switching; I've found they
mess up often enough that I just use the hard-switch.  Since this is for
a rack in a server room, it's not going to be used all that much.
Something that's interesting about it is that switching to a particular
port is done directly with a button for each port.  The Belkins I've
used in the past make you cycle through, which can be tedious with 16
ports.  (The OSD with soft-switch helps, sorta.)

And yes, I think the cables are your basic M/M KVM cables, nothing
fancy.

Linkskey certainly has a cheap-looking website; it looks like a Yahoo!
shopping cart: http://www.linkskey.com/kvm/lkv-1680.htm.  Heh, they seem
to have cut & paste the description from their 2-port KVM:

Use one keyboard, one monitor, one mouse to control TWO Computers

(The 8-port has the same thing!)

How do you tell which tty the usb driver attaches to the USB device?

If it's the only one, then it's ttyUSB0.  You can also use udev and have
it automatically create the right right node.  I don't know what you'd
do if you were connecting half a dozen of them though.

Is it weird that it would show up in dmesg and not /var/log/messages?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0409021342190.2708@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Apparently the power supply failure on my venerable, old system torqued
the second drive (with /usr and /usr1; /usr/local is on /dev/hda) such that
the 'needs_recovery' flag is reset even when cleared manually. As this is my
oldest hard drive (a WD 8.4G drive) I don't mind replacing it. I picked up a
WD 120G/7200 rpm/8M cache drive at Best Buy ($120 with $60 in rebates).
Because this coming weekend is Labor Day weekend I'll be laboring away as
usual and this would be a good time to replace the drive. I hope!

  Below is the protocol I believe will allow me to move all of /usr and
/usr1 from /dev/hdb to the new drive, then have the new one recognized as
/dev/hdb. Call it a reality check or a sanity check, but I want to feel
comfortable that I'm doing the proper things in the correct order before I
find myself completely down on a holiday weekend.

  Suggestions, corrections or whatever are welcomed.

Thanks,

Rich

==========================================================================
1.  Disconnect cdrom drive (/dev/hdc).
2.  Connect new (120G) hard drive on that cable.
3.  Power on system; BIOS should detect new drive as /dev/hdc.
4.  Run 'cfdisk' and create two partitions: /dev/hdc1 as /usr and /dev/hdc2 as
/usr1.
5.  Run 'mkfs -cvt ext3' on each partition.
6.  Take a _long_ break.
7.  Mount each partition on /dev/hda1; e.g., /mnt/usr and /mnt/usr1
8.  Use cp/tar/rsync to copy all of /usr to /mnt/usr and all of /usr1 to
/mnt/usr1.
9.  When finished, power down system. Replace existing /dev/hdb with new drive;
replace cable on cdrom drive.
10. Power on system and expect that the new copies of /usr and /usr1 will be
seen properly and mounted correctly within the filesystem.

Do you think it's necessary to use -c on a new drive?

Ed,

  Probably not. But, I just discovered that option and thought it wouldn't
hurt anything. Does it slow things down a lot? Is it unnecessary because the
manufacturer already locked out bad bits?

Well, d'oh!  It does what it was designed to do.  :-)  I somehow read
your comment as implying that Linux used it for something

The manufacturer has built spare disk sectors into the drive. As sectors 
fail,
they're automatically detected by the drive and replaced by spare sectors.
Once the pool of spare sectors is exhausted, the drive is no longer able to
do this and bad sectors become visible to the outside world.

With a new drive, presumably  the pool is far from being exhausted.

That's always a good idea but it costs quite a bit of time.
I just did it a few days ago on a 160 GB drive and it took
a few hours. The drive was quite hot by the time it was
through. I wondered how much "drive life" was spent in
performing the test.

Ed,

  So, with your comprehensive answer and recent experience with a drive
1/3rd again as large as mine, I will remove the 'c' option from the list.

  Other than that, is the protocol correct, optimal and worth following as
is?

- -c *really* slows things down a lot.  It makes formatting a MS
filesystem seem positively swift by comparison.

Rod,

  Danke! I assumed it was OK. But, considering my track record over the past
few weeks I'd rather check in advance.

Quick note, your drive swap protocol came AFTER your signature file and
the signature separater (--\n), so a proper mail reader wouldn't quote the
whole message when replying -- it cuts off at the signature.

I really don't mean this to be any kind of flamewar instigator, but is
there really a reason to use ext3 anymore?  I have one old system with an
ext3 filesystem and it still has to fsck pretty regularly (it gets powered
down alot and the system forces a fsck every so many mounts) and we've
seen plenty of issues on this very list with folks running out of inodes
and stuff like that.

So why bother with the old system?

I've used reiserfs on everything for a couple of years now and have never
lost a filesystem without also losing the entire disk due to hardware
failure.

Genuinely curious,
J.

  First, that's the fs I've used on this box since it became available (with
the 2.2.x kernel series?) and have had absolutely no problems. All the new
boxes run reiserfs, except for the new laptop.

  When I asked Emperor Linux why they insisted on ext3 rather than reiserfs
they told me that in their experience the former was more stable, more solid
and worked better.

  Personally, I doubt that it matters much. As it turns out with the
'needs_recovery' flags set on /dev/hda1 and /dev/hdb1, it was fortunate that
the filesystem is ext3. The rescue disks have utilities for ext2/3 but not
for reiserfs. As a matter of fact, Knoppix wouldn't boot on this box with
the problems on both drives; it hung trying to interpret /etc/fstab. Tom's
root boot disk to the rescue! And it has ext3 tools; perhaps reiserfs, but
we didn't look for any.

  We each use systems differently and have different expectations of
reliability. I've had no problems with either ext3 or reiserfs so I'm a
filesystem agnostic.

  tune2fs is quite the utility! Try it with the '-l' option to list

The fscking is tunable.  You can turn it off or reduce frequency if
you want.  Right?

Jeme> So why bother with the old system?

Not being an expert, they do have different performance
characteristics.  So in some circumstances, ext3 might be better match
to the circumstances.  Also, Hans Reiser is a bit of a flake which
might make some slightly nervous.  A little diversity might have
better survival characteristics than a filesystem monoculture.

Somewhat weird, but certainly not impossible. If you logged

Nothing special, but since it sometimes "leaks" through to Linux you
can be left with machines that might appear to have "locked up" if you
don't remember that little fault of the Belkins.

  I'm trying to learn if legislative hearings are streamed over the 'Net in
real time. If so, what do I need on a system in order to watch it? I have
RealPlayer8 (or 10, I forget which) installed. Is this all I need?

  On the same thread, can ogg vorbis coexist with RealPlayer?

A google search for "legislative hearings streaming video" gave this link:

http://epw.senate.gov/epwmultimedia/epwmultimedia.htm

Seems relevant?

On the main kvm page http://www.linkskey.com/kvm/kvm.htm  there's another 
version LKV-0168OSD which appears to have soft-key switching and the 
ability to chain units together.  The LKV-1680 looks to be a very simple 
unit, manual switching etc...

If you do acquire the kvm, I'd be very interested in your evaluation of 
it.

I have a OmniCube at work with is just fine - except for the scroll lock
issue (which causes problems with Lotus Notes).

The Belkin I had at home was a total PITA. About the third time that piece
of garbage spontaneously went into control-lock mode(!), I pitched it out
a window. As I remember, Will Cooley had seen similar issues.

The key difference seems to be that that one gets it's power off of the
keyboard line. If you decide to buy a Belkin, be sure it has it's own
power supply.

I have an AirLink+ four port from fryes that has never given a problem. 
  Even with a Plan9 box on it and it generally makes kvms go bonkers.

This one gets its power from the keyboard connection too I think.

Dan,

  Thanks. I guess the LinkSys that Dick bought locally would be a good
choice, then.

Unless the state has stopped listening to Karen Minnis (R, wood

anti-open-source stupidity), then RealPlayer is all you need.

RealPlayer cannot play Ogg Vorbis, no.  XMMS, however, can.

Ditto -- the Belkins will freak out, and since they get power from
keyboard/mouse PS/2 connections (rather than just using the DC
current from the wall-wart adapter), the only way to get a complete

What a PITA!!!

I'm pretty happy with the Apex units that IBM resells.

I don't recall if it's been mentioned yet, but mplayer can make use of
the shared libraries that the RealAdvertiser client installs. I find
mplayer signicantly less unpleasant to use than RealPlayer, making this
a really nifty feature.

I should mention though ... the above observations are for a set of
server racks with about 20 connected systems. 

 I do have a small Belkin 4-port at home, and can't really complain
about it with regards to price/performance.  The big difference is that
at home, there are two main systems (the near-ancient Windows box
for Quicken -- it doesn't even get a network connection) and my
general use box.  Sometimes, a 3rd or 4th box will get attached when
helping out friends with "computer problems" (can you say over 200
virus-infected files, plus spyware, plus ad-ware .... yuk!!!!)

So, bottom line:
   Belkin -- bad for real work/production, but fine for the
   home/hobbyist user.

  I just bought a Linksys KVM100SK Proconnect 2 Port KVM Switch w/ cables on
eBay. It's an older model but with good reviews on google. With the two Jet
Direct cards I also just bought on eBay the network here will be undergoing
much simplification and a major upgrade in processing power and speed.

  Thanks to everyone for the experiences and advice.

  You're in her district, too? I must say that she has her good points, too.
Unfortunately, in my opinion at least, all politicians do some things with
which I agree and some things with which I do not at all agree. There will
never be one with whom I'm in complete agreement.

  As I understand the situation explained to me by a colleague, hearings may
or may not be streamed. We're putting in our request and we'll see what
happens.

> RealPlayer cannot play Ogg Vorbis, no.  XMMS, however, can.

  Actually, I thought that to be the case. But, I didn't know what I could
use. Thanks for the pointer.

Message-ID: <1094257014.16536.27.camel@timmy>

This question has (AFAICT) nothing to do with GNU/Linux, but one of you
probably knows the answer.

I have two devices that act like switches. One is an Actiontec 1520
router/gateway/whatever and the other is a WRT54G. The Actiontec drops
over 50% of all packets when only one machine is plugged into its
ethernet jacks. I want to connect all my machines into the WRT, with the
WRT the only thing connected to the Actiontec, so I've managed to coax
the Actiontec into functioning by connecting a second PCMCIA ethernet
card to the Actiontec.

My question is this: Is it bad to run cat5 between a "LAN" port on the
WRT and a "LAN" port on the Actiontec? I don't need it to pass traffic
at all, I just want to avoid any possible negative consequences.

My first guess.

The Actiontec 1520 is broke..

Ditch it.

  I do need a new video card for my new box; apparently Soyo does not have
one built in.

  My research on the Web suggests that the ATI Radeon 7500 would be a good
purchase to use in an AGP slot that requires a 1.5v card.

So after that, there would be two cables between the two? If so, then
it could cause problems if they didn't implement spanning tree.

A Matrox G550 would probably look better in 2D and slow 3D mode, there
is kernel support for the dual heads too.  Not that the ATI is bad, just
that the Matrox looks very good doing everything but fast action 3D, the
ATI looks OK doing everything including fast action 3D.

Good Luck,

Subject: [PLUG] nvidia weirdness
Message-ID: <1094275562.3019.91.camel@fastlinux.homenet>

Hi all,

This is one of those "can anyone throw me a clue" weirdnesses.

I've got the 6111 version of the nvidia-kernel-source package from
Debian Unstable and compiled the new Nvidia drivers by executing

make-kpkg modules_image

from within the source directory of a working 2.6.4 kernel, I then
installed the .deb that was created by executing

dpkg -i nv*6.4*6111*

which was successful.  I then executed

/etc/init.d/gdm restart

and this was successful, the X-server went down, and came back up,
everything was fine and dandy.

Until I rebooted.  The Nvidia module failed to load and no X-server was
started.  I then executed

dpkg -i nv*6.4*6111*

which was successful.  I then executed

/etc/init.d/gdm restart

and this was successful as well, the X-server started right up, and ran
along just fine.

Sooo... I reboot, just to see what would happen.  No X-server.  Execute
the above incantation and it fires up just fine.  This is getting
annoying (and long winded).  

I can't think of what would cause this except some sort of race
condition as the kernel starts, so I get the current unstable kernel
source: 2.6.8.  I configured, compiled, installed, rebooted, (no
X-server, but that was expected) made the nvidia .deb, installed it and
rebooted again.  No X-server. Now I'm bumming.  It's not a big deal to
install the package each time it boots, but I usually like to run 4
X-servers and when they don't start on boot it takes a long time to
process the errors.

Anyone got a clue?  Is this a race condition in the kernel start up, or
just a configuration that isn't taking?

TIA,

Derek Loree

I can't comment on the Debian-specific stuff (my Gentoo box is the one
with the nvidia), but I had a problem somewhat like this. I found all I
had to do was 'modprobe nvidia' before starting the x-server. To do it
at boot, just add nvidia to /etc/modules.

Hope this helps,
Evan

Evan, that was not only a clue, that was the solution!  I wonder why it
won't autoload any more?

Derek,

  Thanks for the suggestion. At my age I'm not much into fast action 3D so
that's not an issue. Besides, even a massive wasting on a terrain model
doesn't move that quickly. And, the 3D simulations of a particle moving down
a river system are sufficiently quick even on my current nVidia Riva 128 (or
something like that. Actually, I could probably use this card, too, but I
don't know if it's a 1.5 v version (about 7 years old it is).

Derek,

  On various systems I've had processes fail to start upon booting. For
example, on my Toshiba Portege networking would not come up. In these
situations I put the initiation command at the end of /etc/rc.d/rc.local (or
whatever your local flavor calls it) and it works. It's not elegant but it's
quicker than agonizing over the why and wherefore.

It is not a 1.5 V card.  I have a client with glaucoma and he just loves
the Matrox cards, I have built 4 computers for him, all with Matrox
video.  They are not the cheapest cards, but sometimes quality is worth
the little extra cash.

Good Luck,

Rich,

I use gdm to start up the X-servers, and it is already at the end of the
startup order.  Just adding nvidia to /etc/modules seems to have fixed
it.

Subject: [PLUG] A Small K-8 LAN - Bascom?
Message-ID: <1094337964.7535.23.camel@dell.linux.box>

I inherited a network at a small K8 private school (5 classrooms, 5
teachers) and have run in to some issues.  At the moment, I'm on orders,
so am only really available to talk to individuals over the phone after
normal business hours.

Their network consists of approximately 50 Windows 98 computers and a
server.  They just upgraded from 56K dialup to DSL yesterday.  All the
systems plug in to a single 10BaseT hub.

The systems then access the Internet through an old server running
'Bascom'.  nmap identified it as Linux-based.  It's running 2.4.20 or
so.  I haven't yet booted with a rescue CD to attempt to identify the
underlying distribution.

It isn't working.  Packets are filtered through the box, utilizing some
bridge/firewall software I'm not familiar with.  Currently web access
absolutely crawls - the box is, simply put, lagging.

What I haven't yet been able to determine (they don't know) is if the
school is paying a continued support license of some sort for the system
and if there's anything bascom provides (that is actually used) that I
can't simply replicate, myself, with Slackware, Squid, DansGuardian,
ClamAV, and a nice iptables script.

Is anybody familiar with what Bascom provides, and if they do charge a
continuing fee or if it's buy once, use forever?  I am, thus far, not
horribly impressed by it.

On another note, due to the age of so many of the systems and there
inherent issues (I did help clean up a virus about two years ago on
their LAN), I wonder if utilizing K12LTSP might be a worthwhile
endeavor.  They don't currently have either the budget or the iron to
run K12LTSP on a single system, serving out to the whole LAN, so I
wonder if a more distributed solution might be in order...

I'd love to replace MS Office on those systems with OpenOffice or
similar, but OO is *so* sluggish on modern systems I know these systems
wouldn't be able to handle it.  They're all 32-64MB of RAM, Pentium or
Pentium II systems, none over 300MHz that I've seen.

Thoughts?  Suggestions?  Experiences with Bascom?

If this is something you've been charged with fixing, I'd recommend you
start out by replacing it with IPCop.  Quickly installs to HDD from CD,
a basic red/green setup will get folks going and you can fine-tune it
from a web browser on the green (inside) network.

The IPCop box will tide you over 'til you make your way-cool Super Custom
Extra-Nifty firewall.  You can even install DansGuardian on it to
protect the kiddies from Nasty Stuff.

Would be a good thing to try as a pilot project, at least.  At Free Geek
Collaborative Technologies, we run a nice li'l LTSP box for our office
and love it.  You need about a GHz (or dual-500s) and 1+ GB RAM to get
decent performance with 10s of terminals, but that's not a hard spec to
meet.  That's like, what, $200 at Fry's?

Let me know if you wanna swing by some time and checkiddout.  You're
right, it'd be good to have at least a couple of servers so you're not
totally dead in the water when a server dies.

Perfect terminals, then.  Ours are 200MHz.  I'm surprised you haven't
started losing them to disk failure, though.

AF Reserves.  I'm busy during the work day and can't get on the phone
during Bascom's tech support hours (they close at 3PM our time).  I
should have explained that better.  :-)

Yup.  Of course, that doesn't actually tell us what it does so much.

I think I'll contact the teachers and find out if they even know the
software is there.  If not, it's gone...

I haven't had any experience with IPCop, so will probably utilize a nice
Slackware install with my iptables script and squid/squidguard or
DansGuardian to filter stuff out.  Either that or I'll talk them in to
spending $50 on a cheapo DSL router.

A gig of RAM alone will run you close to $200.  The cheapest CPUs Fry's
have are all over $50.  $10 for a HSF.  $30 for a case (online, Fry's
doesn't have cheap cases), etc, etc... I'm currently building fairly
barebones systems for about $350 in hardware.  Unfortunately I also must
pay the Microsoft tax on these systems.  :-(

I wonder how best to implement something like that with multiple
servers.  I should play around with it a bit...

Exactly; they're great terminals.  They're not good for much else,
though.  :-)

I'm surprised we haven't had a ton of disk failures, as well.  Happily
surprised.  Most of the systems were expensive workstations in their
day, though.

I think the best 2D cards are still Matrox.  There's kernel drivers for
all that stuff (I have a G450 that I love).

The only tiny unfortunate thing is that the mga_vid driver that supports
the backend scaler for video resizing (not important for X, but makes
images BEAUTIFUL for DVD and other video playback) doesn't compile for
2.6, so you're stuck with 2.4 series kernels.

Those are my cents.

Aaron,

I think for the second part what you would like to look for is
bridging.  If both interfaces were on the same machine you should be
able to bridge them together to make one virtual interface and thus
share the connection.  There in no doubt many ways to achieve this but
I think creating a bridge between two interfaces on the same machine
to be the correct path.  You should be able to even create a bridge on
one machine that would point to two other machines.  What I don't know
if the bridge will manage the workload and/or split packets for
performance.

Others here should be able to answer that question.

Josh

Josh,

Thanks for the input, however bridging is not what I'm looking for. I want
an intelligent routing solution that will take a browser's requests for
objects over HTTP and split them among more than one logical internet
connection. I'd really like something that could take all TCP sessions and
load balance them over multiple logical internet connections. This process
would create a single virtual internet connection for the network which
uses NAT, so the end computers don't know they are using multiple
connections to retrieve data faster.

Sorry for not being more specific the first time.

See: 

  <http://lartc.org/>

Basically what you want (I think) is for your IP masquerading to
round-robin connections or some other load balancing strategy.  That
sounds doable, but I don't know exactly how off the top of my head.
Check out the lartc site referenced above for some ideas.

I've got two connections upstream (a DSL and a Cable).  I "load
balance" using static routes.  Connections to some destinations go one
way, to other destinations they go the other way.  The biggest problem
I had was routing inbound connections to internal machines.  On the
outbound reply, normal destination-based routing often sends them out
the wrong interface (not matching the inbound packets) causing the
connection to fail.  I solved the problem using fwmarks and associated
ip "rules".

It's not possible to have, for example, two 1Mbs connections and
download a single file at 2Mbs because of the way TCP/IP works.  But
if you have two users downloading a file then one user can be directed
out the first WAN connection and the other user can be directed out
the second WAN connection.  Here's some info on multiple connections
with Linux:

There may be better ways, like a tool that would split out the animation into seperate images.
Like gifsicle, http://www.lcdf.org/~eddietwo/gifsicle/

Gimp works with animated gifs through layers.  Open up the Layers dialog and you'll see the sequence of images.

Well, it is *possible*, with upstream cooperation.  There used to be
(and maybe still is) kernel support for doing this with dialup modems.
It just isn't practical or (as far as I know) available.

It's completely *possible*. Of course, you'll need to own your own
netblock and then get an AS routing number and be prepared to handled
BGP at your border. None of which you can get on consumer broadband at
all.

As Russell points out, on narrowband you can use EQL, but again, only
if upstream supports it.

Just HTTP may actually be possible. I saw a setup that impressed me
(though never got to see if it worked well [or at all]) where you put
a squid on each line and then run a master squid doing ICP balancing
between them.

Although I just remembered to add that you have to be careful in the
balancing with remote sites that remember application state (such as
for shopping carts) based on IP.

Thanks!

I am in the process of creating my own low-res "Visible Human" from an
NLM-derived animated GIF.  I need to model a person on a

Subject: [PLUG] Request Debian Install Help
Message-ID: <1094501010.3031.20.camel@hermes.freegeek.org>

I have an HP Pavilion ZD7058CL laptop and am getting most frustrated
trying to install Debian on a partition. I currently have boot
partitions set aside for Debian, Fedora, and Mandrake.

I am attempting to use a NetInstall CD dated 2004-09-05 (I downloaded it
yesterday) and, like the other CDs I have attempted to install, it
consistently hangs on the first boot (but not on the installer CD) right
when it tries to load the Firewire Ethernet driver.

Now I didn't tell it to use that - I specified the Realtek driver for
eth0 - but it is still loading it. I have gone with the default install,
linux26 acpi=off, linux26 noapic nolapic, and a bunch of other variants,
but no joy. It always hangs on trying to load the Firewire Ethernet
driver.

So in Mandrake, I go over to /initrd/ (I have / mounted as /debian under
Mandrake) and there ain't nobody home. Over in /boot/grub, I see:

device.map     jfs_stage1_5  minix_stage1_5     stage1  xfs_stage1_5
e2fs_stage1_5  menu.lst      reiserfs_stage1_5  stage2

And wandering through the grub morass (What was wrong with lilo, dammit?
I understood lilo and grub seems to be needlessly complex) I list out
the files and there isn't anything there that I can make sense of except
menu.lst.

So, oh great Debian gurus, what the hell do I need to do to install
Debian on my laptop?

Not so needlessly when you make a mistake in your configuration and
you can *correct it at boot time*. (I typically forget to copy my
initrd into the right place, but I just use grub to go find the file
on the right filesystem.)

Probably muck about in the "Ethernet drivers" package and remove the
bit you don't want. I actually *just* (Debian installs last a really
long time, so I don't usually) did an install with debian-installer,
but from floppies. You might also try installing 2.4 and working your
way up to 2.6 afterwards.

Asking here does offer the advantage of reaching people who might be

And Aaron Burt has made the interesting suggestion (which I am about to
try) of moving S36discover from /etc/rcS.d to a "discarded"
subdirectory. I'll post the results here. Any other suggestions would be
appreciated.

An alternative is simply to move it to s36discover, as only scripts
with a capital S or capital K get run.

This really does sound like an issue for the debian-installer folks
(debian-boot) because it may well be a bug that they need to fix
before sarge goes live.

You're right, of course. I'll try to remember to send off a message to
them after I learn whether it works or not.

Actually that's not true. There is residual effects on the edges in a 3D
mode from a dual monitor standpoint on the ATI. Matrox doesn't have that
particular issue.

A Matrox G550 would probably look better in 2D and slow 3D mode, there is
kernel support for the dual heads too.  Not that the ATI is bad, just that
the Matrox looks very good doing everything but fast action 3D, the ATI
looks OK doing everything including fast action 3D.

Good Luck,

Hello all,

I have 6 Dell dual Pentium Pro motherboards, 10 200 MHz Pentium Pro
processors (256K cache), 6 heatsinks, 6 clips, and 6 CPU continuity cards.
I have no use for them, I was planning to dabble in clustered computing,
but the motherboards need risers to use PCI devices, which I was unable to
locate at a decent price.

If anyone is interested in any of this hardware, it's free for the taking.
I'll ship it somewhere or you can pick it up. I'm in Hillsboro, by Glencoe
High School.

(I wrote this before reading your message about removing discover. This
might be useful anyway)

Write down the message it gives you on boot. Then, with the debian
partition mounted on /debian, do this: (replace $MSG with some part of
the message you get)

# grep $MSG /debian/etc/rc?.d/*

Track down which of those scripts is giving you the message, and then
delete the symlinks:

# rm /debian/etc/rc?.d/*offending-script-name

Then you should be able to boot and eventually figure out why that was
making it hang. You should probably submit a bug report about this.

You might also check various logs to diagnose the exact problem.

Hmm.  Okay, new problem.  Each of the frames covers a subset of the

I.e.  I get a 99x125 pixel GIF, but I seem to lose the offset
information when I subsequently convert to a txt format.  The command:

   $ convert frame_018.gif frame_018.txt

results in a frame_018.txt that begins like this:

   # ImageMagick pixel enumeration: 99,125,255,RGB
   0,0: (  0,  0,  0) black
   1,0: (  0,  0,  0) black
   2,0: (  0,  0,  0) black
   3,0: (  0,  0,  0) black
   [...]

I want each frame to be located at the correct position in the larger
image so that (ultimately) voxels are aligned properly.  That is, I
want what is:

  #ImageMagick pixel enumeration: 347,200,255,RGB
  [...]
  125,31: (  0,  0,  0) black
  126,31: (  0,  0,  0) black
  127,31: (  0,  0,  0) black
  128,31: (  0,  0,  0) black
  [...]

where those four pixels represent the same ones as in the previous
example.  I am having some trouble locating the correct incantation or
incantations.

Subject: [PLUG] NFS problem..
Message-ID: <413D80CD.80000@spek.org>

Hello,
   I've got a problem nfs mounting a remote file system after reboots of 
my main workstation - I've had this problem about 4 times, each time 
after a reboot.  Since reboots are months apart I forget what I did the 
last time and each time I google up an answer that fixes my problem but 
I never write it down because I'm "too busy" and will "do it later". 
This time my google-fu is very weak it appears and I cannot seem to 
google up an answer and I'm hoping somebody will be able to at least 
point me in the right direction.

When I:
   mount 192.168.1.4:/web        /web
I get this error:
   mount: RPC: Remote system error - No route to host

Some references I've found have made mentionings that it's the firewall 
blocking what shouldn't be but I get the same error even if I clear the 
firewall rules

The workstation is rh9, the server is fc1, if that makes a difference.

thanks for any help,

--Brent

A loss of context (what are you trying to do in the grand scheme of it
all anyway? what's with the conversion to .txt?) may make this answer
sub-optimal.

The identify command would give you offset information if you didn't
capture it when you did the covert.  For the sample frame that is
125+31.  You could then use that information when layering the 
images back together or modify your .txt file to add the offsets
to the x,y that begin each line.

Message-ID: <1094563449.9681.7.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I'm looking for a provider of Linux compatible pci based internal modems
that can answer the phone.  Even a serial modem could work.  Is there
a secret to finding a cheap external modem that works with vgetty?

I'm running into digium and asterisk and something called the Wildcard
X100P.  I'm having a hard time telling what exactly what the Wildcard
X100P is and am wondering also why it costs $100?

It doesn't seem to be rocket science that the common person doesn't
want to buy a $100 pci card to answer the phone with.  Is the 
purpose of the Wildcard X100P to do VoIP or something else fancy?

Does PBX infer something that switches phone calls onto other
telecommunications equipment?

What does "/sbin/chkconfig --list portmap" show on the workstation? 
You should see "on" in runlevels 3, 4, and 5. If not, you'll need to 
start the portmapper ("/etc/init.d/portmap start").

Alternatively, if you've got an fstab entry for your nfs mount, you 
can use Red Hat's standard netfs script:

   /etc/init.d/netfs start

It'll make sure the portmap is running before trying to do nfs mounts.

portmap is shown as on for runlevels 3, 4, and 5, and is currently running.

It is in my fstab but I get the same error for all the various methods

Maybe it would clarify the thread to ask, when do you have to have
the same ip you had in an earlier transmission?  Do you need to keep
the same ip for a single ip communication or can shopping carts
etc. get messed up when one communication uses ip a with the next
communication using ip b?

Maybe the answer if you have 1 subnet is to use three routers to
do this.  Assign all of them a global ip in a single subnet and 
have one of them be the origin of all packets, hence all packets
come from the same ip regardless of the broadband path used.  
Unfortunately, I don't know any Internet Service Providers 
that will combine two cable or dsl connections let alone a 
mixed cable and dsl connections in one ip subnet.  

A thought is to dynamically set a unique ip on one of your two broadband
gateways at a time, but this won't help if you have two subnets for your
two cable connections.  Why ISP's don't allow customers to do two cable
or DSL connections in one subnet has puzzled me for quite some time. 
Couldn't the ISP just take a single ip out of the pools the customer has
usually paid for despite going bridged and route any packets from those
two subnets through that ip on their end?  Even if you had to pay 
$5 a month to get an ip on the ISP end that they route your multiple
broadband connections out through, that wouldn't be so bad.  Considering
that most broadband accounts through the same provider work over the
same telco equipment and that increasing the connection speed on one 
is commonly available, why use two Cable or DSL connections anyways?

What you really need is an ISP that will bridge two DSL 
connections together.  Trouble is, how many people can afford the
cost of two phone lines?  Two phone lines in
Scappoose costs a minimum of $26/month running $65 the first month, 
add another $24/month if you want to be able to place a telephone call
anywhere in the Portland area at a reasonable price on either line.
The routers at Opus apparently can't do two DSL connections together
at a time.  If you can use a global ip from one of your subnets over
the other subnet, your ISP is opening up all kinds of abuse vectors.
The ISP sets each broadband account up on a subnet and for security
reasons probably doesn't allow you to use any ip numbers other than
the ones they assigned to the account your currently going out 
through.  If ISP's would dump customer end ip networking opting 
perhaps for Novell's IPX protocol instead, maybe the combining
problems could be solved.

should go about sending the video signal to the TV itself. The video card
that is currently set up in the machine is an ATI card. It has a TV out
port. The downside is that the X driver for ATI doesn't support the TV out
port. My question is this: Does the NVIDIA driver support TV out? 
 
I Googled around briefly this morning and found VGA to RCA adapters. Is this
the best way to go?

Thanks Matt, I am learning a lot from lartc.org. I wonder why google
didn't find it for me. I have heard of making HTTP proxies use range
headers to get parts of a file over multiple connections, making it
possible to download a single file at 2mbps over two 1mbps connections.
However, there doesn't seem to be much in the way of open source software
(that I can find) at this time to do such a thing.

I'm fairly familiar with the HTTP protocol and it's something I may want
to explore coding myself one of these days, but for now I will use the
load balancing howto on the lartc.org website.

Thanks again for the URLs.

Is there any content in /etc/hosts.{deny,allow} on the server or the 
client that'd prevent connections? The portmap uses libwrap to limit 
connections.

Does syslog record anything on the server that indicates why the 
client was unsuccessful?

I went through this recently. At the time (a few months ago) there were
no software solutions I could find that worked with 2.6 kernels and
xorg's X server. (They all wanted 2.4 and/or XFree86.) So I went with the 
hardware solution, a VGA to TV converter. The quality is pretty good 
compared to my low expectations. Still I consider it a temporary solution 
until the software catches up. If you're interested I can look up the make 
and model when I get home. I think it cost around $90.

I notice some high-end TVs now come with DVI input. So if you're video
card has DVI-out then that's an option.

Both the webcam and the doppler are very large images. Could you resize

NVIDIA does support TV out. I have the FX5200 and I am running MythTV with the FX5200 sending signal to the TV. See Appendix J of the document...

    I have a box set up next to my TV in living room that I want to connect to my Home Entertainment system. I am having trouble with figuring how I should go about sending the video signal to the TV itself. The video card that is currently set up in the machine is an ATI card. It has a TV out port. The downside is that the X driver for ATI doesn't support the TV out port. My question is this: Does the NVIDIA driver support TV out? 
 
I Googled around briefly this morning and found VGA to RCA adapters. Is this the best way to go?


Thanks,

Chris

Yeah, a Google for "vgetty modem" and two clicks:

I wondered that a while ago, and asked Google.  It found some
mailing-list messages that said why, and a webpage or two that pointed
to an alternative that cost $28.  I don't remember where they are, but
ya know, you could Google for them...

Nope.

PBX means Private Branch Exchange.  Practically, it's something you plug
phones into so they can dial each other, or dial out to real phone
numbers.  In other words, the typical sort of phone switch system you'd
find in an office.

Ya know, I really shouldn't enable your habit of wasting people's time
instead of looking up stuff yourself.  

Oh well,

You bet. The biggest is the OSU webcam; it's a real-time streaming
web-cam. I think I will make the "thumnail" a still webcam image and
have it link to the streaming version.

no, neither the server nor client syslog say anything when trying to mount.

is there some way to make mount output something more useful?

IMHO; this type of thing is where linux fails.

Best resolution:
DVI->HDTV capable of 720p. You can run windows at 1024x720, and it looks

Well, since the company I work for has written something similar for
us to do file caching I can say that it is possilbe.  He have our file
format that we need to download over HTTP from many possible servers
with the same data.  We wrote our own client and server to achieve
this but I suppose the same logic could be used in a proxy machine to
break up the HTTP request from a client and split them out to multiple
routes and then return the request back to the client.
This really would only be good if the server supported a call for a
partial request.  Not sure if HTTP servers do that by default.  Like I
said.  We wrote our own server to send only pieces of a binary file as
requested from the client.
Would be interesting if that did work by default in Apache.  Could
save a lot of time.

Subject: [PLUG] Quick And Dirty Network Profiling
Message-ID: <20040907131142.2b044d2f.jason@vancleve.com>

First off, I am not a system admin', but I rent a server on
SprocketData.  Normally, I use about 0% of my included bandwidth, but
last month I used nearly ten gig's, around nine of which were consumed
between August 17th and August 19th.  The trend this month is also
disturbing.  So evidently I've picked up some species of parasite.

I ran chkrootkit, and no problems showed up; and my FTP system looks to
be in order.  (I know, FTP is "bad", but it hasn't been a problem.)

So I'm guessing someone has figured out how to spam through my SMTP
relay, but with so much spam bouncing around, it's hard to tell from my
mail logs what's going on.  I'm just not sure how to diagnose this, and
I'd appreciate some pointers.

To begin with, I'd like a quick and dirty network monitor by which I can
see where all that bandwidth is going.  A high-level, packets-per-port
type thing will do, something I can run for a few days and then check
the averages.  Could just be that someone has found something they liked
in one of my Web sites and told all their friends. . . .

If I determine it is indeed my mail service, how might I determine how
it's being abused?  I run postfix 1.1.11 on this Mandrake 9.1.I.think
system.  For all I know, it could be one of my few mail users trying to
send a really big attachment, or something like that, but I rather
suspect it's a spammer.

Any advice for a simple programmer?  Thanks,

Assuming that your box isn't compromised, take a look at ntop:
http://www.ntop.org

Takes a bit of setting up, but it will show you traffic stats over time
on a per protocol/port basis.

If you're running iptables as a firewall on the box[1] you can set it up to
log traffic through the firewall, cron a save every few hours, and compare
iterations to see what rule is getting exercised.

pflogsumm is very good at summarizing postfix logs - it will identify top
senders and receivers by message and byte count.

Since you're running a web server (assuming apache) you can grab whatever
weblog summary tool and see what files (images?) are being downloaded.
Alternatively a little Perlfu for 200, success,  messages and you can 
extract what web stuff is the bulk of your outbound bytes.

Are you getting a lot of spam?  If your bandwidth is measured both ways
you might be getting billed for the priviledge of spammers sending you 
their stuff.

What I am trying to do is to create a voxel (voxel being the 3d
generalization of a 2d pixel) model of a human body.  I am starting
with an animated gif, which traverses head-to-toe slices of a frozen
cadaver.  Non-black indicates tissue (it's actually much more colorful
than that, eeew!).  I don't care about discriminating between
different kinds of tissue (bone, muscle, fat, organs, etc).  Stack up
all the slices and you've got your 3d model.

Michael> The identify command would give you offset information if you

Ah, okay I missed "identify".  It seems unnecessarily awkward to have
to reinsert this information that is clearly already embedded in the
file, but that of course ought to work.

GIMP has a command "gimp-layer-resize-to-image-size", which also
works, or would if one figures out the script-fu mess (and I
personally *like* scheme, there is just too much guesswork involved in
figuring out how to interface with GIMP data structures and functions).  

Not finding the programmatic method, I loaded all the images in GIMP
and fingered my way through: M-l i C-s C-w.  With all the images in a
stack, it wasn't too bad, as C-w closed the top image and the mouse
pointer selected the next one in line.

I feel so dirty.

For your information, I got the information I put in my post by googling
dork.  Searching on vgetty modem is not the most obvious way to find the
type of modem I want to be looking at, but thanks anyways.  Does it
matter that I've done a lot of looking on ebay in hopes of finding a
modem that will do voice under Linux?  You know what, never mind.

I believe Apache supports this "out of the box." It's what enables
"resuming downloads" for all those poor folk on slow lines that download
big files.

Message-ID: <1094615410.16852.55.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

My ISP said upgrade to 768/256 for $5 less/month.  Well, I don't know
if there's something wrong with my DSL-500 router made by Cisco or
if the phone company is having problems.  I rarely see even 500k
on the http://opuscreative.com speedometer.  I think we got pretty 
close to 450k or better when we were 512/256 customers on a fairly
frequent basis.  The average seems to be around 300k according to 
opus's speedometer after the upgrade.  I'm wondering if I've gone 
too far from the NID only to find that I don't do any better plugged
directly into it.  If I had consistently done better at a range
of three feet from the NID, I was seriously considering running
ethernet and permanently relocating the router in garage cabinets
directly behind it.  I was going to bypass about a hundred feet
or so of wiring.  Maybe there's nothing wrong with my CAT5 phone
lines.

There's a serial line on this baby and you can access it with
hyperterminal.  I'm wondering if there's something simple to
do like change a speed setting or something.  I'd love to
know how to get into this unit using minicom.  Trouble is, I 
don't have the programming manual for it when I do get in 
there and I don't know how to make a backup.  My router is
called the DSL-500 and appears to be a Cisco product.  It's
considered old, but I'm not verry happy with my ISP telling
me I might want to buy a new router.  Give me the router
in exchange for the one I have for a short while, maybe. 
If the new one works and works better, I'll consider 
paying a reasonable difference.  Did they purposely 
upgrade to a different enough DSL in hopes of selling 
their new routers?

Maybe the digital cable that has been run nearly to the 
house isn't such a bad idea after all.  Is it comcast
now?  I know the guy said that the network is out of
Warren or something.

Following up on myself...

I'm using the AVerKey iMicro. It has VGA input, and RCA and S-Video 
(formerly S-VHS) output. I'm running MythTV at 800x600 on a 21-inch
TV using the RCA output. (My TV doesn't support S-Video.) It's horrible
as a regular computer display but looks good watching TV. Again, it's a
temporary solution. When I'm ready to get that new HDTV I'll rethink the
whole thing.

well I fixed the problem - as it turned out PEBCAK was the real issue: 
there was firewall issues on the server.  I don't know why the firewall 
rules on the server didn't effect the nfs mount before the client 
rebooted though, that may forever be a mystery.

Subject: [PLUG] Transcontinental ping times? for distributed symphonies
Message-ID: <20040908172215.GA3960@gate.kl-ic.com>

This isn't a Linux question, but I'm sure somebody here knows somebody
who knows the answer.

Question:  With fast machines at each end, and fat pipes running close
to the main internet hubs, what is the fastest ping times seen running
from coast to coast?

The fastest I see from my laptop, through my slow firewall and
comcast and 14 other switches,  to ftp.uu.net in Virginia is 91
msec.  The round trip speed of light delay between here and
Virginia (as the glass-bound photon flies) is around 50 msec. 
My packets are taking a right turn in Seattle (up to 53 msec),
so it appears that my own coast-coast time is only 72% higher than
the raw speed of light delay.  The ping time to my slow firewall is
11 msec, so that suggests that from the cable modem to uunet and
back (through SEA1.ALTER.NET in seattle) is only 80msec, which is
only 51% more than the speed-of-light delay.  Still, I expect
the RT delay between fast machines near SEA and IAD would be
close to the ideal 50 msec.  A microwave link would be even
faster (air is faster than glass).    Does anybody know?


The reason I ask is because I am interested in the theoretical 
possibility of a distributed symphony.  The speed-of-sound delay
across a large stage is similar to internet propagation delay across
the country;  solve some latency and QOS issues, and come up with some
kind of conductor/score-reader system, and perhaps do some kind of
"video-sync-to-rehersal" to take care of visual cues, and it is
possible to put together a performance of perhaps 1000 musicians
scattered throughout the country.  Given all this raw musical data,
individual sound engineers (and you and me) could select which 
subset of musicians to sync and mix together to create a single
performance.  The really fun possibilities would occur when you
combined data from different eras - what would performer A in 2004
sound like playing with performer B in 2024?  

While such a capability would be useful to the Big Bad Recording
Companies, it would be far more useful for "open source" performances.
In time, individual music consumers would have interactive, editing
access to a treasure trove of free performances from public-domain
scores.  I suspect such a capability would liberate a lot of musical
creativity, and be another killer app for open source. 

The fact that it might also deprive the record company kopyright
kops of an income stream would be a major disappointment to us all,
of course.  :-)

Keith, this is one of the kewlest ideas I have heard in a long, long

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0409081104570.4220@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   After losing a hard drive on Sunday (and having the other one act
strangely), I've been pre-occupied with getting my server up and running
again. I had not intended to make a drastic, sudden change from RH 7.3 to
Slackware 10.0, but here I am.

   I think crucial services (such as smtp) are running again. However, there
are many niggling issues to resolve. The main one now is getting pine to run
correctly on the console.

   Every time a new message comes in the system speaker beeps and the display
is messed up. Also, the messages are not properly processed by procmail
recipes. They all end up in my inbox with no text content and addressed (by
the MLM) to 'undisclosed recipients'.

   This is pine-4.60.

   After I get this fixed I'll work on getting X running again, figure out
why it won't work with the Kensington Orbit trackball, and test/re-install
all other applications.

   All suggestions about the immediate mail problem with pine will be very
much appreciated.

Many thanks,

Rich

Good news!  I believe I'm NOT being abused by spammers.  Deep sigh of
relief:  I'd hate to be part of THAT problem.)  pflogsumm shows
consistent output for those three high-traffic days last month.

My apache logs seem to indicate the problem:  multiple downloads of some
classic guitar MP3s I'm serving by HTTP.  I traced a few of the IPs, and
most seem to come from Japan; so I guess someone has linked the files on
a Jap' Web site somewhere.  Looks like I'll need to activate some HTTP
authentication for those directories.

Many thanks for all your help.  Linux geeks rule!

Try mod_bandwidth or mod_throttle.

I had problems with Pine when I switched to RH 9. The problem turned out 
to be that the new system default for text was unicode instead of the 
simplier ASCII (or ANSI). Change your environment variable to $LANG=en_US. 
THere's a config file somewhere in /etc where this can be done more 
properly, but of course, now I can't find my notes.

Very cool idea!

~83ms pings to Oregon State University, in Corvallis.  Pinging
uoregon.edu (which I think serves OSU's network) shaves about 2 ms off

Targeting ucsd.edu (San Diego) comes in at about 86-87 on average, but
the median is 85.  This came as a bit of a surprise to me, I hadn't
expected the network to be so fast (or direct, or whatever is causing
only a 5 ms difference accross 1000 miles) in SoCal compared to
Oregon.  The stdev. is higher going to ucsd though. (about 2.5)

Keith adds a small note:  NYC to PDX probably uses fiber links routed
through Seattle.  There is very likely another link going directly
from NYC to LA  ( a "traceroute" would tell you ).  The straight line
distances are within a few percent of each other.

This is demonstrated by air travel - from Portland to Boston is about
8 hours travel time, stopping at a hub, while direct flights from Boston
to LAX take 6 hours in fast widebodies.  Direct routes have advantages.

The short answer: I can get ca. 69ms to Florida from Oregon.

The long answer: From OGI's network, connected to the wider net both 
via Internet/2 and a decent AT&T pipe, here are some ping times (ping 
-q -c 4 HOSTNAME):

West coast:

* limestone.uorgon.edu       3.855 ms
* www3.cac.washington.edu    4.826 ms

Mountain west:

* cujo.colorado.edu         31.426 ms
* ns.utah.edu               42.293 ms

Mid-west:

* nss.nts.umn.edu           75.623 ms
* hm.missouri.edu           45.651 ms

Now, on to the east coast:

* www.mit.edu               79.749 ms
* kedu.cc.columbia.edu      83.845 ms
* dukedns1.netcom.duke.edu  87.162 ms

Is that really a good option?  Maybe these leeches won't mind waiting
half a day to download my files.  Besides, it would probably frustrate
my intended users as much as a login would.

Bill,

   I'm aware of the LANG problem (UTF8 is the default now instead of en_US).
I ran 'export LANG=en_US" when fighting SpamAssassin to get that working
again, and that's the way it's set when I 'echo $LANG'.

   I, too, forget where it's permanently set.

Thanks,

Rich

I think mod_rewrite lets you rewrite URLs based on the referring URL...
IMHO, that would be a far better option than mod_bandwidth,
mod_throttle, or HTTP authentication.

Just so's you know, I ran my Matrox G450 dual-head through a TV for a
couple of years with very nice results.  I mean, I wouldn't run my email
there or anything, but the video output with SDL looked quite nice.

Yep! It seems awesome.. worked just as well as the others, with new 
features, I'm sure. I didn't at poke it much, just used it to format a 
HD. Typed 'linux26' at the prompt to get a 2.6 kernel.. just for 
coolness factors.
There seems to be lots of fancy animations and such in KDE as well.. 
don't know how much he hacked it; its a much newer KDE than I've ever used.

   Having had to completely restore my server/workstation -- a work still in
progress -- I've experienced a bunch of hardware and software issues that
have not been seen here before.

   The most annoying one is something screwy with syslog.conf (attached) that
allows all new incoming mail messages to activate the system speaker and
overwrite the screen (in console mode) for each new message. I'd greatly
appreciate learning why and what to do to stop this behavior. I've not seen
this in the years I've been running linux.

Thaniks, folks,

Rich, 

How did you make a connection from syslog configuration to mail arrival
alerting?  

check your system for biff or xbiff, check your email reader (pine?) for
its default action on mail arrival.  Both of those have a vastly greater
possibility of beeping and blanking than syslog.

Michael,

   Because syslogd controls where messages should go. This was suggested to
me by someone much more experienced than I and whose knowledge is always
reliable.

   'locate' finds a bunch of biffs; mostly associated with Qt.

   The ~/.pinerc is from the backup tape so it hasn't changed the pine
configuration with the new 4.60 version.

I don't see anything amiss. I guess you could try commenting out all 
mentions of mail.* to see if that provides temporary relief -- but I 
doubt it will.

I'd be interested to see the output of "ps xa"; my initial hunch is 
that some process other than syslog is monitoring inbound mail...

Hi,

Just curious, how does this breakdown?  Is it mostly fibre 
propagation?  The speed of light
is about 300000 km/s _in a vacuum but it's slower in fibre and varies by 
media and mode.  Portland to the New Jersey shore is just under 2500 miles 
but that's line of sight and the cable is anything but.  Then there's the 
delay between telling bash to get the ping utility and the photons or 
electrons coming out of the NIC as well as the lag for the service at the 
other end.  There must be lots of physical layer devices along the path to 
amplify the signal.  What else?

TIA,
Mike

Your ~/.pinerc is trustably the same. Perhaps a default action of pine

Charlie,

   Aha! Another newly learned tool. Yes, biff returns 'y'. According to the
man page it can be turned off, but there are no instructions for how to do
that.

   So, I ran '/usr/bin/biff n' and it makes no difference.

Thanks,

Rich

Very interesting idea.  Thanks, I'll give that some thought.  I've
linked these MP3s from my blog, so it would be nice to keep that working

Not sure.. (man biff?)

Charlie,

   Well, 'biff' reports 'n', but the march of mail across the console
continues. Ergo, it ain't biff.

Sigh.  Thanks,

You could also try the 'html head' section in cricket-config/Defaults,
so you don't have to hack up executables :)

Subject: [PLUG] Three questions
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0409091123450.13187@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   1.) How do I debug why RealPlayer no longer provides audio? It used to --
on my Sony Vaio portable -- but now it won't. I just upgraded from
RealPlayer8 to RealPlayer10. I see video but I hear no sounds.

   Running 'aumix' and setting volume and speaker to 100 makes loud speaker
beeps when I press the incorrect key; it makes no difference with a feed to
which I'm trying to listen. I've no idea why it stopped working. This is
slackware-10.0 running.

   2.) What command do I use to invoke firefoz-0.9.3 on the same system? If I
use /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox I don't get a regular browser window open, but
one with a list of icons and options. This was installed from the
firefox-0.9.3 slackware package.

   3.) Anyone running Xfce4? If so, have you figured out how to obtain the
same behaviors that Xfce3 used to provide? Specifically, how do I save the
session so that the same applications open on the same virtual desktops when
I startx?

Thanks,

Rich

For me, the command is just 'firefox'.  It's more likely to be in /usr/bin
or /usr/local/bin then in /usr/lib.  If you installed a private firefox
(as I did), then it will be in whichever directory you installed firefox.

Can you get a small netblock for setting up behind your two broadband
connections in order to facilitate using the same ip all the time 
reagrdless of which braoadband connection you go out through?

/===========\                       ----------------------------------
| non       |            |---R2-----| global subnet with broadband 1 |
| broadband |            |          ----------------------------------
| related   |------------|
| global    |            |          ----------------------------------
| subnet.   |            |---R3-----| global subnet with broadband 2 |
\===========/                       ----------------------------------
      |
      R1         
      |              
   -----------
   | private |
   | subnet  | 
   -----------

R1, R2, and R3 are routers.  R1 gets you to the first global subnet
which uses either router R2 or R3 to go out onto the Internet.  If
all three of these global subnets aren't unique on the Internet,
this approach won't work.  With ipv6 coming out, it's a shame ISP's
can't just give out entire ipv4 netblocks now cheap.

Alternatively, if you have a site with more than one broadband user
you might set assignments that place half the users on one connection
and the rest of them on the other connection.

I like the idea of a smarter masquerading scheme though where one
masq gateway using one of the connections tells the other what 
it is doing so that via round robin dns perhaps, the replay can 
come in on the other line.  I'm thinking of a scheme where
masq gate 2 is aware of masq gate 1's port mappings.  I think the
problem with this scheme is that tcp connections don't come from
two machines.

I'm trying to make a software based router(with NAT?) that I can
forward all traffic on one port to another machine on another port and
back.  This would be like an invisible proxy.  I would like to be able
to use Java as I need to support 6 different OS's.

Suggestions?  Is there an existing one or can I use something in
Apache.  It appears that apache only forwards HTTP traffic.  I need to
forward all traffic on a particular port.  All I know is that it will
be TCP/IP traffic.  The rest is unknown and could change.

I have found Zebra Router software and started to look into that as a
solution.  Other ideas would help.

Thanks,

Josh

So all you want to do is forward TCP/IP traffic through one port?
That's easy. I have found this to work for me:

thanks Evan.  This works.  I'll need to adjust and build for all OS
but I could also use it as a simple demo for what I want to achieve
using Java.

I believe what you're talking about is called "port-forwarding".
Normally, that's a function of the routing/firewalling code on the box,
but if it's gotta be the same on all platforms, I'm sure you can write a
simple Java app that binds to a port like any other server and just
forwards the data.

Note that there will likely be restrictions on what port a Java app is
allowed to bind to.

Me, I'd just set it up with IPTables, but that's Linux-only.

The biff setting is per terminal. Running
`find /dev/pts -user $USER -exec chmod u-x {} \;` should stop
notification on all your terminals, unless this console is on one of the
other devices. (FYI doing chmod u-x `tty` is equiv to biff n, and
chmod u+x `tty` is equiv to biff y)

Yes it is port-forwarding.  Forgot the lingo.  I'm actually trying to
run it as a service on my java Application to forward a particular
request to another server.  I most likely will be writting this in
java but was wondering if anyone else has done this before.

I have since found a few that I could get an idea from.  The Simple
Proxy C code is a great proof of concept that I can use today for a
demo and I'll write the other code in Java.

Thanks,

Josh

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0409091624411.9285@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've tried to specify the monitor resolution as 1260x960[1] but every
application that opens in its own window (e.g,. mozilla, lyx) is huge. The
window frames, menu bar, tool bar and and text (in LyX) are as large as if
the screen resolution is 800x600. The wm is xfce-4.0.6.

   How can I determine at what resolution the screen is running and how can I
specify smaller text in application windows? OK, then. That's two naive
questions, not one.

   So many things on this new system are much different from how they
appeared on the RH 7.3 box displaying on a 19" CRT monitor. I want smaller
menus, smaller text and more of it. At least mozilla lets me adjust the text
display size.

Thanks,

Rich

Elliott,

   Thank you. I just ran this and I'll see if it makes a difference.

   Nothing writes across the virtual terminals in X, but I can hear the beep
every time a new message arrives in my inbox. I'll let you know how this
works when I kill X.

Sure - it's called getting your own ASN and running BGP with two (or

Unless your monitor is fuzzy, it's rather apparently by sight.  Maybe
just get close in and squint at some non-aliased text, as in a menubar. 
Here's a neat trick, though:  hold <ctrl> and <alt> and press the + and
- keys on your numerical keypad.  That should cycle through all your
defined screen rez' modes.

Only if you're running the latest X (I heard they actually made it 
work.. never seen it though).
Otherwise, it just "zooms" in and looks really really crappy.

Charlie,

   Using ctrl-alt-+ and ctrl-alt-- has worked for years. But, it doesn't tell
me if I'm actually at the highest resolution.

   The problem is not screen resolution, per se, but the huge size of
application window borders. The menu bar and other decorations are very
broad, much more so than on other monitors I've used. Also, when I invoke
the xfce settings the dialog boxes are very large, too.

   Too many little things with which I'd rather not have to deal right now.

Thanks,

Rich

To find out what your screen resolution is, type 'xwininfo'.  The cursor
will turn into a crosshair.  Click it on the root window.  (You can also
click it on a normal window to find out its geometry, etc.)

If your resolution is wrong, then you might want to look at the X log file
to see what went wrong.  On my (fedora) system that's at /var/log/Xorg.0.log.
If you're using xf86 then the name is obviously going to be different.

Ali,

   Aha! I checked the mozilla window and this is what I get for geometry:
                             -geometry 934x656+0+0
No wonder it looks so big! It _is_ big.

   I am running Xorg. According to the log,

(II) VESA(0): Not using built-in mode "1280x1024" (width too large for
virtual size)

   So that appears to be the problem. What can I do about it?

   Also, at the beginning of the log file the X server removed a bunch of
font directories from the path. Those directories _do_ exist so I'd sure
like to understand why the server thought they should be removed. Could this
have been the result of my adding the paths manually to
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts?

Many thanks for the pointers,

Rich

   Let me add this information to the mx: the resolution of the LyX window is
986x671, but the resolution of the root window is 1024x768.

   Who's the X-pert here? Alan? Help, please!

Subject: [PLUG] Solved: mail overwriting console
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0409092016030.30780@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   With apologies to Charlie, biff was the culprit. However, turning it off
on the console did nothing; it took turning it off in /etc/profile to stop
the overwriting.

   I am still getting a speaker beep on incoming mail (but the console is
left alone, at least). I hope that's equally easy to fix.

   I guess that biff was set to 'n' by default in Red Hat. I had not run pine
in my Slackware boxes, but would ssh to the Red Hat server and run pine on
that.

   What a lesson!

Thanks, all,

Rich

   The same guru who directed me to change biff to 'n' in /etc/profile told
me to comment out comsat in /etc/inetd.conf, too. Yes, it's supposed to be
called only when biff = y, but commenting it out silenced the incoming mail
beep. Another key difference in defaults between Red Hat and Slackware.

   Excelsior! X Window System problems next on the list.

Non-standard resolutions are a pain under X.  

I just set up a system with 1920x1200.

Unless you added specific mode lines, you are probably getting 800x600 or 
worse.

Check the xfree86 log in /var/log and see what is getting set up.

Alan,

   The maximum resolution of this Hyundai L70S monitor is 1280x1024. It
should run at that, and it did when I first set up a machine with
Slackware-9.1 (a couple of months ago at one of the clinics.)

   Last night it occurred to me that the problem may be related to the X
server version. Slackware-9.1 uses XFree86-4.3.0 while Slackware-10.0 uses
6.7.0 from X.org. I recall searching the Web to learn why the switch and it
has to do with licensing, as I recall.

   Anyway, with the other hard drives (the ones with Slackware-9.1 on 'em)
the display on this monitor is 1280x1024 with very clear characters on both
the console and in X. Also, the virtual terminal invocation options work
properly. That is '-fg white -bg black' does produce the expected
appearance. Now, I need to reverse those to have white text on a black
background (my preference).

   According to X.org.log, 1280x1024 is not supported. xwininfo indicates
that the root window is 1024x768, but those applications that open in their
own windows (not in a virtual terminal) are approximately 900x700 dpi
resolution, according to xwininfo. I can send a copy of the log file if that
helps.

   I did not set specific mode lines; I've never learned how to properly do
so.

   The display is not easy on the eyes, consistent or attractive. What are
your recommendations for how I should proceed to work toward resolving this
situation?

Many thanks,

Rich

If this problem cropped up in the change from xfree86 to xorg, you might
have to rename/restore/do something to your X config file.  xorg looks for
a file called xorg.conf in many directories (starting with /etc/X11).  If
it can't any it anywhere it will use the /etc/X11/XF86config left over from
xfree86.  So you might be using a new xorg config file without realizing it.
Try copying /etc/X11/XF86config to /etc/X11/xorg.conf (maybe save the 
original xorg.conf first) and restart X to see what happens.

Ali,

   I took the values for the video card and monitor from the old XF86config.
There are only xorg.conf files in /etc/X11.

And practically speaking, you need a class C (that's 254 addresses)
netblock to get anyone to route to it.  But it does give your server a
redundant connection to the net.

Cheaper way is to have your server bind to addresses on both
connections, and put both addresses in the DNS A record for the server.
Not perfect, but if a connection goes down, half the folks could get to
you.

Maybe dumb question, but why can't you get a /30?  I used to have one so
that I could use  a single static ip for my DSL connection before I
upgraded to a /28, gives me five usable ips.  I know using a netblock is
an expensive solution, but I've talked to my ISP finding that it is
unwilling to stripe two DSL connections together.  I know this person
was concerned that using a different ip at different times with a
particular site could break shopping carts, etc.

Why is there a limit for the size of subnet that an ISP will BGP?
It's hard to believe with such a limited pool of ip addresses that
even businesses across the board need a whole class C to implement
this kind of solution.  Sites that connect your ip to you make using
two ip addresses break things.

Message-ID: <20040910163051.GA22866@gate.kl-ic.com>

This is not directly Linux related, but the right people to discuss
this are on this list.

I am currently passing out business cards, signing emails, etc. with
"keithl at ieee.org" .  I am a long-time member of IEEE, and they have
an email alias system that forwards email sent to  keithl at ieee.org 
to an address I specify.  I can change the forward address from a
webpage form, though it takes about 12 hours for changes to propagate. 
This has been convenient.  IEEE also does some spam filtering, and
when a virus storm hits, they have knocked out as many as 100 virus
emails per hour.

Lately, however, IEEE has been delaying my legitimate mail by as
much as 9 hours, and may be dropping some in the bit bucket.  When
the mail is passed through IEEE, I cannot use a simple graylisting
system.  And of course challenge-response systems don't work;  I
cannot send from my reply-to address, and this makes some transactions
difficult. 

I am considering changing my business cards and reply-tos to connect
to keithl at keithl.com  (which is active now) .  I have the registration
and DNS for my domains set up through dyndns.org (which in turn uses
tucows opensrs), so I can re-point the names to a different IP address
in minutes.  Right now, the addresses terminate at my virtual colo
machine, and mail is routed up a VPN pipe to my internal mail server.
Lots of bandwidth in all the links;  I can easily handle the traffic
of a virus storm, perhaps better than the aggregate the IEEE would see.  

Dyndns.org might dry up and blow away.  On the other hand, IEEE might
decide to terminate the alias program, or screw it up, or change their
policies to make membership unacceptable.  The risks are similar,
though I'm pretty sure a dyndns business failure would result in new
solutions appearing in hours or days.

So it seems that changing my suggested address to  keithl at keithl.com
(leaving keithl at ieee.org active but depreciated) is a win.  Can anyone
here suggest a credible downside?

OK, I'm out of easy answers.  Could you post the Monitor and Screen sections
from your xorg.conf?  And maybe the make and model of your monitor.  Are you 
using the same graphics card as before?  Are there any differences in the
old and new Device sections?  You could even attach your Xorg.0.log file
in case someone has time to wade through it.

Routing tables.  A backbone router has to have an entry for *every*
routable netblock on the Internet.  It was decided that a /24 was the
smallest netblock that'd be advertised, because if they went any
smaller, there'd be too many netblocks in the full Internet routing
table, and routers wouldn't be able to keep up.  

You might think that with faster processors, the routable netblock size
could go down, but network speed and advanced routing protocols are
eating up all the processor power they can.

I've thought of working up a redundant routing thingy using a hosted
Linux box on one end, but (a) there's still a single point of failure
and (b) it's easier to just use the hosted box for the reliable stuff.

I charge extra for "credible".  ;-) 

You might consider a different username portion of the address for
your business card.  That'll give you a little tracking information
about where the addresses are coming from.  E.g.: <info at keithl.com> or
suitable substitutes for "info" other than "keithl".  Eventually, when
you become a multinational conglomerate, you can hire someone to
screen the mail to that address for you! ;-)

Check to make sure that your monitor definition is correct for your

Send me a copy of your xorg.conf file off-line and I will take a look at 
it.

What BGP daemon do you use that keeps the routes in a MySQL database?
Or is this home-brewed?

I'd only suggest that you get a secondary mail server with a static address.
If dyndns quits functioning your mail can still either reach your or be queued
for a few days at the secondary.

mikeraz at patch.com has been a valid email address for over 10 years. I think 
it's a great thing for competent and interested people to register their own

Very home-brewed, and more for my learning experience for now than
actually being useful.

I have a perl script that builds a list of all of our bgp routers by
looking through our Rancid (http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/) configs
for /^router bgp/, then uses "clogin" from the rancid package to do a
"show ip bgp sum" on all of them (I could have used Net::Telnet::Cisco
instead, but was lazy). It then sticks the timestamp, neighbor ip, and
number of prefixes into a mysql database, one table for each of our bgp
routers.

I'm now working on presenting the data in html using apache-perl,
Apache::DBI, and HTML::Mason.

As I said, it's more a learning experience for me than anything else,
but I do hope to build up a suite of reasonably useful tools for our
network engineering group based around perl, mysql, and HTML::Mason.

My inspiration came from this presentation about extending the use of
Rancid and other tools: http://www.nanog.org/mtg-0210/abley.html

I've turned them both off because of high false

I think it's foolish to use these lists to block mail. The sites
on these lists violate the RFCs for a good reason (to them).

It would be similar to someone maintaining a black list
of all sites that _require_ MX records when the ancient RFCs
state that A records should be used.

Next we'll have black lists for "top posters", people who ask
for help before doing exhaustive Googling, and Republicans.

Not comparable.  It's reasonable to expect someone to comply with the
RFCs, but not have MX records when the MX and A would point to the
same host.

It is absolutely comparable. In both cases, the RFCs are being violated.
Should we blacklist any site that violates any of the RFCs? It seems like
you're saying yes, we should.

If so, we may as well blacklist all sites running Windows. Windows
violates a number of RFCs.

At work we're going to start using a USB based PIC as a protocol
translator.  We have a lot of software that talks to a similar translator
over the serial port, and I was wondering if there was a way to tell Linux
(RH/Fedora) to map the device as another serial port.  It is Universal

Any ideas on if and/or how?

Is this really a google issue?  I thought it was more 
of a common practice issue.  I wasn't interested in
political commentary.  What guidelines are there if
the RFC's are the guidelines and they aren't followed?

Has anyone used black lists in more of a weighted scheme
where the result of earlier testing affects the outcome
in Postfix?  If SPF passes, I figure on skipping the
abuse and postmaster checks.  The other option I'm 
curious about is putting email on hold instead of 
dropping it.

   Alan pointed me in the proper direction. I opened the case and learned
that the video card is an ATI Rage 128 Pro Ultra with 32M SDRam. Checking
the linux hardware compatibility HOWTO I found the proper driver for this
chip set is the r128.

   Set this all up in /etc/xorg.conf re-started X and it all works as
promised: 1280x1024, and that's what xwininfo (thank you, Ali!) tells me.
Whew!

   Now, ... VMware is the next major application to get running (with the
latest Samba, of course).

   Then, sound (just for giggles, of course). At least I now have the entire
Red Hat 7.3 backup restored on a 40G partition so I can pick at it as needed
and I don't have to worry about keeping a tape with everything.

   You folks are certainly outstanding. I only hope that my attempts at
offering help partially offsets all the help I get from all of you.

Thanks,

Rich

AFAIK, no, such a thing is not possible with Postfix today.

The RFCs - unless I read your question incorrectly.

Look, the issue is whether we should punish Internet sites for
not following RFCs to the letter. The majority of sites that are
in the rfc-ignorant list are there because they're deliberately trying
to protect their site or they're trying to make it more difficult for
the bad guys - not because they're ignorant of the RFCs.

Perhaps a simpler analogy is in order. There are RFCs that describe
the operation of the ICMP protocol. One of the functions of ICMP
is to echo packets. Most of us have done this with ping programs.

If I choose to block ICMP ping packets at my firewall because there
have been attacks that exploited ICMP, am I violating an RFC?
A strict interpretation says yes. Do I deserve to be placed on a
black list because I'm trying to protect my site?

Another related example: Windows computers, by default, don't
respond to broadcasts pings. You may interpret this as violating at
least one of the RFCs, but we should all be happy that Microsoft
designed Windows that way.

I think Spamassassin may do something like that.  Certainly, its scoring

I just let SA mark it as spam and then have Procmail direct it to
another folder.  I check it every few weeks for false-positives (only
saw one when I had SA misconfigured) and dump it.

Eh, sorta.  A USB device will tell its host what sort of device it is,
and then speak a protocol appropriate for that device.  If the PIC
identifies itself as an RS232 port and acts like one, Linux will map it
to a serial port.  All depends on what HID descriptor and interface code
you download into the PIC.

Check this article for details on a PIC that looks like a USB mouse:

Google also spotted a PIC USB microphone.  Dang, now *I* want to play
with the stuff.

How does not supporting postmaster or abuse protect your mail site?
Are the majority of mail sites ignoring the RFC's now on postmaster
and abuse?  Considering the helo name, why does Postfix have tests to
make sure this is a valid and fully qualified domain name?  Is there 
any widely adopted standard for what the string should be in a helo? 
Postfixs' helo tests expect a valid hostname, I don't know if SPF 
checks look at the helo at all.

I slipped a gear when I wrote the portion of my message that you quoted 
above.
I was commenting of the bogusmx rfc-ignorant black list when I wrote that,
because it was an issue here recently. However, I still say that 
rejecting mail
based on the abuse black list is a mistake.

I've done that, too.  Works well.  I've also tried the RPM package for
Fedora.  I noticed that it puts the main files in /usr/lib/firefix-0.9.3
but it also puts a firefox executable in /usr/bin

Message-ID: <BAY9-F30UghLpx3VTMv0000d962@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

I have a realmedia file that I want to play on my linux box.  (Fedora RC2, 
kernel 2.6.6).
I have Mplayer with realmedia codecs but the file just shows up with
blurry lines.  I know the same file played fine with RealPlayer on Windows.
So I went to Real.com and downloaded both the Helix Player as well
as RealPlayer 10.  Helix Player won't recognize the realmedia file and ask
me to download RealPlayer.  I got Realplayer 10 to install
but when I typed "realplay", nothing shows up.  I did an 'strace' and it
stops at wait(-1.....).  I guess it is waiting for something....

Is it my kernel that Realplayer does not like?  Any tip on how to
get RealPlayer to work? Thanks

Subject: [PLUG] Trouble building Linux answering machine...
Message-ID: <1095019273.26350.50.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

This method of telephony requires the caller to have different
equipment.  It's not an answering technology.  Lots of places
googling around are recommending to consumers that they attempt 
VoIP by setting up two 56k modems.  One for you and the other 
for the party you are calling.  I don't see how 56k is fast 
enough for VoIP.  I tried googling on vgetty modem, I didn't
get very far.

I want a vgetty compatible modem.  These are amazingly hard to
find.  On Ebay, there are few externals modems left where they
are getting very pricey.  My dream is to build a Linux server
with answer capability that also has a wireless network on it
so that you check messages anywhere in your house assuming you 
have a laptop with wireless capability.

It seems if you really want a Linux compatible voice modem that 
you just have to design and build it yourself.  I'm appaled at 
the lack of Linux compatible USB voice modems searching on 
http://linux-usb.org.  I think I saw a total of one, a US Robotics
model.  A person left a comment that it likes to stop working 
randomly.  Googled into a guy who says he has done BBS'es that 
doesn't like US Robotics modems.  He claims the cases they are 
in neither stack nor cool well.  I see no reason why a clever
person couldn't take one out of it's plastic case to use it.
His comment about them only being designed for two hours of
use at a time though, that's a more intractable problem.

Anyone know where a list of voice capable winmodems that work 
under Linux is?  Of all the winmodems, many HCF ones with voice
capabilities are supported by Linuxant drivers.  Externals on 
E-Bay are hovering around $50+.

I would like to see full featured V.92 modems with data/fax/voice
capability that work with Linux fully in both pci and USB form
factors.  There just isn't a product out there right now that
really works well.  This is too bad.  Many people have a single
phone line and a buddy.  A cable Internet service outage might 
make being able to place a data call to a buddy handy.  In the 
interest of buying the fewest possible modems, fully featured 
modems make the most sense.  Why buy one modem for voice and 
another one for data if you only have one phone line?

My Intel536ep voice features work under Windows, but I intended
a combination answering machine with wireless distribution of
the messages on a Linux box.  Short of figuring out how to write 
message distribution software for Windows that works with the 
Windows voice package, I'm toast.  Nobody wants to go in the 
room where I have the machine set up to check for messages.  I'm 
getting a lot of complaints from people about not knowing there 
are messages for them.  I'm also getting complaints about not 
having the message checking feature available at the most 
popular phone in the house.  Since I can't build a Linux 
answering machine instead of a Windows one, these issues 
are awfully hard to address.

   Strange, strange behavior by the firefox-installer. Anywho, I found a Web
page on which someone reported the same installation problem, but with
Mandrake-9. One of the responders said that he, too, had this problem and he
solved it by grabbing the non-installer version from mozilla's Web site.

   Did that. Moved it all to /usr/local/firefox. Lit the fuse and off it
went. Works well.

   Thank you all for your thoughtful comments and puzzled expresssions why I
had problems when you didn't. At least this is fixed. Opera still won't
load, but that's for another day.

   I installed opera-7.54-static-qt in /usr/loca/bin/. When I try to invoke

Qwest offers voice-mail for about $3 a month. You can access it from any phone,
anywhere, any time.

Youre not going to find what youre looking for, and you dont seem to want to
create a solution yourself, so might as well look at other solutions, such as
an answering machine, with a cordless phone, or get voice-mail from your phone
provider.

Not a quest customer nor am I going to become one.  CenturyTel screwed
up the bill to the tune of $400 extra in a single month for phone
charges from MCI.  Not being an MCI customer, they said the charges 
would be removed.  The last thing I am interested in is more services
from this phone company beyond the ones I already have.  This isn't a
basic service and I very much doubt that they'd only charge $3/month 
for it.   At a lot of places, you pay $10/month.

I'm not the kind of person who is knowledgable in how to design and
build my own modem.  Maybe my brother who's an EE could do the circuit
design necessary and actually implement one, but I haven't got any
circuits background myself.  If I knew which winmodem to get and paid
around $20 for it,  I'd do better than quest's $3/month in 6 to 8 months
of recording messages on my own machine.  Even if given the right 
winmodem I have to pay Linuxant $15 for a licensed linux driver,
that's still only a year to cover the investment.  I strongly discourage
using your phone company's voicemail feature.  I had a friend with
voicemail in Toledo.  It was awful.  You couldn't hear the messages and
it cost at least $10/month.  It almost cost as much as the line itself.

Bringing messages into your computer offers archival advantages.
You can burn important messages to CD-R when they have long term value.
Doing your own messaging service, you can also have backup copies
in case one gets deleted before it's listened to or in case you want
a record.  With a DTMF tone capable modem, you can support multiple
voice mail boxes.  If it's $3/month for a single voicemail box, that
becomes significant if you want voicemail for enough people.  Pay
for four voice mailboxes and you up to the price of another 
phone line.

One thing I have found googling is that Linux has been embedded in
an answering machine by an Italian telecommunications company.  
It's only in America it seems that you can't find a Linux based
telephone voicemail/fax appliance.

So, when you google for: 

Linux answering machine

What about the modems they recommend?

Subject: [PLUG] OSS Rundown
Message-ID: <20040912182006.058cbc50.jason@vancleve.com>

Below is a brief appraisal of OSS, which I've just written.  It's
completely redundant, just sort of an in-my-own-words type exercise. 
But if you should decide to peruse it, feel free to comment or quote it
according to your own caprice.

--Jason Van Cleve


Untitled:

>From my reading, there seem to be two basic arguments in favor of Open
Source Software, one economical and the other idealogical, and both of
which apply to enterprise application development.  To my own mind,
moreover, the idealogical argument is by far the stronger of the two. 
In fact there is a third argument, that of security, which relates to
the economical one:  but so far, this is rather speculative and
inconclusive, so that it remains to be seen which model results in more
secure software.  (As to that, however, Microsoft have shown practically
that they are not able to fix security defects in a timely manner,
whereas open-source products have shown remarkable agility in doing so.)

The open-source economist posits that there is only one advantage to
closed-source (or "proprietary") software, the ability to capitalize on
innovations through the use of Intellectual Property rights and trade
secrets.  But, he asserts, the financial benefits of OSS--including
improvements to the products from outside parties and the general
sharing of knowledge--far outweigh this marginal benefit (unless,
perhaps, it is abused to the point of anti-competitiveness, which is not
uncommon).  By allowing the world to examine their source code,
companies can expect the lavish rewards of other interested parties
offering their input and enhancements, the result of which is a richer,
more robust system.  I find this hard to accept as an axiom.  Certainly
there are such cases, but they rely on the popularity of the
software--particularly among developers.  If there are too few outside
parties actually willing to improve a given vendor's code, or if that
code is of obviously poor quality, then the vendor may do better to
conceal its innovations (or sloppy craftsmanship) and rely more on
marketing.

(Other aspects of the economic argument pertain not to the development
of OSS but to its use.  If using open-source applications is indeed
cost-effective, which I believe it is, then software vendors should be
motivated to develop such.  But that is outside the scope of this brief
essay.)

Now, the idealogical argument is summarized by the simple aphorism,
"knowledge wants to be free".  This demands that software vendors quit
thinking of their designs and innovations as property.  It suggests that
these things are not products at all, that software is in fact
knowledge--knowledge that ought to be available to all, just as the
facts and methods of other sciences are.  This is a real paradigm shift
from the current status quo, but its potential for benefiting the whole
of technology--and hence mankind at large--is tremendous, even if it
bodes poorly for certain software firms.  Thus, as pertaining to
enterprise development, it is an issue of social responsibility.

In the first place, Open Source software has been shown to promote
standards and interoperability.  This in turn allows users to choose the
proverbial "best of breed" for any particular software task, and that
freedom of choice means real competition among software developers,
products that compete on their merits and not by leveraging an
established user base.  Secondly, OSS promotes real innovation:  when
existing designs can be scrutinized, they can be improved upon, and they
often give rise to new and better designs.

All of which amounts to an improved state of the art; and ultimately,
that will benefit everyone.

However, it must be realized that although knowledge wants to be free,
it is not inherently so.  It is an arbitrary choice that we must all
make.  Existing software vendors will be slow to embrace it, because it
requires fundamental changes to their business models.  They must learn
to make money not by selling copies of their software but by selling its
support and maintenance instead:  and they must do it for the sake of
all of us.  In a capitalist economy, that can be a hard sell.

   I'm ready to donate one of my redundant systems (as soon as Rob surfaces

So I booted with Tom's Root Boot, ran fdisk on both, and deleted all
partitions.

   Which makes me wonder: if the data on the drive was originally in ext3
filesystems, and the partition table has been cleared, are data still
recoverable with sophisticated tools and sufficient skill?

Just curious,

Yes.  At the very least, zero out the disk by running 'dd if=/dev/zero
of=/dev/hda'.  Or maybe use /dev/urandom for input instead of /dev/zero.
It's still recoverable by government-grade equipment, but I hope you
don't need that.  If you do, a very long extension cord and a thrift-
store microwave oven might be the way to go.

   Thanks, Cooper. I'll look at that sfdisk. I suspect, however, that if the
partition table is empty it would not be able to restore it unless there was
an image on the boot cdrom.

Wil,

   Well, ... despite the official paranoia in DC, there's nothing of vital
importance on those disks.

   If I wanted to _really_ clean them up I'd disassemble the drive and use a
bulk eraser on the disks. :-)

He's telling the truth: you can take my word for
it--at least up to 1.5 Mb. Unless I overlooked
something, no MD5SUMs were provided, although I think
it's okay.

Air?  How about sleep?  :-)

You're on my list of people I need to send emails to before I sleep
tonight.

IMHO, a dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hda (and hdb if you have a second
disk) is enough to keep most prying eyes from the data.  But as was said
before, if you want to keep the data out of the hands of the feds,
destruction is your only route.  I'd suggest, personally, the above,
followed by opening the drives and scrubbing the platters with steel
wool, microwaving them, then utilizing the platters as gun targets.

Modems with voice capability were *very* common for a few years,
but I guess the market for them just didn't hold up.

I have an old Zoom 56K Dualmode external which I've been using for
several years with vgetty. I has the Rockwell chipset, very common
in voice-capable modems.

Since they were so common for a while I would suggest looking anywhere
that has used computer equipment. You don't need a very high bitrate
for just an answering machine, so even an old 14K modem with voice
capability would work fine. It might cost you all of $3 assuming you
can find it. Even if the first one you find doesn't work you can make
a lot of mistakes at $3 a pop.

With a dead partition table `sfdisk` won't be able to recover things, but
recovery would still be trivial. Doing `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hd?` will
make things impossible for low-budget attackers, and hard for large
budget (>$100K) attackers.

There is a free utility called Darik's Boot and Nuke which is perfect
for your situation. It loads onto a floppy and I think you can just
press enter, and it makes all data irrecoverable. Have fun!

I'd add two other arguments:

* OSS typically provides greater flexibility, since you get to

   Thanks, Elliott. I've nothing of such sensitivity that it requires
paranoid erasure steps, but I will take everyone's advice and write zeros
(or random bits) across the platters.

   Similarly, for the past decade-and-a-half I've used my venerable Bostich
1/4" shredder for anything with my name and an account number on it before
it goes to the recyling barrel. I could spend more money and get a cross-cut
shredder that makes 1/8" squares of the paper, but I doubt that anyone would
find what I shred to be worth the effort of separating 1/4" strips, putting
them together in order and reading what's there. Holding up convenience
stores is much less work.

A winmodem specifically? Or was the requirement simply for an

I have SquirrelMail 1.4.3a-1 on a Fedorda Core 2 system.  I can logon 
and see my messages just fine but I have two problems. 

1) On the left hand side I can only see the Inbox and no other boxes. 

2) I can't create any folders either.  I know this is more than likely a 
permisison problem but I'm not sure which directory the permissions 
should be set in and what they should be set to.

Any and all help is appreciated.

Thank You

If you're still using Cyrus IMAPd, You might try running
/usr/share/squirrelmail/config/conf.pl and selecting "D" to "set
predefined settings for specific IMAP servers." Enter cyrus. This sets
the correct folder prefix, etc.

If you're using UW imapd, then you'll want to create a ~/.mailboxlist 
file that lists your folders. It's a simple operation if you've got 
traditional-style mailboxes:

   # assuming your mail folders are in ~/mail, then
   cd
   find mail -type f > .mailboxlist

Oops, sorry guys, I forgot to mention that I should have specified that

Also after using Dan's suggestion I can create folder under the Inbox 
folder but that is the only way.

Nope. Traditional mailboxes are plain files, and the .mailboxlist 
catalog is merely a listing of those files. UW imapd can't read 
messages from directories, only from mail folders.

Now that I think about it, however, I'd probably suggest adding sort 
into that toolchain:

   # if you want traditional ascii sort order
   find mail -type f | env LC_COLLATE=C sort > .mailboxlist

   # alternatively, if you want a locale-specific order
   find mail -type f | env LC_COLLATE=en_US sort > .mailboxlist

This latter argument is what the OSDL guy (the guy who hired Linus and
gave the talk, er a while back) called a "control point" analogous to
"price point".  In other words, some people need control over their
software to be able to solve their problem and no practical cost or
convenience factor can compensate for a lack of control.

Free Software gives you control.  Of course it can also be, and often
is, cheaper and (all things considered) more convenient as well.

That's a nicer phrasing that I had. "Control point" it is! :-)

Subject: [PLUG] USB Mass Storage errors
Message-ID: <86llfegeou.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I've got a 200 Gig IDE drive in an external enclosure, used as a
backup device.  I am getting occasional lockups during particularly
intense rsyncs, and just had my first on 2.6.8.1 last night.
Afterwards, I began getting messages like:

   scsi4: ERROR on channel 0, id 0, lun 0, CDB: Read (10) 00 00 00 6a 8a 00 00 04 00
   Current sdb: sense key Medium Error
   Additional sense: Unrecovered read error
   end_request: I/O error on device sdb1, logical block 27273

and on and on for different blocks.  I vaguely recall hearing about
IDE devices that could screw up the checksums on sectors if shut down
abruptly, and subsequently assign read errors to them as a result.  Is
that a likely scenario here, and if so is there anything I can do
about it, like a reformat.  The smartutils stuff doesn't (or didn't
when I tried a while ago) seem to work across the USB-to-IDE bridge,
but I'd be willing to jack the thing directly into an IDE port if I
can fix it.

The disk is, from what I can tell from the logs:

  scsi4 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices

I don't have a solution, but I experienced the same thing with a
USB-to-IDE bridge used for backups.  I ended up taking it back and
assumed it was the USB-to-IDE bridge that was at fault.  Then I just
attached an internal drive and haven't tried to do the USB connection
since.

I've been doing this for almost a year now, with largely the same 
hardware (just replaced the disks a couple months ago, but the 
enclosures and the host's USB2 interface are the same as ever).  I 
haven't seen this particular problem before.

It looks like Maxtor has a diagnostic utility for their HDs: PowerMax. 
I guess I should try that.

Of course, the Devil's Advocate would also say you could translate
these into euphemisms for "very difficult to use and setup and no one
will give you a simple, straightforward answer that reduces TCO in the
long run". <joke>I know I enjoy watching The Saga of Rich.</joke> :-)

This is, of course, moot in the face of control issues, as described.

At the last PLUG presentation, I mentioned that there is a lot working
happening behind the scenes to make the Linux desktop suck less. The
K12LTSP project does a fine job highlighting many of these suckages ;-)

Today Havoc Pennington posted a paper on "stateless Linux" that
hopes to address many of the issues I've experienced. Fun stuff!

This is a known error, and as we speak Elliott Mitchell is hunting through
kernel and driver code for a solution.  Please help him achieve fame and
fortune (and perhaps impress future employers) by sending him logs.  Also,
please see which USB to IDE chipset is in the bridge in your external
enclosure.  This may show up in /proc/bus/usb/devices , or in dmesg .

Note that some of the older enclosures may be incapable of doing >137GB
drives.  This is a separate issue, and perhaps not solvable with kernel
code repairs, depending on the way the enclosure constructs ATA commands.  

This is a fairly critical problem to solve, because IDE hotswap is being
left out of the 2.6 kernel, perhaps indefinitely, according to Alan Cox.
USB2 or ethernet are the only hotswap alternatives for 2.6 I know of. 
In the interim, do NOT use a USB drive for backups.

Keith

I do apologize if you find this offensive. It's just that since I
joined the mailing list, what, a year ago, I could swear I've seen
some question or another from you at least 1-3 times a week. And
they're not stupid questions, either. Is there a dark cloud over your
house? :-)

Thanks for responding. I'm really hoping to hook up with some people who

At the bottom of the algorithms are some processor-specific assembly
language code that I'm specifically interested in.

Message-ID: <41463D8B.4060003@loowit.net>

Hi PLUG folk,

My employer (Wind River) has a few openings for experienced Senior 
Software Engineer or Member of Technical Staff level. The candidate will 
be experienced with Linux inside and out, and also have several year's  
skill and experience in the embedded (multiple CPU architectures) or 
telecommunications software specialities. Also useful skills are 
build/packaging and distribution of Linux systems (think Linux from 
Scratch or the like), cross-development toolchains (compilers, loaders), 
bootloaders, debugger technologies (think networked debug ala kgdb) and 
Linux systems quality assurance (including bug tracking, test systems 
design and planning).

We're looking now for highly experienced people. Once those people have 
been able to chew on the project for a while we may open up hiring for 
folks that might only have experience in one of the above areas -- and 
when that happens I'll send out another notice.

For just the right person, employment in Beaverton is possible, with 
more options in Alameda, California. We are not able to consider 
contract positions for this at this time, only full-time regular 
salaried employment.

If you're interested send a resume and cover sheet to 
wendy.clappis at windriver.com, or if you'd rather have an informal chat 
with me, drop me the information and we'll arrange a time.

Cheers,
James Perkins

It goes into spam and critiques some of the methods of MTA level filtering

I almost wonder if I should just go ahead and use the postmaster, abuse,
and whois black lists 450'ing instead of 5xx'ing messages that are from
sources on those lists? 

One thing I don't know much about is using regular expression
checks in postfix.  I've noticed a lot of spam has -ms- somewhere
in the helo.  If I do a test that checks when -ms- is in the
helo and the helo doesn't match the connected from ip,
that'd block a tremendous amount of junk. 

One thing that bothers me, I've noticed that Microsoft sites behind nat 
will
give their hostname even though the connected from  ip on my end doesn't
match that name.  At least I'm trying to relay through a dummy relay so 
that
the helo looks right.  Can postfix be configured to be masquerading
aware removing the need for a dummy?  For example,
if your going through gateway foo, why not give a helo of  foo? 
Extending this, if you're going through boo why not give a helo
of  boo?  It seems that any MTA should be able to pretend to
be the name of a gateway doing network address translation 
for it.

I'm concerned long term about which filtering methods at the MTA level are
going to be usable and learning how to use them affectively.  I use 
postfix-2.1.1
right now, I don't know if that's still current.

Perry Wagle will be speaking on the programming construct known as
"Continuations".  This is a subject usually covered over the course of a
quarter in an Advanced programming course at OGI, but Perry will be

Uh, not according to Maxtor.  They say that the drive is failing.  I
am getting a warranty exchange.  Although, it depends on the which
definition of this this is.

If there is a bug causing the lockups, that wouldn't surprise me.
Indeed I assume that is the case.  If there is a kernel bug that is
causing the sector read errors, then it is doing an excellent job of
channeling through to other, less worthy, operating systems where the
Maxtor diagnostic software runs (DR DOS, actually). ;-)

I have 3-4 different USB drive enclosures that I can make available, if 
that would help the effort. All support drives > 137 G.

Is this only a USB problem, or also firewire?

   While folks like Chris amuse themselves at my travails (which does not
bother me), I need to point out the health benefits of OSS that far exceed
anything offered by proprietary software, particularly of the operating
system varieties that are propagated by a certain monopoly in Redmond, WA.

   If you've paid attention to the recent research and news reports about
senile dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease you are aware that a
consistent thread is seen in these reports. Continuing mental challenge and
use of the brain reduces the likelihood of acquiring this debilitating
condition. (Those of you with relatives who have Alzheimer's know just how
debilitating it is.)

   Having a hard drive fail and needing to assemble new hardware into a
working system with a new (and current) distribution, then restore all prior
data and mission-critical applications provides that high degree of mental
challenge and synaptic activity that keeps us in touch with the real world.
That other OS has all the mental stimulation of watching sit-coms (I guess
they're called "reality shows" nowadays) on T.V.

   So, in addition to documented lower TCO, greater flexibility and choice so
that the software works as you do rather than the other way around, add
mental health benefits and long-term protection against senile dementia in
your sales pitch. I suspect, however, that this pitch would not resonate
with too many entrenched IT big-wigs because they are already mentally
limited to thinking that proprietary software solutions are the only way to
go.

   Join me in ehnancing mental health: use OSS!

   Sigh. Here's another new one. I'm using aterm rather than rxvt or xterm
because 1) they allow pseudo-transparency (and darkening the shade of the
background for better contrast and visibility) and 2) they use fewer
resources than do xterms. (aterm is an authorized derivative forked from
rxvt.)

   What I notice when I use a pager (less) to view a text file is that
whatever prior file I viewed shows up in the virtual terminal above (i.e.,
toward the top of the window) the file I want to view. This is quite
distracting. Has anyone encountered this before?

   It's not that I don't have enough to fix here, but all these little things
keep appearing. Just like Topsie.

Very good.  Enticing.  We put a SMTP spool in place to take the load off
the (eh ... Windows systems -- not Exchange though) and the CPU load
dropped about 50%.  Then a few simple anti-UCE configurations and down 
again -- a bit.  We do have two C-Class ranges blocked with iptables which 
brings my question.  Is the BSD pf similar to ip ( filter|tables )?

I can already smell the counter-FUD:

"Here at Microsoft, we care about your mental health.  That's why we
maintain such byzantine licensing policies... they're an important
part of your daily anti-aging regimen.  The GPL isn't just a cancer,
it'll give you Alzheimer's too!"

No, the syntax is actually logical and easy to understand.

pf/ipf are far superior, but if you want rate-limiting, you'll need to 
add altq (for pf) or use ipfw (with dummynet) instead.

You can actually run both ipf and ipfw, but that gets quite tricky.

I've seen similar symptoms when your non-interactive login environment 
emits character output beyond the shell prompt. If, for example, the 
window spawned by "xterm +ls" has any non-prompt text, then less will 
have trouble.

Also, you might consider seeing if you or the system has some alias 
for less that might be causing trouble:

   type less

As a final alternative, you might see if your shell environment has 
any of the LESS* variables defined in a funky way, e.g.,

   printenv | grep LESS

I'm sorry. I consider that flamebait. I find netfilter to be perfectly
easy to understand and extremely logical. I just read the pf FAQ on
openbsd.org and I see there are some plusses and minuses to its
syntax, but I'd never call it "far superior".

Now, perhaps you are confusing netfilter with iproute2 (which is
principally used for shaping), for which I will make no apologies.

Paul,

   I explicitly define the command to open a shell from the Xfce panel with
"-sl" so it's a login shell.

   What is this telling us?

   A thought just occurred to me: I have aterm parameters defined in
~/.Xdefaults:

aterm*loginShell:true
aterm*transparent:true
aterm*shading:60
aterm*background:Black
aterm*foreground:White
aterm*scrollBar:true
aterm*scrollBar_right:true
aterm*transpscrollbar:true
aterm*saveLines:32767
aterm*font:*-*-fixed-medium-r-normal--*-140-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1
aterm*boldFont:*-*-fixed-bold-r-normal--*-*-140-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1

   Might these be conflicting with the command line in a negative way?

Many thanks,

Use long prompt by default, and try to send stuff through the
lesspipe.sh script first (which does fancy things like list the
insides of a .zip file).

Frankly, the error you first listed on the mailing list sounded like a
termcap/ncurses issue.

   Thanks, Chris. I'll have to read more when I have some time. I never
examined the guts of less, just used it. Guess it's time for some
exploratory surgery.

   May well be. Any diagnostic tests I can run that would help clarify the
issue?

Just my opinion... speaking strictly about syntax.

I'd say you can't "Just Look" at a netfilter rule and know what it does.
"-j? -m? -A? -i? What's all that do?"
Its just not as straightforward, IMHO.

Message-ID: <20040914235003.GA17147@patch.com>

Slashdot rejected the story, so you're subjected.

I thought this was a hoax:

  http://www.bikeforums.net/showthread.php?t=66128&page=1&pp=25

  As you guys might remember, I recently had the nicest set of wheels
  I've ever had stolen from me. Today I was hanging out with a friend
  and we got to talking about that - he said his friend showed him just
  recently how to open a U-Lock with a ball point pen.

  Of course I didn't believe it. That is until just thirty seconds
  ago when I opened my own Kryptonite Evolution 2000 with a bic ball
  point pen!

  This has to be the most absurd thing I've ever seen. Try it. Take the
  end off the pen, jam it in the lock, wiggle around and twist.

Then three friends report that it works.  I'm still looking for a pen of 
the right size for my lock.

Believe it when you see it:
  http://thirdrate.com/misc/krypto.mov

It's a great hardware hack, and bad news for all the bicycle people with 
these common and trusted locks.

   Thanks, Bill.

   When I read /etc/apache/httpd.conf I learned that one can pick just about
anyone and any group. However, for linux the default is nobody.nobody. That
works for me, so I left it at that.

Subject: [PLUG] SQL-Ledger turns over but will not start
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0409141828300.30797@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Hardly had SQL-Ledger been debugged and running on the old system when
that went away. Rather than try to fix everything (UIDs, GIDs, perms, and so
on) from the restore I decided to upgrade SQL-Ledger (to 2.4.2) and postgres
(to 7.4.5). Built and installed postgres, sql-ledger; installed
apache-1.3.31 from the package. Added the sql-ledger directories to
/etc/apache/httpd.conf, added user 'sql-ledger' to postgres.

   However, when I try to connect via firefox-0.9.3 or opera-7.54 to
http://localhost/sql-ledger/admin.pl I get "Error! No Database Drivers
available!". The new sql-ledger.conf is the same as the old sql-ledger.conf.
I cannot find anything in the sql-ledger manual about troubleshooting this
error. In firefox, if I try to open http://localhost I end up on an
apache.org Web page.

   Has anyone an idea what I mis-configured or missed configuring? Quite
perplexing.

Thanks,

Rich

Is there a hole there?  I don't remember what brand mine is (I've had
it for nearly 15 years) but it doesn't have a hole.  I guess mine is
safe from the pen trick.  Besides, my bike is an old assembled junk
pile relic, so it's theft-appeal is fairly low.

My cousin the bike mechanic is building me a new wheel to solve my
sprocket problem, converting from 14-30 6-speed to 11-34 7-speed.
It'll be aluminum rimmed too, replacing the steel rims, so my rear
brakes should also improve.  He is a little slow, but he's now spent
money that he won't recover until completion, so I am a little more
encouraged at potential pace.

I've been busy working and up very late most of this summer, which has
meant that I'm exhausted in the day and haven't had the energy to do
the Burley trailer with the boys over to the grandparents house much.
But today, weather nice, me ready, boys excited, I did.  But still,
I've rolled up a heckuva lot fewer miles this summer than last.  Or it
seems like it.  With some fragments missing because I hadn't connected
the cyclocomputer, my year-to-date total is just 323.73 miles.  Hmm,
actually not as bad as I thought compared to 2003 (full-year: 405.08
miles).  I guess I had a relatively big spring.

Gonna be at the Advanced Topics tomorrow?

Wil,

   So I have been told. I had not needed to explicitly go fetch them before.
Regardless, that's the first thing on my to-do list today -- right after

   Well, I found it and now I'm trying to install it. When I type cpan and
get the prompt I ask it to 'install Pg.pm'. So it goes looking. If I try
'perl ...' I'm told it's not an executable file. I need a HOWTO as a
reference.

   My google searches on how to install DBD::Pg haven't helped. I have the
file PG.pm on the drive here. It contains the source for DBD::Pg. My feeble
efforts with cpan>; e.g., 'install PG.pm' or (with a renamed copy) 'install
DBD::Pb' fail. As an aside, cpan is unable to find the module in its archive
of ftp servers, too.

   BTW, I mis-typed a number the first time I ran MCPAN. What do I erase so
that I can run it anew the next time and make better choices of continents
and countries to search for modules?

TIA,

Rich

This can be changed by editing the CPAN Config.pm file (if memory servers 
me correctly).

The alternative (which I've never done) is to 

	# perl -MCPAN -e shell
	o conf init

Here is the URL that references this; found with a google search but
several wrong choices.

Or rather, for your distribution of linux, the default is nobody:nobody. 

On some distributions, it's apache:apache. Others may use other users.

Subject: [PLUG] Sound card recommendations
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0409151003440.2232-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I started a _little_ project to build a PVR since I had some parts laying 
around.  Well time and circumstance have caused it to grow ... a bit.  
It's now looking more like an entertainment box; video record and 
play-back from two different tuner cards or DVD drive(s), music 
capture (or cd ripping) and play-back, sitting on the home network so 
others can access the files and so forth.  So I figure an above average 
sound card makes sense.

Suggestions, recommendations, etc.

FYIW, this will be running Fedora Core 2 ( obviously the 2.6 kernel ) on
an Athlon 2600+ with 1GByte RAM (two matched 512 DDR w/ 400 FSB) but the
down side is only IDE drives since they are less expensive per GByte.  I
am considering a SATA controller and drives for the data.  Any views or
recommendations on this?


TIA,
Rod

The idea is, if you don't have a job, you can still get some

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0409151124350.29272@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Now that I have DBD::Pg installed I can open the admin Web page just fine.
However, there's one little glitch: no dataset defined within postgres. A
minor point, to be sure, but ... :-)

   According to the SQL-Ledger docs, after telling postgres to add a user
named 'sql-ledger' with permissions to add datasets and other users, I'm to
run the command, 'createlang plpgsql dataset'. Well, there's no 'dataset' to
which to apply the command. See:

postgres at salmo:/home/rshepard$ createlang plpgsql dataset
createlang: could not connect to database dataset: FATAL:  database
"dataset" does not exist

   Now this does work when the dataset is specified as 'template1'. What name
does one give to the 'dataset'? I've not yet created any data{base|set} so
I'm unclear for what postgres is looking.

   Otherwise, I think I'm ready to actually use it.

Thanks,

Rich

   Never mind. I created a dataset with pgsql and discovered the
Administration chapter in the SQL-Ledger manual. I shall read that silently
to myself and leave you all to your lives.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0409160642040.15130@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'm at a loss what to do. I defined me as a user for sql-ledger.
/usr/local/sql-ledger/users and ../members are both owned by nobody.nobody
(the owner of httpd). I can provide the contents of 'members' if that helps.

   However, when I open http://localhost/sql-ledger/login.pl and enter the
username and password I used to create me as a user I see this:

Error!

FATAL: user "rshepard" does not exist

   I spent a lot of time yesterday trying to resolve this paradox (including
sending a message to Dieter last evening). It is frustrating to be stuck in
an infinite loop where the application shows me as the authorized user but
then does not allow me to log in because I'm not an authorized user.

   To add to the pain, when I open the admin.pl page, there I am at the very
top section as a registered user.

   If you have any ideas on this I'd greatly appreciate the help. I cannot
see how to resolve this impasse; perhaps someone more distant from it can.

Thanks,

Rich

SquirrelMail works for me, though others tell me that some of the 
various IMP-based packages are better at handling and processing 
attachments.

Good question, Squirrelmail works good for me too.  I have another 
question while were on the same subject.

Does anyone know of any alternatives to "sqwebmail" that uses Maildir's 
for ISP style webmail?
Particularly something with a better looking GUI and something that can 
be customized?  Non Free is an option too but free would be nice.

Thanks

   Got this fixed. I had not yet set me up as a postgres user (that was far
down the list on the new system), but that was the hangup. When one installs
sql-ledger and creates a user for that name, it does not allow sql-ledger to
create additional postgres users through the sql-ledger interface. It all
must be done from the command line as user postgres.

Subject: [PLUG] Disk space question using LVM
Message-ID: <s1496e8b.014@ohsu.edu>

Hello all:
 
I have recently become the sysadmin for a machine running SuSE Linux
8.1 (i386) using LVM.  The previous sysadmin has a cronjob that checks
for disk space running out and I am trying to figure out how to free up
space on the "/" partition.  Here is the output from df -k:
 
Filesystem    1K-blocks      Used          Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda3     16851664     16356572    495092   98%   /
 
The problem is when I "ls -ls" the "/" directory I see no where near
16GB being used.  
 
Am I missing something obvious?  My apologies if this is
vague/confusing or totally off base.
 
Thanks,
Jon

Try doing `du -sk /` or `du -sk /*` to see how much space each
individual directory is taking.  It is displayed in kylobytes, hence the
-k option.

Even better, do this:

du -akl / | sort -n

That will show the size in kilobytes of every file and directory on /
but limited to only the root file system. Sort it numerically to see the
large users of space at the end.

May take a while to run, depending on the size of the filesystem...

I'd do

   du -sh /*

If you've got remote mounts, SMB or NFS filesystems, then you'll want 
to be a bit more targeted in what you search, e.g.,

   du -sh /bin /etc /lib /opt /sbin /tmp /usr /var

Subject: [PLUG] Uncooperative NICs
Message-ID: <20040916183224.GA21328@nellump.net>

I've tried in vain for some time now to get my old dual-proc SuperMac
S900 to work properly with more than the OEM 10 Mb NIC installed. I've
had relatively little difficulty with Debian 'unstable' on this box. It
successfully boots either 2.4 or 2.6 kernels. Networking fails in
various ways when I install a second NIC. Usually, the installed devices
can still be configured, but they just don't respond to any attempts to
communicate over the network. For instance, attempting to request a DHCP
lease fails as if there were no other hosts on the network.

I've tried two different NICs: a 100Mb LinkSys and a gigabit
RealTek-based model. Both exhibitied similar behaviors.

When booted from the 2.4.25-powerpc-smp-pmac kernel, I can get the
gigabit card to be recognized, and can configure the device, but at the
first sign of network activity (pings from another machine, in this
case), the SuperMac essentially locks up, spewing "too much work at
interrupt" down the monitor.

When booted from the 2.6.8-powerpc-smp kernel, I don't even have to have
a second NIC installed to cause problems. I can probe in the r8169
RealTek gigabit driver (which I don't think I *should* be able to do
when the card isn't even installed), which immediately kills the OEM NIC
-- it just won't configure any longer. Attempting to remove the r8169
module freezes up the machine.

I've also tried shuffling around the PCI cards. I removed both the ATA
and video cards, leaving only the gigabit NIC in PCI slot #1. With this
arrangement, I was able to probe in the appropriate modules for both the
built-in NIC and the PCI NIC ('mace' and 'r8169', respectively), and was
also able to successfully configure both.

Then things got weird. I only had one Ethernet cable to play with, so I
would alternate back and forth trying to get one or the other to talk to
my PC. The built-in NIC worked fine. It would respond to pings and I
could SSH in. The PCI (gigabit) NIC would not work at all. However, if I
pinged the IP address assigned to the PCI NIC while the cable was still
plugged into the built-in NIC, it would happily pong back. Very odd. It
seems as if somehow both eth0 and eth1 are being assigned to the
built-in NIC, even though by most signs this is clearly not the case.

I'm pretty much out of ideas here. I'd rather avoid having to break down
and buy an x86 box, but if I have to... Any ideas?

   lsof tells you what files are open; fuser tells you what files are using

Thanks all.  I'll put those in my notebook.  Which leads me to another

My other question.

So, me and another were discussing how we get these little tips and
help on all the items and machines we maintain or programs we use but
rarely.

What I'm trying to come up with is a way to sort and organize those
notes.  I would like to make them a DB and web base accessed.  I could
design one but wondered if any of you have ever come across a tool
that helps you organize such things?  Currently I have a text file on
my desktop called notes.txt.  I can read it from windows/*nix machines
but it seems very crude and I can't read it when I'm away from those
machines and have to keep multiple copies.

Suggestions?

Thanks for the other help on HD.

Josh

I've never really found a good way to do that. Its all about memory, and 
the following command:

nermal%> apropos "open files"
lsof            lsof (1m)       - list open files
lsof            lsof (8)        - list open files

What I do is keep an emacs-based "logbook".  M-x add-logbook-entry
inserts a date-stamp at the end of a file, ~/logbook/YYYY-MM-DD.log
and I type whatever notes I have about what I am doing, have recently
done, anything I want to hang onto, then a C-x C-s saves it.  I've got
these notes going back to January 1997.

The logbook mode is something I hacked together from an existing,
bundled changelog mode.

For retrieval, I rely on grep and less.

Secure shell means never having to say goodbye (at least as long as

I had the same problem for awhile.  What I ended up doing was create a 
MySQL database with some tables that would allow me to organize things 
in my own way.  Then I created a web page using PHP that will display 
the categories I want and when I click on it I can see all my notes for 
that category.  It's not perfect by any means but it works better than 
storing all of this info in a text document.

It sounds like there are a lot of votes for SquirrelMail.
Currently my mail directory hierarchy is in simple Unix
file format, one file per "folder" (as would be read by
either the old BSD "mail" program.) Netscape/Mozilla can
also read it, though they add some "summary" files of
their own.

Can anyone tell me if SquirrelMail will be able to deal
with the directory tree, or what I might be in for
converting it to something that SquirrelMail can use.
It that's not a big issue, then I'm ready to give it
at try.

SquirrelMail is just a web front-end; you'll need to supply your own 
IMAP daemon.

According to the docs, SquirrelMail can use any "IMAP4rev1 server 
(e.g. uw-imap, courier-imap, cyrus-imap, [hMailServer], Binc IMAP, 
CommuniGate, MS Exchange Server, MercuryMail 32, [Dovecot])."

Well that would be the fastest but others may complain when they lose
their connection to the other HD's that I wanted to look at after they

Exactly what I was thinking of doing. Would you be willing to share
the PHP files?

I tried this but it returns this for me:

/usr/bin/apropos: line 96: [: open: unary operator expected

I read up on apropos that sounds like a good idea.  I just need to see
how to make it work.  thanks.

A wiki is a pretty good idea for this, but you'd have to control who has
access to it and it depends on PHP scripts and a DBMS. It may be worth
asking yourself, for your own personal notes, do you really need all that
horsepower? And how much effort do you want to expend maintaining it 
(think upgrades on all the technology that a wiki depends on)?

In the old days, sea captains and scientists kept logs or notebooks, and 
documented their work in chronological order. We still have many of 
these notes today, and they are still accessable to the naked eye. I used 
to use Word star, but those notes are long gone, dust in the wind.

Today, we can do the same with text files and better yet, we have tools
like grep. Plain text documents never go out of fashion like so many
exotic digital formats (word star, Word .doc, TeX, html, XML, etc.) Keep
them online and access via SSH, and you've got what you need. Text is easy
to migrate into the future digital media, easy to print, and with a little
discipline in how you structure your entries, you can also run it through
awk and/or sed and reformat into other formats or create indexes.

Text is the best.

Depends.  I keep a lot of stuff on my wiki: http://nakedape.cc/wiki/

I was getting spammed a bit, so I had to set ACLs so only registered
users could post.

   Also in the old days of DOS I used a TBMS (Textbased Management System)
called InfoSelect that let me enter random notes and retrieve them by
sequential character matches. Very powerful program. Never found a full-text
index system like this in linux. Unfortunately, it stopped working on a
dosemu upgrade. Perhaps it's time to try again. Real Soon Now, that is.

Does anyone know if FreeGeek will consider an elderly DEC VT220
terminal to be a "monitor" and ask me for a donation to handle
"disposal?" I need to know if I can just drop it off or stick it with
the four or five deceased monitors in the garage waiting for me to
cough up the donation for them.

As I recall from a volunteer stint there, anything with a CRT has to be 
shipped up to Seattle for special processing. That's why they charge the 
$10 fee, since they would otherwise lose money by accepting monitors, 
terminals, etc.

"ISP style" ??

SquirrelMail talks IMAP (usually to localhost)... so if your IMAP server
supports Maildir, SquirrelMail does, as well.

Inspired by Adam Shand, PTP and others I use a wiki.

Web accesible, web editable, full text search available by default with
most models.

Check http://www.spack.org/wiki/AdamShand (search for an item of interest
  or browse recent changes) for a great example.

Adam refers to it as his "thinking space."

What a topic.  I'm glad to see I'm not alone trying to figure this
out.  I do have some constraints that many others don't have.

1.  I don't have ssh everywhere I go.  Public terminals or friends
computers in foreign countries tend not to have a client. a web base
solutions seems the best(even if only for the next few years).

2.  I like to put things in DBs.  SQL is a standard I think will be
around for a long time.  I can sort by categories, create fields that
make sense and do a variety of searching or browsing of the data
something Text files don't do so well.

I do appreciate all the thoughts.  Some of you have some decent tools
that gave me some ideas.  I'll have to design a beginning project and
see where I go.

Thanks,

Josh

Hi folks,

How can I get CVS to tell me recursively all the files in a project

sometimes I get a "? filename.ext", which I could grep out of STDERR, 
but sometimes not.

Surely there is a CVS flag for this?

Wikis can be plain text and powered by Perl, Python, PHP, sh or whatever 
floats your boat.  

meme.patch.com is supported by a wiki that is text file based.

Hey, that's not bad! That's the first web page I've seen that works really
well with w3m (text based browser) too.  Kind of reminds me of the early
days of hypertext (remember that cool little tool HYTELNET?) back when
WAIS and Gopher were the future and WWW was just a telephone directory at

Hi Galen et al.,

The problem is that cvs is not giving me the '? newfile.ext' line.  On 
other projects it has, so I hacked it together as above.

However, the fact that on this project (different cvs versions? 
different flags?) it doesn't bother to complain about unknown files 
means I want to adopt the canonical method, lest in future I forget 
about some file.

I could write a find -exec with some grepping and piping, but invoking 
cvs for every single file seems silly.

I'm seeing those too. Same idea as the last wave of attacks; just more 
tries on more passwords.

You want to probe their defences and hack them back to shut 'em down?  
IMHO, that would be doing everyone a favor by taking out garbage that's

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0409170815210.31974@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Some may recall that my copy of 'less' reports a problem finding the
symbol `ospeed` and shows the previous file immediately above the current
one. Based on a hint from a friend, I used ldd to find which libraries are
used by less then I grepped for that symbol in the list of strings within
each library. Turns out that 'ospeed' is in libncurses.so.5.

   I want to recompile libncurses and less from the source provided on disk 4
of the Slackware distribution set. However, I don't know how to compile a
GNU utility. I assume there's no Makefile for an individual tool and I
assume that I need to use the same switches as everything else on the
system.

   What do I read to learn how to recompile ncurses and less?

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

When you unpack the source for ncurses and less, you should see a text 
file called INSTALL (or sometimes README.INSTALL). That should give you 
the rundown.

With most source archives that I have compiled, the steps are generally 
the same:
1) Execute "configure" script -- most often, this will generate a 
Makefile to install under /usr/local by default. You can override this 
by executing "configure --prefix=/your/path/here", so that would allow 
you to install over the top of the malfunctioning ncurses and less, 
wherever they are located.

2) Run "make" on the generate Makefile to build everything.

3) Run "make install", usually as superuser, unless you are just 
installing into your home dir.

Hope that helps.

Ed

Ed,

   I've done the configure; make; make install dance for years. However, I
was not aware that it was part of each individual source file in a
distribution.

The problem here is that you are encouraging another to break the law.
IANAL, but that sounds like an accessory to the crime.

I don't want to get into the whole debate. Suffice it to say that
Oregon law is pretty clear on what constitutes "Computer Crime".
Shutting someone else's system down without their permission seems to
fit the description. As Keith said, "Two wrongs don't make a right."

Yes, they are either criminals or zombies. The criminals need to be
reported. If they get enough reports, someone will eventually do
something. It has to make a big enough squeak before they will oil it.

The zombies need to be educated.

   I'm at the stage of testing the CUPS-1.1.20 printing system on the new box
(Slackware-10.0). Copied over /etc/cups/printers.conf and the related files.
Can see all printers with both /usr/sbin/printers and
http://localhost:631/admin.

   I sent a test page from the Web page to the laser printer for each of its
configurations[1]. Only the postscript/duplex version came out. All jobs are
in /var/spool/cups.

   With the former Red Hat system this was a symptom of the parallel port
device being stuck. I'd kill that process and cups would again print. This
is not the case now.

   What diagnostic tools are available to me? The configuations are correct
for the printer.

Thanks,

Rich

[1] There is the default definition, 'laser5', an explicit single-side
definition, 'laser5_non_ps' and the duplex printing 'laser5_ps'. The first
two are using the HP LaserJet 5 ppd while the latte uses the HP LaserJet 5M
ppd.

By running nmap you are not breaching their security. Sure, it may be impolite, but under the circumstances it is acceptable, especially since ssh password attacks are much less polite. If your attemps to contact and reason with the admin of the system fail, I think you should hack them and shut them down, if possible. True, two wrongs don't make a right, but it makes you feel a whole lot better. :)

You should review the use of .cvsignore files.  Sounds like that may be
your problem.  If you've such a file in your home dir', any patterns
therein will be ignored upon cvs updates to any repository.  Also, there
may be .cvsignore files in your "sandbox", which affect just the
directories where they appear.  Additionally, there is a global
.cvsignore in the CVSROOT directory.  Any one of those three may be
getting in your way.

cvs should show any new files, unless they are located under a new
directory.  If you have a new directory, you will need to 'cvs add'
the new directory before files in the new directory show up.

Another possibility is that cvs is intentionally ignoring your files.
https://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs-1.11.17/cvs_18.html#SEC178

If neither of these apply to your situation, please post an example.
It would also be useful to know what version of cvs you are using.

current file being viewed. This is particularly visible when looking at a
one-line file after looking at a several-screens file. Shrug. I've no idea
what to do about this issue.

   More information:

   When I look at the jobs page I see that every job is listed as 'aborted'
except the two I sent to the duplex definition. I've checked the
configuration of the printers and they appear correct. Perhaps it's a
PrintPro issue.

   I downloaded some audio files that end in .ram. When I try to play them
using RealPlayer (on my notebook), the counter moves along but no sound
comes out. These files are in /tmp and are quite small; approximately 60
bytes.

   What are these files and is there a way to capture the entire stream on my
system?

Thanks,

You might try one of the "passive" OS fingerprinting tools that do not
send packets to the remote system.  This is less accurate, but
probably good enough for your purposes.

For more info:
  * http://www.google.com/search?q=passive+os+fingerprinting
  * http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f.shtml

With regard to SSH, in addition to the usual local packet filtering
options, it's helpful to use the AllowUsers option in sshd_config as a
second layer of defense.  Most home systems only need to allow SSH
connections from a limited subset of hosts (e.g. work, other home
systems, etc.) so this added layer can be helpful.

Opinions vary, but most of the security professionals I've spoken with
think that for home users with few (if any) legal resources the best
thing to do is simply drop the traffic.  They even say that if you're
successfully hacked the best thing to do is reinstall, secure the
holes they used (if known) and move on with your life.  A quick note
to abuse at their-isp-if-known may be appropriate.

Interesting. My initial inclination was to blurt out that the 
following du invocations are nearly equivalent:

   du -h --max-depth=1 /
   du -sh /*

On review, however, I noticed some subtle but potentially significant 
differences:

1. The first will return the total for / in addition to the totals for
    each top-level directory.

2. Unless the -a (--all) option is given, the first will ignore
    non-directories, while the second will report on anything globbed
    by the shell wildcard.

3. The second is sorted alphabetically since the shell expands the
    wildcard before passing the list to du.

4. The second will ignore "invisible" directories (those beginning
    with a .).

Points 2 and 4 probably aren't significant for the root directory, but 
they certainly would be elsewhere in the file system...

Try typing

file /tmp/*.ram

to find out what the system thinks the files are.

I got two replies saying "hack them and shut them down", which is
illegal.  Please be careful, there are people in jail right now
who suggested (even in jest) illegal acts on a mailing list, and
a friend is about to be extradicted from Canada for that.  My
question was about running nmap and investigating the offending
sites, without penetrating them - does that break any laws, here
or elsewhere, or cause other bad results - not about going Rambo.  

I am not concerned about oughtas, but real experiences.  I don't need
my Comcast feed shut down because my own activities look like system
cracking to their traffic analysis.   When I nmap my own site from
another, for example, I always inform relevant sysadmins so they
know what to expect.

I would still like a reply to this one.  I would think that some
organization with impressive letterheads and lawyers would be a
lot more likely to get attention from an ISP.

Happy Friday.

Had some problems with the disk I spoke of yesterday and all is
appearing better.  But now I was asked about some mount options that
to me don't seem to be a big deal.  Looking for some insight or
suggestions.

The ones in question:

journal=update,data=journal

>From what I see these just change the order in which date is written
into the journal vs. the file system.

Of these options should I be using them?  data=ordered or writeback
better?  Is there a best practice here?

Thanks,

Josh

Keith,

   Isn't this the reason for RBLs? Do they shut down only mail traffic or all
traffic?

Ah.. the 1st amendment at its finest.

I think we should kill the president. Is murder an illegal act? Oh well, 
I still think is should be done.

I find it vey hard to believe someone is in jail for suggesting an 
illegal act, unless they took some part in it themselves.

Also note that (I'm pretty sure) the original poster said that he was

In my first reply, I suggest du -akl / | sort -n, which was incorrect. I
confused the -l option from the df command, when I really wanted the -x
option for du.

The -x option will skip directories on other file systems, so
du -akx / | sort -n
should be a good suggestion for his issue.

They are, effectively, URL's to the sound stream.  

And, yes there *is* a way to capture the entire stream on your system.
I've used it.  Unfortunately for you it has been a while and I don't

Russell,

   Nope. That's been taken care of with aumix.

> They are, effectively, URL's to the sound stream.

   Well, there I go. It's difficult to play a URL. Perhaps it needs a fresh
download each time I want to play it because they've moved it to a new spot
on the server. Or something.

Thanks,

mplayer has a 'dump stream' option that will save a stream to disk
instead of playing it. It will also handle Real Audio files if you have
the appropriate codecs installed.

Robert you can do this in your /etc/postfix/alias file.

Add a line like:

localuser:  remoteuser at remotehost.com

This will forward all may to that local user to the remote site.  I
think it is a tab after the : so be careful.  I just let VirtualMin do
the work for me so I forget the syntax.

Then reload Postfix.

Subject: [PLUG] Logwatch doesn't
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0409171538020.7989@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   For years the logwatch script in /etc/log.d/scripts just did its thing and
sent me a mail message every morning with a summary of ssh cracking
attempts, unmatched entries in /var/log/messages and other useful stuff. It
was installed with the Red Hat packages and I've grown rather fond of the
thing.

   Now my Slackware-10.0 box is not running the script and sending me the
results. I found a slack package for logwatch-5.5.4 which I thought worthy
of replacing my logwatch-2.2 so I installed it. It appears to be a
repackaging of a Red Hat rpm. It doesn't do /var/log/messages or
/var/log/syslog because it cannot find services for them in
/etc/log.d/scripts/services. It doesn't complain about /var/log/secure so
I'm 1/3-there.

   What do folks running Slackware use for a logwatch script (run by cron and
directed in /etc/cron.daily)?

Thanks,

Rich

No tab and no reload.  Just run 'newaliases'.

I personally mutter a lot under my breath and vent around the office when
I see them in my logs.  But my solution has been to put in iptables rules
to reject which tends to suck their connection in for a minute or two.  
   Second line is the allow_users setting in sshd_config.

My plans include adding the iptables tar-pit module to all my systems and
suck them in for several minutes (12-20 if I remember correctly).

Funny thing was last night I couldn't get to one of my systems to demo
some scripts because of these measures.  I'm by no means an expert/guru
(nor do I play one on Reality TV :-) but the simple things work and let me
sleep a little better.

I have no qualms about running nmap against a system that is abusing
(intentional or unintentional) my systems.  It should be thought of as
looking out the peep hole in the front door to see who is ringing the bell
or knocking on the door.  (Heck I've got some of them patterned -- and
don't even answer the door.)

Given that there are already several other headers that make it bloody
obvious that the message is coming from the mailing list, could we
drop the grandiose [PLUG] tags in the subject lines?  We know what
list it is, and the tags fairly regularly get in the way of people
replying, making the list harder to filter by subject later.

So, given that the tags are redundant and are doing more harm than
good, could we just dump that throwback from before procmail's time
already?

That's not what I used.  It was something generic that captured any
soundcard output.  Or maybe it intercepted what was going to be sent
to the sound card.  v<something>, I think.

   I know there's a way to specify the X host but I can't find it in my saved

   Logged in as a user and running the X Window System. In a virtual terminal
I 'su -' to root. Now I want to run the OpenOffice.org's 'spadmin' program
so I can add fonts to what OO.o sees. The X server responds that it cannot
open the display.

   Is my only option to log out, then back in as root and startx from that
login? There must be a linux-guru way but I cannot find it. Pointers
appreciated.

It's a permissions issue.  Before you 'su -' run the command `xhost +`.

I occasionally use this:

   $ slogin root at localhost

But this (or something close) should work too:

   $ ssh root at localhost <your-Xapp-here>

If ssh X forwarding is working, then that should paper over any
permission problems.

Ever since I became aware of ssh lo-those-many-years-ago I have sort
of deprecated xhost.  I can't remember the last time I used it.
Whether that is rational or not, I'll leave to others to judge.

Here's the obligatory warning the doing xhost + is very insecure. 
Security is opening permissions only as far as you need them.  A more
secure procedure is the issue:

xhost +localhost

This way you open your X windows only to your local machine.  Likewise
you could add the your systems on your LAN, if you want by issuing:

xhost +<host name>

Try the 'su' command without the "-".  This will give you root
privileges without the root environment.  Since your environment won't
change, 'spadmin' should fire right up.

Another option is to change to a console, login as root, then run
'startx :2'.  This will start another X-server on <ctrl><alt><F8>.

Ken,

   According to 'man xhost' the plus is superfluous but the permissions can
be granted to either a host or a user. I tried 'xhost +root' and 'xhost
root' without success in running the spadmin app.

   Aha! That worked -- as far as getting spadmin to run. Still cannot see
fonts or directories. I'm gonna' check permissions now.

Another option to find out what kind of machine it is is to contact
their sshd:

$ telnet 62.193.225.66 22
Trying 62.193.225.66...
Connected to 62.193.225.66.
Escape character is '^]'.
SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_3.5p1
^]
telnet> quit

Sometimes this can tell you what distro it is (no luck this time). On my
debian system this is what I see:

SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_3.8.1p1 Debian 1:3.8.1p1-8

Other people have found the attackers to be running an old RedHat.

The only reason I can see to maintain using the tags is because some

So set the DISPLAY environment variable or use the -display option in
OO.o.....

export DISPLAY=:0

...to set the display to the main localhost display.  :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Dualing DNS over VPN
Message-ID: <200409181146.50888.griffint@pobox.com>

I have a host on private network 'A' that is occasionally linked via
VPN to private network 'B'. Each network has its own DNS server that
resolves host names for its own private net.

When the VPN link is up I want the VPN-linked host on network 'A' to be
able to resolve host names on both of the private networks. If I list
both name servers in /etc/resolv.conf it doesn't work because the lookup
won't fail over to the second name server unless the resolver can't
connect to the first server. What I really want it for it to fail over
to the second name server if the first one doesn't resolve the query.

One option would be to have the 'A' DNS server forward requests to the
'B' DNS server, but that would be awkward for just an occasional VPN
connection. Plus the 'A' DNS server doesn't have visibility of the 'B'
network anyway unless I set up routing through the VPN-linked host.

Any other ideas for getting what I want?

Thanks,
Terry

"vsound", perhaps?

   Virtual loopback sound recorder and real audio converter This program
   allows you to record the output of any standard OSS program (one that
   uses /dev/dsp for sound) without having to modify or recompile the
   program. It uses sox to convert and save the raw data into the
   desired file format and can help to convert real audio files to some
   other non-proprietary format.

The nice thing about mplayer is that it does the decoding before
dumping, leaving you with a common WAV file that can be played in any
number of ways. Of course, if you don't need any decoding to be
peformed...

Edit the source and rebuild.  Note that you can't change the SSH-1.99
part; that's part of the protocol version identifier and the handshake
will probably not work right if you change it.

root is not a host name.  localhost is a host name.  8:o)

Connection refused means that you got a RST and there is no SSH daemon
listening.  You need to install sshd and start it before you can ssh
to yourself.

xhost + is not what you want, that allows anyone, anywhere access to

One option is to setup a caching nameserver on the host.  One 
possibility is forwarding the private domains to the private name 
servers.  This would mean that the VPN network lookups would timeout 
when disconnected.  Another way is change the configuration when 
connecting to the VPN.

dnsmasq is supposed to be perfect for this situation.  It only does 
forwarding and caching.  It is supposed to have per-domain forwarding 
and be easy to change the configuration.

Why not just add the zone for network 'B' to the 'A' DNS server?

Paul,

   From 'man xhost':

        [+]name The  given  name  (the  plus  sign is optional) is
                added to the list allowed  to  connect  to  the  X
                server.   The  name  can  be a host name or a user
                name.

   Last sentence. Root is a username.

Subject: [PLUG] mysql performance questions
Message-ID: <8db4a1910409181730673eb496@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

I'm looking to optimize queries on a really really big dataset in
mysql. I've heard rumors that you can force MySQL to push a table into
memory (if you've got enough space) and think I have a way to do it,
but am not sure after reading the documentation if it really does what
I want or if there's actually a better way. What I'm trying is

create table tblheap type=heap select * from tbl;

The queries include multiple joins, where clauses, and order by
criteria. I've also attempted to create indexes which help the queries
go faster, and have succeeded to some extent, but I'm still confused
about how to deal with the fact that there are very different fields
in the joins, where clauses, and order by. Which of these need the
fields included in the index, and is there any way that order can use
a different index than the rest? I understand explain and use it
extensively, but if someone has a good suggestion for reading to
better understand the art of designing indexes around queries, I'd
appreciate that too.

Thanks,

Jeff

JetDirect card that just arrived (just the card, no documents at all), then
learn how to make it work over the network with CUPS.

   Has anyone done this?

I believe there's a plate on the right end of the back of the printer,
held on with 2 screws.  Power off the printer, undo the screws, and
take the plate off.

There should be card guide rails that you can fit the JetDirect card
into and slide it home.  The last 1/4" will take a bit of force.  Then
screw in the screws attached onto the back of the card and you're done.

Power up the printer, and hit the left Menu key 'til you see the HP
MIO Menu.  You can do config of the card there, though I think it'll
do DHCP or BootP by default.

It'll act as a "socket" printer and an LPR printer, among other things.

In CUPS, it's as simple as "socket://printer_address" or
"socket://printer_address:9100" or "lpr://printer_address/lp"

Windows will deal with it as either sort as well.  I've had better
luck if everything that prints to it used LPR mode.  Socket mode has
problems with job collisions if two machines try to print at the same
time.

Yes, except it's never actually worked.  At least, I've never seen it
work:

$ xhost +root
xhost:  bad hostname "root"
$ xhost + root
xhost:  bad hostname "root"

I ran into this years ago dealing with Solaris and at some point I
actually found someone somewhere who corroborated that.

Actually, if you read the Xsecurity man page, you'll see that it uses
examples for NIS and Kerberos with usernames.  That makes sense, since
both provide a means of identifying the user on the other end of the
connection.  Straight TCP or UNIX socket connections do not.

My xhost/X server isn't compiled to support Kerberos 5, so despite the
fact that I have it setup, it doesn't work either:

$ xhost + krb:root at EXAMPLE.COM
xhost: not compiled for Kerberos 5
xhost:  bad hostname "krb:root at EXAMPLE.COM"

Message-ID: <20040919060954.GA2732@gate.kl-ic.com>

Remember Kevin Cosgrove's message of Sat, 22 May 2004?

This has been happening to me for the last 3 days.   My server is on a
UPS;  it has been going down (to the beep of the UPS), and coming back
up around 6:16:11 AM, same time within a second for 3 days running.
Remarkably precise.

Nothing scheduled in cron at that time (I thought, read on) so I said
"bad UPS".  I took the machine down and restarted, stopping on the
GRUB splash screen.  Unplugged the UPS feed, the power went out.  Bad
UPS.  Opened the UPS and probed the two 12V, 17AH batteries in
there;  loaded each with a 1 ohm resistor.  One made 12 amps (good)
and the other made none (toxic waste).  Fortunately, I had a spare
battery, so I rebuilt the UPS and she's good to go.  

So what was causing the clock-precise power glitches?  Casting around
the house, I looked at the digital furnace timer.  The clock (battery
powered, feh) was off by 1 hour and 16 minutes.  The furnace is set to
come on at 5AM, when my wife gets ready for work.  It's been kinda cold
these last few days, so the furnace has started turning on for the 
season, but an hour and 16 minutes late.  Furnace blowers start out
at a dead stall, and the furnace circuit is on the same power leg in
the fuse box as the computer feed.  There seems to be an ohm or so
of extra resistance in the neutral leg of the PGE feed, so when a motor
stalls on the same power leg as the UPS, the power is glitched low
enough to trip the UPS.  Which promptly cuts out line, and starts 
attempting to make power from the (gutless) battery.

What is really fortunate, though, is that if the furnace timer had been
coming on at the correct time, and creating the glitch at 5AM, it would
have been right near the end of the backup cycle that starts at 4AM,
and this might have damaged my backup file system - certainly those
morning backups.  Backups are usually complete before 6AM.  So I lucked
out, actually.

The moral of the story is, sometimes weird-time precision is something
besides a computer ...

If you've got `sux` installed, that is one option that will take care of
everything for you. Alternatively the `su -m` will work.

You don't get an F for suggesting `xhost +`, but you get a D for
suggesting a not quite as insecure thing needed in one environment. Doing
`export XAUTHORITY=<your home dir>/.Xauthority` is my prefered solution
if `sux` is unavailable. The `chmod` is not needed in most places as root
can be root and read the .Xauthority file. In the environment where
you're on NFS and root is not trusted, it is far better to do
`cp -p .Xauthority /tmp/Xauthtmp` as yourself and setting XAUTHORITY as
appropriate, letting root grab it from there, rather than expose your X
tokens to everyone.

Russell,

   That's what I thought, too. I spent a good amount of time searching HP's
Web site and found manuals for all sorts of different LaserJet models, and
for PCL-5 but not the LJ 5 printer. There is one for the LJ 5i/MX, but
that's quite different.

Have been working with a sibling recently on a LTSP deployment (Portland
school district), trying to lend a hand where I could in support of his
effort.  I have a small bit of knowledge with Linux and wanted to help
but I have become painfully aware that I need to fine tune my knowledge
on several points; etherboot and PXE.  My questions are:

If  a PC's bios does not contain the option of network booting, can it
still netboot from either an etherboot or PXE enabed nic?

Can either the etherboot or the PXE card have an imaged flashed to it in
the same fashion as updating the bios rev of a PC, I.E. and executible
file that runs from a floppy disk when the PC is set to boot from the
floppy drive.

Thanks for taking the time.

   When I installed Slackware I deliberately left out KDE and Gnome. However,
in order to get gnucash running again I need the gnome core libraries. When
I look through the file list for gnome packages on the slack cdrom I don't
see a 'libcore' or anything like that.

   I know that several of you use gnome. I'd greatly appreciate a pointer to
the core libraries I need to install in order to run gnucash. And, no, I
can't run 'ldd gnucash' until I get it installed.

Thanks,

Hey Tim,

First things first, there is a list dedicated specifically to 
LTSP in schools:

This must have been the school at yesterday's clinic that had the
funky etherboot images that retrieved the kernel via NFS rather than
the standard TFTP.

Yes.

If the nic has PXE (at least if it is version 2 or later), you should
not need to change it. Just use the stock PXE.

If it has a BOOTP bootrom (such as etherboot), you can flash a new 
image. I'm not sure if you need a new chip, the few times I've seen
this done it a special rom burner was used. I'm sure others can give
you a more definitive answer.

It is easy to make a floppy image with a boot rom. There is even a
"Universal" boot floppy image that works with most network cards.
I have a local copy at:

   ftp://k12linux.mesd.k12.or.us/pub/K12LTSP/Universal_boot_floppy/

You can make your own custom etherboot images using rom-o-matic:

	http://rom-o-matic.net

Rom-o-matic lets you build all sorts of boot rom images, from floppy,
dos executable, lilo/grub formats, etc, etc.

Aaron,

   I was thinking that the extra memory and PostScript module was behind
there, too. Those are in a different place. That's why I wanted to look at a
manual. This is all done.

   OK. I have network cfg = yes* and tcp/ip = yes*.

   How do I assign it a network address?

   See above. Do I edit /etc/hosts and add an address there for lpr; e.g.,
192.168.55.124	lp0.appl-ecosys.com  lp0

   When the JetDirect 600N for the Professional Series 2500C gets here I'll
need to configure that within CUPS, too.

Many thanks,

I would guess the interface on the printer itself probably has a means
of changing the IP address.  Or, potentially, telnetting to it somehow.
nmap the IP and see what all is open...

Really, though, it might be easier if you just set up a DHCP server.
They're pretty easy to maintain and make adding or removing machines
from your LAN just that much easier.  :-)

   Could be that there is one. I'll go look.

   With the few nodes I have here? Static IP addresses have worked well the
past seven years. Once I get the printers configured, too, the setup is
stable for the next few years.

Thanks, Rich.  Now that I have a machine that has more common hardware, and I 
have a distribution running that seems reliable, stable, and works smoothly, I'm 
going to be able to give it a try. It will be nice if OO can do all the things 
WP does, but I'm not going to hold my breath (reveal codes and print as booklet 
come to mind).

   No.       Yes.

   No word processor can do what WP did. OO.o's Writer emulates winWord
(gag!) so it's "comfortable" for those considering defenestrating. We're
stuck with what we have.

   However, that's really not limiting. If you want to do serious writing
(articles, reports, books, etc.) use LyX. If you want to do desktop
publishing with a frame-oriented page layout application (sensu Framemaker,
Ventura Publisher) use Scribus. For the rest (letters, memos, invoices and
the like) OO.o does just fine.

Has anybody looked in to writing a WP-like CLI wordprocessor for *nix
under an OSS license?

I have a feeling such a thing would be pretty popular, at least among
those who had computers back before WordPerfect for Windows.

One trick is to plug the name of the file that rpm says you need into 
rpmfind.net and see what packages provide it.

Or you can run 'rpm -qRp somePackage.rpm' to get the whole bloody list
of dependencies, both met and unmet.

You can also run 'rpm -qp --provides somePackage.rpm' to see what a 
given package provides.

I'm guessing that you're going to need a few gnome packages.  If you
have a gnome-libs, install that and try gnucash again to see if you
get any further.

Wouldn't that be a text editor with most common TeX formatting codes

They all switched to Word because of the network effect (and the thorough
sucktitude of WPWin) and forgot the keyboard shortcuts.

Then you get to set config tcp = yes.  At that point, you can set

If you want.  I just use the IP address, e.g. lpr://192.168.55.124/lp
(Note: LPR has you specifiy a print queue; lp is the default.)

Ali,

   Then I'd need to run the file through rpm2tgz. I'm building from source if
I cannot locate a Slackware package that has it.

   I have a gnome-x.x.x which is the "core" libraries. I grep'd all the
packages for 'gnome-config' and found nothing. On my google search I turned
up a bunch of messages with the same problem: missing gnome-config holding
up configuration of some package. Didn't see any solutions, though. I also
tried to search the gnome.org Web site but didn't see a search widget or any
indications of where gnome-config might be hiding.

   Gnucash does OK, but it has so many dependencies on things that no other
application I use uses it's rather a PITA to get it re-installed on the new
platform. Sigh.

Many thanks,

Rich

Not all went the Word route.

My parents stuck with Word Perfect for Windows up until about four years
ago, when they finally relented and moved to Word.  I never really got
in to Word, myself.

I think a lot of folks still remember the shortcuts, as well, or would
be reminded, given the chance.  :-)

I'll give those a try, but I'm really spoiled. I'd like to keep thinking about document writing with one tool--at least for the kinds of documents I write.

My wife still uses WP 5.1 on a Wyse 286. For grunt work typing it still works just fine, and we have yet to find a keyboard like the one Wyse sold with their PC's. (It doesn't work with other PC's, I've been trying for many years. If someone knows how to make it work, let me know!)

> Has anybody looked in to writing a WP-like CLI wordprocessor for *nix

Too bad Novell sold WP to Corel. If they still had it, maybe someone could convince them to release the code to WP 5.1. As I recall, WP 6, while a DOS program, tried to hold on to their customers early in the "let's all use GUI's" mentality era. It didn't go over that well. I think that was about the time Win 3.1 came out, along with Word.

I just installed the personal edition of Suse on one of my machines. During the install, they had a series of "ads" for various tools included in the distribution. One of them was for Wine. It said that MS Office had been tested and works under Wine. One of these weeks, maybe I'll try to get WP 8 to work; maybe that will be one of these months, the way my schedule has bee going of late!

WP is still alive in version 12, I think. I am currently using version 9 on 
windows.

They put out a version of Linux a couple years back with WordPerfect on the 
CD.

I did a search for Linux on their site a few days ago and got a page for 
Linux WP (product not available - better than no hits)

Thanks

Rob,

   I started with WP-4.0/DOS in April, 1984 and used it on linux (WP/8) until
the upgrade from the 2.0 kernel with libc5 to the 2.2 kernel with libc6.
That's 18 years of using the application in character mode (but on linux
most of the keystroke shortcuts worked just fine). It was a highly
productive tool for me. I heartily dislike having to remove my hands from
the keyboard to manipulate the trackball just to activate some menu item or
dialog box widget.

   This situation is a great example of what I've been saying for years:
while all progress involves change, not all change involves progress.

Dick,

   By all means, pick the appropropriate tool for the writing you do most
often. I've come to really like the LyX frontend to LaTeX and it is highly
productive for me.

   I had long e-mail exchanges with the head of Corel's WP/7-8 support group
for linux. They had patches written and ready to go for bugs that I
encountered but upper management would not permit the release. They also
wanted to do a native linux port but that was denied also. It turns out that
all that time Corel was talking with Microsoft about financial assistance.
They got that. Then Microsoft insisted they kill the WP/linux efforts and
that whole team (who had done the original UNIX port for Novell) was let go.
Once it was dead, I read, Microsoft pulled out. Or, at least, scaled way
back in their financial support of Corel. Same behavior Redmond has
exhibited for two decades.

   The last version of WP/DOS that I ran was 6.02c. It was terriffic! I
almost got it working on linux under dosemu, too.

   Germane to wine: don't use any on a distribution set because they are too
old. Grab the latest build from the winehq.org Web site and build that. I
almost have MapInfo working on wine. When I get there I no longer need
VMware.

Apparently, with modern whois clients (like the one that prints
"no whois server is known"...), you simply give a thing, and it
figures out the right server.

So, whois 80.191.126.26 gives me back some network in Iran.

Start by running "whois" and then seeing:

$ whois
usage: whois [-aAdgilmQrR6] [-c country-code | -h hostname] [-p port] name ...

and then trying

whois -h whois.ripe.net 80.191.126.26

and I believe you'll see the behavior you're expecting.

   Furthermore, it's all documented in the man page. But, looking at that
didn't occur to me because I've been using it for so long.

Ryan,

   As Randal pointed out to me, the current version of 'whois' tries to
identiry the proper whois server on its own and doesn't like the assistance
on the command line. Typing only 'whois <IPaddress>' works as intended.

   It's on the man page, but I didn't think to look there as I've been using
the tool for so long I assumed I knew the syntax.

Thanks,

Rich

   Thanks, Rogan. I was under the mistaken impression that I got the
development libraries, too, when I built the whole thing from source. I'm
now on Slackware, btw.

   Interesting that the libxml2 Web site has only an rpm for the 2.6.13-devel
package. I'll run that through rpm2tgz.

   Rogan got me on the right track. Installing the devel libraries eliminated
the last missing dependency. Interesting that the Slackware source disk does
not have the -devel library packages. However, as long as rpm2tgz works --
which it did quite well here -- it's OK.

   No, it didn't eliminate the missing dependency; I was in the wrong

I've kicked myself for ages for not saving my old WP/DOS floppies. For 
writing/editing, I've never experienced its equal: fast, flexible, 
powerful.

I liked, and used heavily, WP/Windows -- but WP/DOS (4.x though 5.x 
and up to 6.x) got me through graduate school and the first couple 
years of my professional career. Nothing really replaced it, IMO. I 
probably still have my license file around... :-)

Postfix treats all entries as lower case.  If that's not what you 
want see the Q&A at:
   http://www.kobitosan.net/postfix/QandA-en.html#2.16

A. Postfix local daemon replaces uppercase letters of recipients with lowercase one, that is, mails for User, UsEr, USER are treated as for user. When you send a mail to a local user User, Postfix looks for not User but user and User can't receive the mail.

Translation into lowercases also happens when reading passwd file in local_recipient_maps and building aliases databases with newaliases, postalias commands.

If you want to have postfix receive mails for users whose name contain uppercases, you may need to configure as follows:

   1. add a map with the users to local_recipient_maps (you need an additional map because entries in passwd file are translated as lowercase).
   2. add a master.cf entry that calls case-sensitive MDA with pipe, and set the transport to $local_transport parameter. Don't use the u flag in pipe.

Message-ID: <008A26A81DAD96489E7D4FCF259849980180D8FB@eft01ms01.eft.fiserv.net>

Jeff,

Pinning a table in memory can be a "bad" thing.  If the table gets too large
at some point in the future, it could cause a lot of thrashing of the
database.  If you are convinced that it won't get that large, then it should
be ok.   

An article that explains it more in depth is:
    http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mysql/article.php/3077531

As far as joins go, mixing both integer and char (as an example) in the
where clause is fine.  Changing the order (joining on a char before joining
on an Int or vice versa) may have an impact.  However, joining a CHAR field
to an INT field is a no-no because a conversion has to be done before the
join can be accomplished.  Even adding a conversion to the join will
decrease performance (Example below).  (NOTE: This is a poor design - only
for example!)

Give the tables as below:

Table: Client
Id   INT
First VARCHAR (20)
Last VARCHAR (15)
Address1 VARCHAR (20)
Address2 VARCHAR (20)
City  VARCHAR (25)
State VARCHAR (20)
ZipInt INT
ZipId   INT

Table: Zip
ZipId   INT
ZipCode CHAR (5)
ZipInt  INT    //DON'T DO THIS when it's identified as CHAR 5 also!


Example
SELECT c.name, c.address, c.city, c.state, z.zip FROM client as c 
    LEFT JOIN zip AS z ON z.ZipCode = c.ZipInt  <-- BAD  Conversion
Required!

SELECT c.name, c.address, c.city, c.state, z.zip FROM client as c 
    LEFT JOIN zip AS z ON z.ZipId = c.ZipId  <-- BAD  Conversion Required!
    
NOTE:  Both assume that ZipId is indexed, as is ZipCode.  ZipId is a PK and
Identity.

Subject: [PLUG] mysql performance questions

hi,

I'm looking to optimize queries on a really really big dataset in mysql.
I've heard rumors that you can force MySQL to push a table into memory (if
you've got enough space) and think I have a way to do it, but am not sure
after reading the documentation if it really does what I want or if there's
actually a better way. What I'm trying is

create table tblheap type=heap select * from tbl;

The queries include multiple joins, where clauses, and order by criteria.
I've also attempted to create indexes which help the queries go faster, and
have succeeded to some extent, but I'm still confused about how to deal with
the fact that there are very different fields in the joins, where clauses,
and order by. Which of these need the fields included in the index, and is
there any way that order can use a different index than the rest? I
understand explain and use it extensively, but if someone has a good
suggestion for reading to better understand the art of designing indexes
around queries, I'd appreciate that too.

Thanks,

Jeff

Being a relative newbie at using pgp as well as thunderbird, is there 
are reference list members could point me to for learning how to use 
these effectively (namely enigmail and pgp)?

Karol,

   I missed the DHCP menu and the rest of 'em the first few times through.
This time I think I got it. I set the IP address and the gateway address but
I don't know what the SM BYTE and LG BYTE represent so I left them as they
were.

   Just tried pinging the printer (after adding its IP address and name to
/etc/hosts) but "destination host unreachable". So, something's still not
correct.

   We'll see in a week or so. The card left Orlando, FL on the 16th. If it's
not under water somewhere it should be on its way out here.

I don't know what the LG BYTE is and never have set it either.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0409201344090.14883@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Whew! What an ordeal. But, I have success to report. And, for those of you
running Slackware who want to use gnucash let me summarize what needs to be
done.

   There is a Web page HOWTO <http://rjmarq.org/gnucash.html> that's
invaluable. Because gnucash is a gnome-1.x application we need to install a
bunch of gnome libraries from Slackware-8.1 and -9.x, too. I started at the
top of the dependencies list on the gnucash Web site and worked my way down
the list getting and installing everything I did not have (i.e., almost
everything there). Resolved missing dependencies as they arose.

   Toward the end of the ./configure phase it got a little tricky because the
error message was that lgdal wasn't installed. It is. Reading config.log I
saw that it was the lack of two libgdal dependencies (Berkeley DB1 and
gdk-pixbuf) that held things up. I got those from the Slackware-9.0 disks
(since I accidently knocked the 9.1 set behind the bookcase in the back room
and it will take a frontend loader to clear a path to it). Anyway, it did
configure.

   During the make phase the process bailed out with an error because it
could not find ldb1 in /usr/X11R6/lib/. True. The library is installed in
/lib. So I made a softlink and the compiler was happy. 4min 26 seconds on
the Athlon XP 2100+ system with 1G RAM. Make install kept reporting warnings
that it appeared the library had been moved (it was seeing the link), but it
installed just fine.

   For some weird reason gnucash must be run as root before us reg'lar folks
can use it. I switched to a console, logged in as root, ran
'/usr/local/bin/gnucash', and logged out after being told the display
couldn't be opened. Back to the X session and it fired right up for me as a
user.

   Ugly, but there it is. Hope this helps someone(s).

   Thanks, Ryan.

   Also, it really helps to remember to press the "select" key after entering
values; they tend to not disappear that way. And, ... it woiks! Well, at
least I can ping it. Now to set up CUPS.

Cory,

   Thank you very much. I have it all set up from the front panel so I'll
save a 40.6M download for when I need it. It's interesting that you have
this only for RH 9 and SuSE; no source tarball for those of us running other
distributions.

   However, while I have your eyeballs, I have questions about firmware
upgrades. In the 6+ years I've had the LJ5 I keep asking why I cannot get a
firmware upgrade that runs on linux. One of the product folks admitted that
it was a bit silly to have a printer they'd sell with a HP-UX system but
which could not be upgraded from there.

   So, is there a way to upgrade printer (LJ5 and Prof. Ser. 2500C) and
JetDirect card firmware from a linux box?

Aaron,

   Interesting. I changed the Device URI to lpr://192.168.55.192/lp in
/etc/cups/printers.conf and the printers Web page won't load. Used the
command line to bring up /usr/bin/printers and sent a test page. Nothing's
happening. The process status list shows the job:

16978 ?        S      0:00 ipp://lj5/192.168.55.192/ 20 rshepard Printer Test Pa

but I don't know why it's suspended.

   Do I have a syntax error in the definition? In /etc/hosts I have:
192.168.55.192  lj5.appl-ecosys.com     lj5

and in /etc/cups/printers.conf I have:

   Aha! I'll bet it's the location, no? It's no longer directly attached to

   Reading the SAM again I see that location is just a meaningless string.
However, the DeviceURI has been changed to ipp: and I've followed the format
in the manual; that is, ipp://lj5/192.168.55.192/Port 1

   Tried sending a test page. It got up to 24% then said that network device
lj5 was busy and it would try again 30 seconds later.

   I have obviously erred in the syntax. Anyone know what I should have
there?

Thanks,

  There used to be a way to do it via SNMP.  You would use the "snmpset"
command to identify a tftp server address and the bin file.  The last
snmpset command would command the printer to load the file.  

  I used to do it from a Solaris machine many years ago when I needed to
install new software and fonts.  I don't know if it works with the LJ5.

http://www.ntop.org/ntop.html is where you can get instructions on how
to set CVSROOT to a remote repository for ntop and check out a copy.

I have a copy checked out.  If I want to update my copy of the
source code, can I update over a copy I've already 
checked out?  
  
Can I use my local copy as a CVS repository and check out a
copy from there or do I need to hand import the source code
I've checked out into my own local CVS server? 

Can one CVS repository update a second one?  
With this model, how do changes in the a local CVS repository
work back up to a remote one?  What if the remote CVS
repository isn't under my control?

I've noticed a directory called CVS in the source code.  What
are these special directories a CVS checkout creates for?

Yes. cd to the directory and run cvs update. You should not have to setup your CVSROOT again, as that info is stored in the CVS directories within the checked out heirarchy.

If you intend to version your changes and you do not have commit access to the repository you checked it out from you will need to import the code into your cvs repository.

> Can one CVS repository update a second one?

You could probably hack something together using the files in CVSROOT (commitinfo probably), but if you don't have commit access to the remote repository you won't be able to do it. Of course, if you had commit access, why would you want to version the files in your own repository anyway? You probably wouldn't. You should probably make your changes and ask a committer to commit the changes. You may even need to open a change request in the bug repository for the project and attach the diff to the change request. 
 
> I've noticed a directory called CVS in the source code.  What

There are few files in those directories... Root, Repository, and Entries (if memory serves me). Bassically these files tell cvs at runtime where these files came from and what they are (tag, branch, other sticky options). This is why you don't need to reset your CVSROOT every  time you decide to update your checked out heirarchy.

Yes, this is how you would do it.

See https://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs-1.11.17/cvs_13.html#SEC103
for more detail.

No.

You have to send a patch to someone with write access to the CVS
repository.  Once they validate that the patch is valid and useful,
they will put it in.

> What if the remote CVS repository isn't under my control?

See above.  The developers serve as gatekeepers to ensure that the
code that goes into the CVS repository is consistent with the code
standards for the project.

They hold metadata that describe the files in your CVS working area
(what you checked out).  They're all text files, take a look at them
and their contents should be pretty obvious.  (versions, dates,
locations of repositories/modules, etc.)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0409201804330.14883@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This is strange. The LaserJet 5 is pingable via hostname or IP address. I
can invoke /usr/sbin/printers and see it there. I _cannot_ load
http://localhost:631/printers. It hangs.

   Trying to send a test page to the printer results in nothing. I can send
the error_log if that helps. I hope that those of you who have set up
printers with the JetDirect card and CUPS can help me get this working.

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Trying to compile ntop...
Message-ID: <1095728561.4640.111.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Apparently it works on Redhat 9.  Not wanting to upgrade everything to 
Redhat 9 from Redhat 7.x at the moment, has anyone gotten this to
compile on Redhat 7.2 or Redhat 7.3?  It appears that libpcap has
changed or that make bombs because a 2.6 kernel is expected.

I want to use this to figure what kind of traffic is coming in and
going out through my gateways to see if I have a solid firewall, etc.

I'd like to figure out which priviledged tcp and udp ports 
McAffee and Panda Antivirus use.

I experimentally attempted a 2.6 upgrade on a Redhat 9 system
and mostly have it working except that I broke rpm.  I get errors
about not being able to open a db3 database.  Gentoo is probably 
better for an upgrade like this since it's a source compiled 
system.  The problem with upgrading Redhat 9 to 2.6 is that I
don't know which packages and libraries need to be replaced.
because they'll only work with a 2.4 kernel.

Maybe I should see about trying ntop out on WinXP or Win2000 just 
to see what it is.

I'm not sure if you can do this or not but you can use the JetAdmin
software to upgrade your firmware.

BTW, I am on the hp linux printing team. I know way more about inkjet
and AiO than LaserJets. See http://hpinkjet.sf.net and
http://hpoj.sf.net. I used to do JetDirect technical support... believe
me JetAdmin is your friend, although you can telnet into it or use the
front panel to configure the printer...

Message-ID: <1095730112.27424.19.camel@coryhome.comcast.net>

In the case of the LJ5, this looks like it's a PCL only printer. Some
laserjets are PostScript. Postscript PPDs can be obtained here:
http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/PPD/HP/

Otherwise, got to http://hpinkjet.sourceforge.net/install.php#other to
download and install hpijs.

After installing hpijs and restarting CUPS, go to http://localhost:631
Choose Add Printer
Enter root username and pass
Give the printer a meaningful name
Under device, choose socket/JetDirect
Enter the correct device URI. This should be something similar to 
     socket://192.168.1.100:9100
Then Choose HP
Then choose the model number closest to your printer 
Then choose finish. 
If you want to make any special settings like duplexing or tray or print
modes, you need to do that in CUPS.
Also, for each print mode you want ie draft, duplex, hi-res, make a
separate queue for each printmode by following the steps I just layed
out...

If you're getting libpcap errors, try ./configure --help to see what the 
option is to specify where libpcap is. Something like: 
--with-pcap=/path/to/it

Also, if it says you need a newer version, then just recompile a new one 
to a specific place.. and point to it when you run configure (like above).

Also, make sure /usr/src/linux points to the current kernel source (i.e. 
the same version of the kernel that's running).

Cory,

   The printer seems to be configured just fine. It's getting output to it
that has become an issue.

   If you know someone there who might have some other ideas that would be
very helpful.

   I can provide the CUPS error log (at debug level 2) for those who can
interpret it better than can I.

Hmm, I cat get to /printers, but hang trying to get to /admin. I 
recently replaced my winprinter (Lexmark X5150) with a HP PSC 2150 
network printer. I followed the instructions from 
http://linuxprinting.org/ for my device, and got the latest drivers from 
there as well. I expect Cory will be your best mentor for this one.

   It has two definitions: one for PCL6 the other for PostScript. I have the
PostScript module in it. The ppds have been installed. It works just fine on
a parallel cable.

   I can try the socket: rather than the ipp: or lpr: ... tomorrow when I
fire it up again.

   This -- and the inkjet -- have worked well on the parallel cables for
years. I've used CUPS for at least 5 years, too. It's the switch to the
JetDirect that's caused problems.

Check you Allow statements in you /etc/cups/cupsd.conf for you /printers

Message-ID: <20040921072356.22712.qmail@web50609.mail.yahoo.com>

I recently installed Fedora 2 and my initial
impression of it was sort of positive. I have a
Quickcam 3000 (Phillips chip), and discovered that it
does not have kernel support with Fedora, although Red
Hat 9 supported it.

Normally this kind of issue calls for rebuilding the
kernel. According to one source, however, this cannot
be done to enable the Quickcam with Fedora 2. Really?

I know that this driver is enabled automatically in
Mandrake, and can be enabled with a little effort with
SuSE. Can anyone recommend a Webcam that is more
widely supported under Linux? I don't know whether
this consideration alone would prompt me to use a
different distro than Fedora, but might incline me in
that direction.

Fedora 2 does not support FireWire without rebuilding
the kernel, either. This is another feature taken for
granted with many other distros.

I wonder if there is anybody in the Portland area who

live
twenty miles away I'm still interested).  I can't find
any archived ISO images (just empty directories), else
I
wouldn't be bothering you.  (I'm interested in x86, I
suppose I should say, in case they made others then.) 
My
apologies if this is the wrong place to ask this;
point
me at a better place if you want.  This is my first
try
at posting a message here. I apologize if there's an
etiquette I'm ignorant of.  (No hurry on this;
whenever
you want me to come get it is fine.)  Thanks.

Cory,

   Well! Apparently using 'socket' works while using 'ipp' or 'lpr' doesn't.
According to the SAM, the syntax is for the hostname, not IP address. Don't
know if it matters, but I have: socket://lj5:9100/ and ... it's working!

   Also, instead of using a PS defintition for the printer I use the
PrintPro-4.4 for the LJ5. One configuration is for the duplexer active, the
other for the duplexer inactive (A/P checks don't do well when printed
two-sided).

   Thanks to all of you. I have confidence that the Series 2500C will be
easier to get going now that I have this experience under my belt. (It's a
tight fit there, but I squeezed it in.)

Yes!

Also, if you send me your /var/log/cups/error_log I can look at it but
my suggestion would be to delete your queues and start fresh.

Have you tried the RedHat FTP site?  Many of the old versions are
there, but RedHat didn't start putting ISO images on their FTP server
until later versions:

ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/1.0/en/os/i386/
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/1.1/en/os/i386/
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/2.0/en/os/i386/

I didn't see 2.1 on their FTP site.  If you need this specific
version, contact me off-list.  I'm over in Beaverton but we can
probably work out some way to get them to you.

What he's looking for is from around 1995.  I have a November 1995
InfoMagic CD set, but I loaned the Red Hat disk to a friend in 1996 and
never got it back.

Mel,

   Not quite there. I installed 4.0 or 4.1 in August 1997. Releases 2.x and
3.x were prior to that.

Yes, I think that was the 6.0 I used to install on a Toshiba laptop. 
Then later, 7.3 on a Thinkpad.

I'm wondering what sit0 is when do ifconfig -a on my new 2.6 system?

I'm getting a mac address of 00:48:54:70:EB:41 showing up
which I haven't been able to track down.  NTOP says there's 
a non ip protocol called NULL LSAP looking at host stats
for it.  There are a lot of unknown protocol warnings about 
ip protocol 0x0.

Ntop isn't showing any ip for this MAC and it considers it
local.  Any ideas on how to track the source of this down?
Running ntop on another box, I haven't seen this MAC there.
I'm starting to wonder if it's a dhcp request for sit0.

I like to use this great search engine called "Google" when I have a
question that needs answering. Searching for "linux 2.6 sit0 interface"
brings up several links that would lead one to believe the sitX
interfaces have something to do with IPv6 tunneling over IPv4 networks.

   I suspect that we have participants who have been using sql-ledger for
their consulting (or other service-oriented) business. I'd appreciate
learning from you how to bend our needs around the product-oriented,
manufacturing/distributing set up of the application.

   Right now I'm trying to set up vendor invoices and I'm not allowed to
assign the to expense accounts but to a select few liability accounts. And,
I'm asked whether this invoice is for a part or service for each invoice
that I enter. I think I'm missing something here.

   I don't know perl. The VMware install scripts are designed for SysV-style init
systems (Red Hat, Mandrake) and not for BSD-style init systems (Slackware).
Slackware can accommodate the former (in rc.sysvinit), but the VMware
scripts do not put files where they can be run properly here. I'm sure it's
not difficult to adjust them so that I can install VMware-4.5.2 here (yes, I
have all the licenses and serial numbers), but I've no idea what I'm reading
in the scripts nor how to change them.

   Anyone willing to teach me by practical application?

It would have been nice if the instructions I had found on how to 
upgrade Redhat 9 to a 2.6 kernel mentioned
a few things.  I've noticed that iptraf for example doesn't work 
anymore.  It's easy to put a 2.6 kernel on Redhat
9, but it isn't so easy to figure out what's going to break.  I've 
decided to try replacing my Redhat 9 with Fedora
Core 1.  I can't get my ASUS CRW-5232AS drive to work short of upgrading 
to a more recent system
anyways.  I want to see if maple 9.02 works in Fedora.  I managed to get 
ntop working at least.  I'd say Redhat
9 isn't work if you don't already have it, it just has too many serious 
bugs.

Have you run the install scripts already?

I *vaguely* remembering installing VMWare on Linux some years ago but
it's not the recent version.

Does this help:

   Unfortunately, no. I had seen that. I cannot successfully run the
vmware-config.pl script to tune it for the current kernel.

Message-ID: <4150A885.9090502@robinson-west.com>

If an organization had say ten million dollars, could it get hardware 
schematics from companies like Intel and then gpl them
so that there's less guessing when it comes to supporting new hardware 
with an OSS driver?

It's ironic that companies have special procedures that have to be 
followed to set the machines they've designed up
and that often, especially with Dell, the computer owner has a hard time 
getting this information.

Not very many people can afford to set up a factory to use a company's 
schematics in order to manufacture
that company's product.  Even if Intel would release the hardware 
schematics for it's last generation that
could help fans of Linux and other operating environments.

Not having worked with vmware, I can't say that I'd be much help.  The obvious question, though,
is what results were you expecting and what results did you get?  Were there any error messages?

   Actually, I did get to this point succesfully. What I see when I try to
get vmware running is:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ vmware 
Cannot get temporary directory for log file.


VMware Workstation Error:
VMware Workstation unrecoverable error: (vmui)
Cannot get temporary directory for log file.
Please request support.  We will respond on the basis of your support

   I'm not sure where it's looking for the temporary directory for its log
files.

Thanks,

Ovid,

   Good pointer. It got me to look at the permissions on /tmp/vmware-rshepard
and the log file inside it. Those were copied from the restored tape backup
and had owner.group of my Red Hat UID.GID. Not valid here. I changed those
to current values and VMware fires up.

   Now to resolve a write permission problem with the log file and I think I
should be good to go.

Many thanks,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0409211646060.1487@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Within vmware the virtual win98 used to find E:\salmo\winstuff on
/mnt/usr2/winstuff. On the new installation it's on /data2/winstuff.

   I've looked in /etc/vmware/vmnet1/etc/smb.conf and changed the path there.
Now I'm trying to find where I can make this change within the virtual
winduhs machine. On the toolbar, under "Tools", I can see E:\\SALMO\WINSTUFF
but I cannot find where I repoint that to the linux mount point.

   A number of you use winduhs systems so I'd appreciate a pointer where to
change this so the virtual machine can exchange data with the real machine.

Thanks,

Rich

Been a long time lurker & thought I would introduce myself to all of
you.I have been using Linux for about 1 year on Macs & PC's. Currently
have it on a PC (SuSE 9.0) Getting a brand new iBook soon & will be
slapping Yellow Dog on it (can't wait as I love Yellow Dog)

Can't say I am really, really savvy with Linux, but I am getting there.

I need to get to one of the PLUG Meetings as I think it would be
interesting & fun to meet other Linux Users. Little bit shy though so I
think this is why it has stopped me from coming so far!! I have no
excuse though as I work just down the road from PSU. 

My Husband is a long time Linux User also....his flavour is Mandrake, 
Slackware or Red Hat. 

Just wanted to say Hello....

Maybe sometimes.  But why should it spend that money on paying a
dunderheaded company to be slightly less dunderheaded?
There are far, far better things to do with that kind of money.  

For instance, convince said dunderheaded company that it'd be worth
its while to spend its *own* money doing that.  
For example, the OSDL often specifies in its RFPs that suppliers
provide OSS drivers for its hardware.  No drivers, no sale.  
It's amazing what happens when the pressure comes from Marketing and
Sales instead of Engineering.

Also, has has been discussed here and elsewhere many times, many
OSS hardware support issues come down to the fear of exposing patent
violations.  There is no reasonable way to verify that your design is
totally free of violations, so opening up its specs can expose you to
very expensive lawsuits, even if the design is obsolete.

Dell is up there with IBM as regards providing information.  And
they're good about using industry-standard chipsets and suchlike.

Intel's already done an exemplary job of supporting Linux.  How would
schematics help?  Or are you a bit unclear on what "schematics" means?

   Thanks. I didn't think so but I didn't understand then why the Slackware

Rob,

   I've no idea. The other scriplets work just fine. I don't reboot this box
any more frequently than I really need to so it's not a major issue, just a
curiosity. It _should_ work but doesn'.

Mel,

   You're absolutely correct. It's on the Tool menu. I keep trying that; the
only option for E: (in the top, drive-select widget) is \\SALMO\WINSTUFF in
the bottom widget. That's not the default -- which is blank -- but the only
available choice. So, I click on it and am told that the drive cannot be
found.

   This is why I think I'm missing something important in the loop. I tried
making a softlink from the old mount point (/mnt/usr2/winstuff) to the new
mount point (/data2/winstuff) but win98 still would not accept it. I don't
know if my missing link is on the win98 side or the linux side. I've changed
/etc/vmware/vmnet1/smb/smb.conf to reflect the proper mount point, stopped
and restarted the virtual machine and still no luck.

   I seem to be spinning my wheels here. Nothing appropriate -- that I've
found -- on the vmware community fora. I'm not sure how to construct a
google seasrch phrase that might provide some answers.

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

I don't understand what you are trying to do with the links.  If you are
trying to mount a Linux directory, use samba to export it.  The your
virtual window box will be able to mount through your windows explorer
using the map drive command.  But links only work in Linux, not window
file systems.

I hate to admit it, but I think I know the answer to this one.  Just
open up the "Network Neighborhood" on the '98 desktop, and browse to the
folder that you want as your E: drive and right click on it.  "Map
Network Drive" should be a little more than 1/2 way down the list. 
Select the drive letter and the check box for reconnecting at login.

Good Luck,

The missing link statement was more of a figure of speech, not an actual 
link/symlink. But you may have answered the question though. Rich, you 
may need to edit /etc/exports to include the linux directories that you 
want to be able to map from the win98 side.

The Intel 536EP modem chipset isn't a good example.  Everything but
voice works, a royal pain if you're trying to use an 536EP chipset
based modem with vgetty.  On my D845PEBT2, the sound doesn't work
under Linux.  I believes there's a driver you can buy, but trying
it under Redhat 9 with Redhat 9's Chromium it didn't work too well.
You shouldn't have to buy a driver if Intel supports Linux.  Then
again, if a foundation paid Intel a fair price to write an OSS
driver that would be reasonable.

As far as patent violations, that has reached a ridiculous level.
As long as you don't use hardware schematics to actually 
produce the thing, or derive something similar, in competition 
with the comnpany that owns it, patent violation shouldn't be 
an issue.  Maybe the answer is to ban patents.

DELL is dishonest just like a number of manufacturers.  I researched
the Dell I bought recently only to find that it wasn't the computer
I had looked up at all.  They reuse product numbers so that it's
or at least vary individual components around a standard design 
making it very hard indeed to do accurate Linux compatibility 
research.  Worse, Dell abandoned it's Linux laptop line.  IBM has
the same bad attitude when it comes to buying a Linux compatible
ThinkPad.  Sadly, you're on your own unless you're a very big 
company.

There needs to be mass reform in the computer industry.  It's
hard to shop for Linux hardware because there is inadequate
labeling and the current legal system does not encourage
hardware manufacturers to be helpful enough.  Why does
patent law have to be so destructive to innovation?

Ken,

   OK, now I think I'm on the right trail. I have the proper path in
/etc/vmwaer/vmnet1/smb/smb.conf. I assume that for whatever reason, samba is
not running so this is not seen by the guest OS in vmware.

   Well, I thought that I had restored samba from the backup but I had not.
Thank you, Ken.

   Now I need to reset the samba passwords (for some reason the old one no
longer works), then deal with the XFree DCA issue: it's apparently not
supported by X.org.

Perhaps if you're of the impression that one size *can* fit all.
Personally, Linux will never leave my PowerBook because I prefer to be
in control of my own computing destiny. I don't appreciate being at
Apple's mercy for security and bugfix upgrades. I don't appreciate it
when Software Update decides it knows better than I what certain
directory permissions ought to be. And I don't appreciate knowing that
my entire computing experience is more or less dictated by one entity
("sorry, that information is divulged strictly on a need-to-know basis,
and we don't think you need to know"). There's also the very distinct
benefit of having a much more responsive laptop (good riddance, spinning
beach-ball of death) that gets better battery life than under OS X. Free
Software ru13z!

I realize that OS hacking isn't for everyone, but some of us actually
enjoy knowing how everything works on the inside. It's a small price to
pay for computing self-determination.

Dan Young had some kind of snazzy new mac laptop at the clinic last
weekend on which he had some debian-based distribution (some african
word I can't remember) installed and he reported not hurting, in fact
"just working" IIRC.  I know I have at least one of those details
wrong, but I am pretty sure it is the name of the distributon, which I
can't recall correctly right now.  Whether I have more things wrong is
an open question.  E.g., it was snazzy, but was it a mac?  I think so.

I've messed with it a bit. The Standalone calendar, Sunbird is not quite 
ready for prime time. In my case, the week of the year is displayed 
along the left edge, but the day of the month can't been seen. There are 
extensions for Thunderbird (mail client), and Firefox. The Firefox 
extension works fine, but the Thunderbird extension looks the same as 
Sunbird. All of them have the ability to be shared if you have a remote 
calendar to subscribe to. As I don't know of any remote calendars, and 
my employer hasn't come up with a better solution, I use my Yahoo 
calendar for sharing my schedule, etc.

   I think that I broke something in my ssh setup when I migrated to the new
distribution. The ~/.ssh/known_hosts file on the system has only my
notebook. As a matter of fact, I sync'd the two so that all the files on the
workstation are copied to the notebook.

   But, when I ssh from the notebook to the workstation I'm no longer asked
for my passphrase, only my password. Do I need to run key-gen again and make
sure that the keys and passwords are the same on both boxes?

Thanks,

Rich

Not sure if this has been addressed here before and a yea or nay is great
as I can search the archives later today.

   I'm looking for more information on SATA -- kind of a "SATA for
Managers" thingy.  As some background I just purchased a SATA card and two
drives based on speed claims.  (No, I'm not interested in any lake front
property :-)  Now I need to determine which SATA options I should
enable/use particulary as this relates to using the SATA or legacy power
connections.  My drives came with both.  SATA requires a new PS, legacy
doesn't.

The most recent kernel sources apparently do not have
it because of a dispute with the kernel maintainers. I
thought it wise to obtain a Webcam based on a
controller whose support is not in dispute. I came
across the AuraCam DC-31U, which uses the widely-used
and supported STV680 controller.

A Fedora problem which is unique, however, is the lack
of FireWire support. I imagine the Fedora project is
trying to overcome this, for in this respect Fedora's
hardware support is substandard.

These links showed up on a shell scripting list yesterday and today:

http://www.moongroup.com/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=29&Itemid=2

(They're different.)  The first one details--after a long historical
introduction that you might as well skip--some IP problems facing the
MARIN project, which involves an MTA authorization mechanism in DNS, as
you may know.  The idea is aimed at checking the spread of worms, virii
and spam, among other things.

The second link follows up the first to state the demise of MARIN. 
Apparently, Microsoft rushed out and filed a patent covering some of the
core functionality that MARIN was to implement, and the technologists
involved could not accept the notion of M$ owning an Internet-wide
solution (those insolent open-standards proponents!).  Once again, it
seems, software patents take their toll on the progress of
technological.

If SSH is only asking for a password again then the conf file on the
SSHD server is defaulting to that.  You will need to move the files
over but I don't know if you will need to recreate the unique files.

Look at the sshd_confif file and for a setting called:
Rhost....
RSSA*
UseLogin
PasswordAuthenication

I forget the details but they are documented well.  I'm guessing that
this new system defaulted to password.

I have to say.  With all the traffic you have generated from one
Distro to another it sure shows how difficult it is to switch and thus
how different each Linux distro really has become.

Indeed.  And for that matter, why run Linux on a Sun, SGI, PA-RISC,
NUMA-Q or iSeries?  Obviously, there are a lot of wrong-headed people

I don't understand the motivation here.  iBooks come with a *fine*
*usable* version of Unix already.  All you'll be doing is creating
yourself a world of hurt.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have used Linux on my Desktop Mac & a really, really old laptop & it ran perfectly. 
Less problems with install/setup/operation compared to the PC laptop I had. 

No world of hurt here...

I know it seems a little unusual seeing as though it does come with a great UNIX system already there, but I know Linux, 
I like to be in control of my comptuer (I think this has already been mentioned) & Yellow Dog runs like a dream on an iBook too!

Good to see some other Mac/Linux Users out there....I sometimes fear I am the only one.

Ken,

   All the former UID/GID have been corrected. I think it is in sshd.config.
I'll check when I return.

Josh,

   I do believe you're correct. It's another detail to be cleaned up in the
Red Hat-7.3->Slackware-10.0 migration. Thousands of little details to
be cleaned! I trip over them all the time. Eventually, .... Maybe. :-)

Many thanks. I'll fix this upon my return.

OS X v.s. Yellowdog is an interesting question.

Both are good, but it really depends on what you want to run.  Since there 
are programs on Yellowdog to run OS X programs, it cover the best of both 
worlds.

I have found a number of programs that do not build well on OS X or 
require X.  If using X was transparent to the user, then it would not be a 
choice.  I found using anything involving X on OS X to be a pain.  
Possible, but not something "one click".

Perl apps, for the most part, built fine on OS X.  (Except for the things 
that expected you to be on a PC.)  A number of things are still kind of 
bjorken on OS X though.  Kerberos and ldap, for example.

Either one is better than Windows, however.

You may have to add execute permission for other to your home and .ssh2 
directories.  The ssh daemon is still root while it tries to read your
key.  Does not change you the user until after the key is checked.

The answer to your explicit question, running ssh-keygen again, is no.
The keys don't know when you change hardware, nor do they know when you
change IP addresses.

Your implicit question, "how do I get this working" is more difficult.
Start off with using "-v" on your client. The verbose messages are *very*
useful for figuring out what is up. Did you copy over your personal keys?
Did you replace or move your host keys? If the IP addresses changed, did
you tell it about that?

Irrelevant. A number of network programs like UIDs to be lined up;
however, SSH is not one of them. If UIDs change SSH doesn't care in the
slightest (as long as the files still belong to the right person).

Well I just had to chime in on this one.  At the school district I work 
for we use a lot of Mac's.  As a matter of fact the mail server I just 
replaced was a Mac G5 running OS-X 10.3 server and it had more problems 
than one would have thought  a Mac would have.  First off there was a 
process that would run wild and unless caught in time it would hang the 
machine.  Secondly, it would randomly corrupt users mail boxes, and 
twice it corrupted the disk.  Also the mail lists never worked.  We had 
only had this Mac server in place since February of this year and we 
decided it had to go so we replaced it with a Pentium IV running 
Fedora.  We contacted Apple about the problems we were having and their 
initial response was "We don't know anybody who is using OS-X for a mail 
server, and then they told us that they would fix the problems 
eventually."  I found this to be a rather pathetic response from a 
company like Apple that has such a good reputation.  I would expect this 
from some other company in Washington but not Apple.  Now the really sad 
part is the OS-X was using the exact same packages we are now running on 
our new mail server.  My best guess is that Apple tweaked the packages 
and just screwed something up in doing so and sadly didn't seem to care 
enough to fix them.

Right!

I'm late to the party here. It was Ubuntu (Ooh-boon-too?) I had at the 
clinic, which is a neat project doing time-based releases of a Debian 
derivative. They're shipping GNOME 2.8 and some of the freedesktop.org 
bits (dbus/hal/etc).

Debian et al aren't my bag, but it's neat and previews some cool stuff 
coming to a desktop near you.

Here's how I fix that:

There.  3952 "will build on OSX" packages.  I challenge you to name
something that isn't in there.

  $ which xterm
  /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm
  $

I seem to have X running just fine.

Maybe you're unaware that:

        1) apple has supported X11 for some time now
        2) fink and opendarwin have been porting all popular software

Second-hand.  The problem is that first, you lose compatibility with a
*lot* of good Mac software out there for *no* reason (because you can
still run X11 alongside Aqua and get the best of both worlds).  And
second, it's very unlikely that Linux can support the exotic Mac
hardware as well as Apple-provided stuff supports it.

Absolutely not.  I'm dead serious.  I'm very confused by anyone who
would want to take the extremely well designed Apple OSX, which has
Aqua *and* X11, and can compile anything that can run on a Linux box
as well as run Mac-only software, and replace it with something that
will effectively cripple the box.

Hi,

I have a Fedora Core 2 box and am about to get a DSL connection.  Before I 
hook up, I'd like to increase my security.  Can anyone recommend a good 
Linux Security Quickstart for Dummies?  I don't know anything about 
networking, how to close ports, set up a firewall, etc.

Thanks,
jatzger

1) Fedora Core 2 offers to set up firewalling as part of the setup.  Accept the offer.
2) as root on your new FC2 box run `chkconfig --list | grep on`  That will give you a 
   list of running services.  Figure out what you don't need and shut them down with
   chkconfig --del <unneeded service> && /etc/init.d/<unneeded service> stop
3) Bastille will walk you through the process of security hardening your box while
   teaching you about the issues.  You can learn more and get a copy at
   http://www.bastille-linux.org/

After you've done the above remember that we're always here.

Having said all that, a firewall or an operating firewall on your box  is the #1
line of protection.   Remember to control what goes out as well what comes in.

I already have FC2 installed and I've a lot of stuff already on the box.  I 
would rather not reinstall.  I don't remember if I selected that option.  Is 
there a way I can check to see if a firewall is running and install one if 
it's not?

Thanks for the other tips.  I'll use them.

Thanks,

Item #2 about `chkconfig ...` and look specifically for iptables.
  and
as root `/sbin/iptables -L`  will show you what rules are in effect.

I think you can run system-config-firewall or something like that.
I don't have an FC2 system in front of me right now so I can say for
sure, so try this command:

   rpm -qa | grep firewall

That will turn up the package name. I think the script name
is the same.

That doesn't work.  You can work through the menu system 
  System Settings -> Security Level 

and the GUI applet will let you reconfigure the firewall.

While you're mucking about in there
  System Settings -> Server Settings -> Services 
is a GUI config replacement for the chkconfig commands I suggested earlier.
You may be more comfortable with that, and it's a "click on or off" way
to go through all of the available services on your system.

Run /usr/bin/system-config-securitylevel (or its CLI counterpart, 
/usr/bin/system-config-securitylevel-tui). That'll give you the 
firewall dialog you see during the installation process.

Are you plugging the drive into a SATA backpanel?  If no, then you
are using legacy power.

http://www.serialattachedscsi.com/aboutscsi/sas/tutorials/SAS_General_overview_public.pdf

This document covers SAS but also details SATA as it relates to SAS.
page 26 shows the above difference.

After page 31 the document get a little deep for most.

IIRC (from the Taroon-list mail list), it is better to use 'chkconfig 
<unneeded service> off'
than to use '--del'.  The stated reason was that after an upgrade, a 
"deleted" service would
be re-enabled, but the "off" setting would be honored and the would not 
re-enable the
undesired daemon(s).

You're assuming anyone who might run Linux on their Apple hardware does
so for the applications, rather than the system itself. Speaking only
for myself, that's definitely *not* the case. On the rare occasion I
have the need to use a MacOS-based app, I can either re-boot into OS X
natively, or run it under MOL ("Mac-On-Linux", which "boots" a
full-blown OS X system within a window on your X11 desktop).

There's nothing exotic about Mac hardware (unless you work for Apple
marketing). It's beautifully designed, but the insides are pretty
common.

Just for the record, Linux does *not* "effectively cripple" Apple
hardware. There are some video-related issues with the later laptops,
but those are farily minor and related to the closed-source
proprietary nature of the video chipset world.

Both my Macs now run Linux full-time. I wouldn't have made that choice
if I had thought it would cripple my computers. My old desktop PowerMac
is far and away more useful with Linux than MacOS. Hell, it won't even
run any MacOS newer than OS 9. It happily purrs away on a Linux 2.6
kernel, doing yeoman's duty as my home server. My PowerBook is faster,
gets better battery life, and is easier to configure and maintain the
way *I* want it to be with Linux. (And no, fink doesn't cut it. It's
sufficient if you're stuck on OS X, but it's no replacement for a
full-blown Debian Linux install.)

In the end, this is just another pointless debate. Run whatever you
like!

One complaint I have about MacOSX and Windows XP too is that these
systems have embedded drivers in them potentially that are specific 
to the machine they are installed to.  My brother's sunflower computer
won't run the APC USP signalling software because powerchute
requires MacOSX 10.2 or newer and he only has 10.1.  I've seen bug's
life lock up randomly and when he still had spiderman, it noticeably
had problems too.  It's confusing to me that Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X
10.1 are installed to the system.  My other brother's iBook though
with Mac OS X 10.3 is nice because it has cups and can print
to my pc only HP LaserJet 6P printer.  I'd buy a postfix module
for it, but I've never been able to find one at the right price.

You need to go back to the Unix basics class. Think about the
implications of what you said...   Changing the permissions is absolutely
unneeded.

If you then go and read about security, and in particular SSH; you'll
learn that having the .ssh directories be only readable/executable by you
IS THE STANDARD CONFIGURATION AS OTHERWISE IT IS NOT SECURE!!!

I disagree.  OpenSSH is very secure if the ~/.ssh permissions are incorrect.
It refuses to run.

Message-ID: <20040923150318.A4949@defiant.ncplus.net>

Howdy!

I just setup a dual boot on a Sony VAIO (WinXPpro/FC2) for a friend.
He uses quickbooks in his business, so win is still a requirement
until I figger out how to move him to an open source solution. Anyhow,
the real Q is how to get it to Hibernate. The win OS hibernates just
fine, and boots up quickly as a result. The FC2 just takes a long
time, which is _not_ gonna sell him on moving to it completely.

I know that several of you had these machines when I was regularly
attending meetings down there, so I'm assuming that somebody knows the
secret to getting this to work. And I'd really appreciate some
pointers!

Thanx!,

Please notice that I did not say to open the permissions anymore than to
let the ssh daemon running as root see the keys it needs to see.  Do not
add other's read or write permissions to the home directory.  I root
cannot read your keys you will never get logged in with them.

Hi everyone.  I'm new here so be nice to me :)  Some day I'll walk
down the street after work and visit one of your gatherings.

I also run Linux on an Apple ibook and find it be my favorite
workstation to date.  It runs as well as the day I bought it almost 3
years ago and am hoping for at least three more.  I started out using
YellowDog but evolved to Debian at the same time that I ditched Redhat
for Debian on the x86 last year.  I keep up to date on my kernels
(2.6.8.1) and run Debian unstable(oooh, on the edge).  My 2 cents are
that MacOSX is a great piece of software but it doesn't compare to
Linux even in the slightest.  I love that MacOSX uses apache and samba
its really a great way to implement Open Source software but its just
not good enough.  As far as compatibility goes... I have no problem
even in the slightest. Every piece of hardware works extremely well. 
My ibook is so durable its practically bullet proof.  Its taken way
more spills than I will ever admit.

The problems :(
Macromedia will not make flash plugins for Linux running on a PPC
processor. This is very very sad.  It unfairly cripples me from
accessing a bunch of cool internet content.  No Java 1.4... another
bummer.

-Brian

I've seen power supplies with SATA power connectors, only 4 wires were
going into it.  Kinda makes you wonder why they bothered with a new
power connector.  Just to match the cuteness of the data connector?

Food for thought,

Also, the GUI (in my experience) has high latency when running on a G3.

to suspend to memory. If you have a kernel compiled to support it and
also hardware which supports it (the only machine I've tried it on, a
desktop machine, apparently doesn't), do the same except for s/mem/disk/
to suspend to disk instead.

Warning: One time I did this, some things didn't act correctly
(e.g. Konqueror would crash when attempting to save a page) until the
machine was rebooted.

"darwinports" deals with that.  Fink has only a few Aqua programs.  I
use fink heavily, and darwinports lightly.

And that's exactly what I am pointing out.  I have a tough enough
time in the real world because I'm not running Windows and Windows IE.

Why would I *aggravate* that by running none of:

        Windows
        Linux on x86
        OSX

which are arguably the three biggest deployed platforms...?

Maybe those of you that are doing this can afford to not get real work
done from time to time.  I can't.  I suppose if I had a "spare"
machine instead of my "main" machine where I have to get Real Work
Done, I could run exotic operating systems on it.

   I have a screen capture that shows the problem if anyone wants to see it.
The file's about 650K in size so I won't post it to the list.

   I have discovered what causes this, but not why: it's a function of the
window decoration in Xfce. As I test various decorative schemes the squares
change size or, with a few designs, disappear completely. In a couple of
cases the squares collapse to narrow, horizontal lines. They aall appear to
be extensions of the corner areas that can be grabbed to resize the window.

   Guess it's time for a message to Olivier about this.

TTFN,

Rich

I would occasionally have trouble similar (though not identical) to 
what you're describing when running Xfce under X using a) an S3 Savage 
with limited video ram and b) the XFree86 S3 driver.

Since installing an ATI card with more memory, the problem has 
disappeared.

Paul,

   Ectually, this is an ATI card with 64M RAM. I've not seen the behavior
before -- on this or other systems -- regardless of xfce version or video
card. That's why it was so surprising.

I once downloaded and installed a flash plugin because I needed it to
use some site or other.  But after that I started seeing some really
annoying flash ads that my animate:once setting had no affect on.
So I uninstalled it.

Hi Again,

My first post & I caused quite the stir *chuckles* Last time that
happened I think I had mentioned I used GNOME as my Desktop Environment.
Anyway I agree about the Macromedia Flash discussion. I would imagine
that it would be an advantage. I can't stand Flash at the best of times.
It's over used too much these days. As for using that particular program
I do run a WINE program so I can use Dreamweaver MX I am not sure if
Macromedia Flash is supported or not, but you could look into it.

OSX vs Yellowdog:  I tend to agree with Randal, about using software
that is popular enough to attract some development.  I did not switch
from BSD to Linux until it looked like there was sufficient development
to permit me to get my work done.  

However, there are good reasons for people to push the less
popular platforms.  It helps keep the developers of the popular
platforms honest.  If OSX has any particular disadvantage that
Yellowdog lacks, the example makes it very difficult for OSX
apologists to claim that the disadvantage is inescapable. 
Successful alternatives spotlight laziness and corruption.  I am
glad there are those with the vision to pursue these alternatives.
(Like Perl, when it was mostly a gleam in Larry Wall's eye ...)

with a love/hate relationship with their Mac:

Some of us actualy enjoy learning about new technology and playing
with new things.  Its not always work to us.  Sure there is a thin
line but being productive 100% of your life isn't that much fun.  And
honestly those that use Linux on Apple hardware don't see a difference
between Linux on x86 and Linux on PPC. Except that PPC runs faster.

The one I'm curious about now is the web jetadmin software.  It is 
bascially a java application and should run on any platform, right?  I 
haven't investigated this yet, but will soon.

If you don't mind installing directly from a tarball on the CPAN, you can go to
http://search.cpan.org/~rclamp/Module-CoreList-1.97/ for that module.

You can use 

  perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> install Module::Corelist

And then keep following the prompts and installing other modules you need.  Yeah, it's tedious,
but it works.

Or better still:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Bricolage'

That installs the modules you need to run Bricolage.  You have to follow a bunch of prompts as it
finds dependencies, but it works.

Keith,

   I'm downloading it now. 42M worth. It comes in two flavors: Red Hat 9 or
SuSE 9.1. I can run the former through rpm2tgz. I'll see how it is.

After using cpan2rpm for a while and getting really aggravated with the
unreadable spec files it generated, I rolled my own.  The spec file uses
Template Toolkit, so it's a much easier to modify.  It also uses
CPANPLUS, which has shown itself to be less of an improvement over CPAN.
pm (for programmability) than I'd hoped.  The dependencies on CPANPLUS
and Template Toolkit can be somewhat hairy, but you can probably grab
the SRPMs from my repository and rebuild them: 

http://haus.nakedape.cc/ftp/nakedape/rhes3/

At the very least, all of the dependencies should be packaged in my
repository.

Unfortunately, it won't really help you unroll the list of dependencies,
since that's not generally available.

I found the only iteration of this that would work was "install

After searching the web, I'm under the impression that the main 
Bricolage program still needs to be compiled and installed after the 
Bundle::Bricolage is installed.

Yes, I believe that's correct.  Bundle::Bricolage is merely a bundle to install the dependencies. 
However, once you can get those installed, installing Bricolage should be much easier.

   I decided it was easier to press the little button on the printer a couple
of thousand times to set IP addresses than to hassle with a huge Red Hat
package for Jet Webadmin.

   The color printer is now a network host and prints just fine.

   I learned a lot from this exercise. Thank you all

There is a Flash player for Linux/PPC, but it mostly sucks.

It's in the 'swf-player' package in the Debian world. In the real world,
it's part of a Flash decoder library that lives on SourceForge:

<http://swfdec.sourceforge.net/>

Description: SWF (Macromedia Flash) player
 A GTK+ and SDL based player for Macromedia Flash animations.  Includes
 a Mozilla plugin, that embeds the player into Mozilla-based browsers,
 in order to allow seamless viewing of Flash animations in web
 pages.  Includes a GdkPixbuf loader, so that SWF animations can be
 used seamlessly as images in Gtk+ applications.

I ended up removing it from my system not so long ago because:
A) It has a tendency to "run away" when loaded as a browser plug-in.
B) Flash animations are, with a few rare exceptions, a scourge upon the
web-browsing populace.

I am also interested in recording online radio

Can someone recommend audio-capture applications for

I'd suggest using WebDAV.  You can setup a server on your Apache
server with Mod_Dav and for clients windows does it natively.  You
just need to have them setup a network location that points at your
server.  They then just copy files to that location.  There are many
webdav clients for all OS's out there.  Web dav can do authenication,
file locking, confirmation uploads and other simple yet useful
features.  No install needed for the clients on windows and there are
free clients for other operating systems.

If you want to use another service or server for file uploads you will
have to pay someone for that.  The hosting of the files.  I'd think
you could just do it on your server and have them remove the files. 
To the clients the change would be small and to you on the apache
server the files would go into the same location.

I use it for transferring files through firewalls a lot.  It works out
will.  It isn't as good as ftp or as fast, but a nice alternative.

Mark,

   I know nothing about debian. However, you will probably be better off
getting the newest version (1.1.2) from their Web site.

If I understand he Subject line of your message, you're running 
Debian. Is that correct?

If so, Debian has its own openoffice packages; I'd use them instead of 
an rpm.

As root, try this:

   apt-get openoffice.org

I'm sure there are lots of opinions here... :-)

I'm putting together a system for my neighbors, and am looking for a
reasonable case/power supply. We were down at Fry's this afternoon
(I know many people don't like them, but I have no problems with
them) and they certainly have a selection of cases. But for the
most part they're geared towards the gamer. Things like see-through
sides, fancy lights, ridiculous molded plastic covers, etc.

All I want is a basic, reasonable mid-tower case, either with no
power supply or at least a 400W supply with QUIET fans. Antec used
to make some nice cases, but the only reasonable one Fry's had was
a full-tower.

So a recommendation on a) a brand/style of case, and b) a source for
same would be greatly appreciated.

I bought an Antec SLK1600 from ENU a few months back. Looks like they
still carry it:

<http://www.enuinc.com/cas-antec-003.html>

It was everything I wanted and nothing more: sturdy; plain (no
blinkenlights or clear panels); easy to work on (very easy to open up);
reasonably priced. It came with with a modest power supply, but no fan.

john,

   I'll second the recommendation of ENU, Inc. I bought a few cases from them
and their advice is always right on the mark. The last one I bought, a few
weeks ago, was only $35 because it came with a rather poor power supply. As
I had a quite new, quality power supply in the system I was replacing this
was an ideal choice for me.

   Tell them what you're building and for what purpose and they'll explain
the trade-offs in available choices.

Yikes!
Brent-
one of the keys along the top row will take you to a setup screen;
I think it's the fourth one (F4). Maybe that'll help. Generally,
I wound up with it connected to a serial port and had a login:
prompt, and went from there.  I never tested it with mgetty, but
I fiddled with the port speeds (in and outbound) and parity / etc
until it worked (on the first box I used; most recently, it just
worked.)

Hang in there :) Surely it's not that flakey. (I knew it was
eccentric, but that's beyond the pale.)

Hmm it also occurs to me that I had "no response" when I turned it on
a few times- but cycling the power generally fixed it. It may have
been in such a state as you describe.

There are two severe flaws with what you're saying. First, as root is
god, it is rather difficult to stop a root from doing whatever it wants
to (the NSA kernel extensions change this, but this is a recent factor).
Even doing `chmod 000` on a file will not stop root from reading it,
because, root is god and can do anything, and root can chmod it to any
other permissions it wants.

Second, sshd does a setuid() prior to accessing the keys. Add a third
factor, unless you're using an odd configuration OpenSSH completely
ignores .ssh2 directories, utilizing only the .ssh directory.

Though allowing others to access the directory in theory won't kill you
it is still a VERY BAD IDEA! I suggest you get better knowledge about
what you're dealing with next time you try to help others.

I generally order parts online when I build a new box, but the one
thing I try to buy locally (because of the weught) is the case.  I've
purchased them at Belmont Computer in close-in SE Portland, and at ENU
out on NE 122nd just north of Sandy.

   I got the LinkSys KVM switch working today and fired up the second box.
Now there is a slight mis-registration of the colors that produces a shadow
or slightly out-of-focus appearance of text on the screen. Not very
pleasant. Is there something I can do to restore this?

   Also, after firing up the second box I see the caps lock light on. Turns
out that that key switches between the two machines in addition to using the
button on the switch box. Any way to turn that key off?

Thanks,

Dude.  Run whatever the heck you want to run.  If you wanna run

it ain't nobody's business if you do.

But you don't gotta tell everyone else what they want to run, even if

   My new(est) box was booted before I plugged in the cat5 network cable.
Then I plugged it in and saw a reflection of the green lcd inside the card.
So it looks from both ends (the other end being the switch) that the
connection is electrically alive.

   However, I cannot bring up the interface. I ran 'ifconfig eth0 up' and was
informed that there is no such interface. So I ran '/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1',
then re-ran ifconfig. Still no eth0. Running ethtool confirms that the
system cannot find the card.

   Suggestions on how I can trace to the source of the problem? It may be
obvious, but not to me this late on a Friday.

Many thanks,

By the subject line, I'm going to assume you're using Debian.  Instead
of futzing around with the (mostly broken, even in the RPM world) rpm
system, just apt-get install openoffice.org instead...

Sounds to me like you don't have drivers loaded for your card. Do lspci
to figure out what the card is and then load the appropriate module.

Evan,

   Of course! I forgot that the NIC is built into the motherboard on that
box. If I could cut-and-paste between machines on the same monitor I'd be
able to look for the proper driver in google. It's a broadcom, but also
mentions DEC tulip. However, the tulip driver didn't want to load.

   Tomorrow I'll post the specific lines from lspci and we'll go from there.

Thanks very much,

Rich

I'm not sure I understand your question.  But if you're running
Debian, you can install Debian's version OpenOffice from the 'net
using apt-get, dselect, synaptic or whatever.  
To do it with apt-get, you'd open up a terminal, become root (with the
'su' command) and then install OpenOffice with:
  apt-get install openoffice.org
And then wait a looong time for the package to download from the net.

Or you could apt-get install the 'alien' command and use that to
convert the RPM file to a Debian package.  But that's something folks
do only when the package isn't in Debian already.

Or you could download the OpenOffice tarball from the OO website and
install it that way.  But it's better to use a package for Debian so
your system can keep track of it and upgrade or uninstall it when
necessary.

HTH,
  Aaron

I think you've already hit upon the best solution.  It's well-known
tech that's simple to implement on both ends and about as firewall-
friendly as you can get.  I can't imagine it'd be hard to write a li'l
proggie that sits on the user's PC and does the upload, but as it is,
the end user can do it with pretty much any web browser, including,
say, one running in a bootable Knoppix CD.

Unfortunately, just better VGA cables, better KVM or a lower-frequency
video refresh rate.  If you're running 85 Hz, go down to 72 or 70.
One reason I like the Belkin SOHO KVMs is that they come with really
good cables.

Ida know.  The manual and online support don't say?  Definitely
something to pester Linksys about.  The color thing, too.

Actually, I have since installed Firefox's Adblock extension, which
can hide flash as well as images.  So I could turn flash back on.
But I still don't like flash.  At best, I think that it's eye candy,
useless fluff added to a page to add jazziness.  And if you actually
need it to navigate the site, then it's even worse, because I've 
reached the point where I have to blow the fonts up before I can
read them, and you can't do that to flash.  And anyone who
is truly blind is SOL with it.

I have never had occasion to do this.  Can you describe to me what the

Are there examples online where I could see what it looks like?

I remembered that f3 enters the terminal setup to twiddle the port 
speeds, parity, terminal type, etc.  I also found a handy set of 
documents at http://vt100.net/docs/, if other people are reliving their 
youth with 20+ year old terminals they might find something useful there 
too.

As it turns out it was a problem with mgetty, or at least a problem with 
how I configured mgetty.  When I switched to agetty it worked as 
expected - I'm playing angband on it now!

It could be divided into smaller pieces using "split" or a similar

Sometimes you want to easily view Flash, like
http://homestarrunner.com/, but for the rest of it there's FlashBlock,
http://flashblock.mozdev.org/, which let's you easy run the Flash
content you want and block the rest.

I found out a good way to do this, grab the latest version from the internet in a gzip format.  this way you dont mess with the rpms, and packages will install with tools that are in every build.

Unfair blow.  If it was a Perl question, I *might* be able to invoke
some authority, and usually I don't.

But otherwise, I am just *a user*.  A happy powerbook user for the
last 12 years (from the Powerbook 140 to my 15-inch AlBook today).
With a strong opinion based on that sort of usage, even when it was
difficult because of incompatibility.

I'm hurt by your invocation of "Famous Expert".  Back off, man.  Or
get some therapy yourself for confusing strong opinions with demands.

Adzapper gets those hyper-annoying MP3 ads, along with the various
javascript popups, ad banners and flash ads.

I agree.  There's really nothing that Flash offers that can't be done
better with W3C javascript, graphics, sound or a real movie format.

Aaron,

   Thanks. I assume that LinkSys uses good quality cables and the monitor is
running at 75 Hz. What's funny is that this morning the shift's gone away
again. I suspect it may be a lag when shifting from one machine to the other
and after awhile the colors drift back into registration.

   I don't yet know how often I'll be switching between the two. I suspect
that it will not be frequently.

   Bought on eBay; no manual. This is a discontinued model so I doubt LinkSys
cares at all. I'll check google, however.

   Thanks very much.

Ken,

   And they're also for gigabit networks, which I do not have.

   There's also a DECchip 21140 for FasterNet onboard. I uncommented that
line in /etc/rc.d/rc.modules, ran '/sbin/modprobe tulip' and followed that
with 'ifconfig eth0 up'. This works. I show eth0 as UP and RUNNING. However,
... the "network is unreachable".

   So, I run 'route' and see there's only lo listed. Then I ran,
'route add -net 192.168.55.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.55.4 eth0'

but, instead of seeing that route in the kernel routing table, I get the
response that the "network is unreachable". I must be a bit slow this
morning because I thought that adding the route would make the network
reachable. What have I missed, please?

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

What does ifconfig give you?
Can it ping itself?
Got the cable in the right hole?
Unreachable usually means your on the wrong subnet or you have the wrong
route.

Thanks Rich,

I should have stated that I already have done some research. 
Thanks for the suggestion though as I did not check this one.
I was hoping that someone had bought one and installed Linux 
on it. I have seen different distro's on Toshiba's and they 
all work fine.

Just wanting some local input.

Thanks,

Dale

Hi all,

I have a Samsung Digimax 430 digital camera and I want to download the pics from it.  It was no
problem on Windows, but my Fedora Core 2 system seems to be having problems.

I've hooked it up to the computer using a USB cable and made sure the camera was on.  Running
"gphoto2 --list-ports" shows a usb port, but "gphoto2 --auto-detect" comes up empty-handed --
though to be fair, my camera is not listed as supported.  And yes, the camera was plugged into the
USB port and turned on.

Any suggestions?

Cheers,
Ovid

Rich,

They do 10/100/1000.  Ethtool is used to setup the NIC after the module
is loaded.

I don't have that particular model, but I do have Fedora Core 1
installed on my Toshiba A15-S127 that I bought a little over a year
ago.  I haven't had any problems with it.
Try it and if it doesn't work then take it back.

Ken,

   How strange! ifconfig does not show the IP address, netmask or broadcast
addresses. Wait, ...

   Hokay. I just re-ran /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 (while the interface is up) and
that re-read rc.inet1.conf so it picked up the IP addresses. I _thought_ I
had re-run the network configurator a couple of times before.

   Well, now it's working so I'll return you to your regularly scheduled
Saturday as I gather a truckload of stuff to take to Free Geek.

Many thanks, Ken!

Dale,

   I know nothing about that Toshiba model. But, I've run Red Hat on a
Toshiba Libretto and both Red Hat 7.3 and Slackware 8.1, 9.0, 9.1 and 10.0
on my Toshiba Portege CT-3025. I never tried sound on either one so I cannot
commnet on that. Otherwise, linux installed very easily on both boxes.

HTH,

Rich

Plug it in and turn it on, then run dmesg (or otherwise look at the end of
/var/log/messages) and see if it says anything about usb, or possibly scsi.

I see the following:

  Initializing USB Mass Storage driver...
  usbcore: registered new driver usb-storage
  USB Mass Storage support registered.
  ohci_hcd: 2004 Feb 02 USB 1.1 'Open' Host Controller (OHCI) Driver (PCI)
  ohci_hcd: block sizes: ed 64 td 64
  loop: loaded (max 8 devices)

However, I saw that both before and after I turned on the camera.  Since I was messing around
quite a bit with this, I wonder if I did something earlier that would lead to this.  I also see
the following at the end of /var/log/messages:

  Sep 25 10:43:04 tomis bonobo-activation-server (ovid-17015): iid OAFIID:BrokenNoType:20000808

  Sep 25 10:45:06 tomis su(pam_unix)[17038]: session opened for user root by (uid=500)

Those timestamps are roughly when I tried to start the camera.

Ovid

I use an HP 735. In the USB setup menu, I have the choice of "Digital 
Camera" or "Disk Drive". For Windoze systems, it needs to be set to 
Digital camera, and for Linux systems disk drive. Does your camera have 
that capability? You then need to mount the "disk drive" before you can 
access it.

Hello!

I have been using Linux with my digital camera for about 2 
years now and have had nothing but problems with the gphoto 
way of doing things. I should mention that I have not tried 
this for some time and it may work now, but I do not seem to 
need it.

I bought a CompactFlash - reader and put the disk into it and 
the files show up on /mnt/removable.

I then transfer them to my Pictures directory and use a 
program called dcraw to change them from raw format to .ppm.
These can be viewed using konqueror. I then use 
convert file.ppm  file.jpg
if I want them in .jpg format and go from there.

ImageMagick and The Gimp are the way to go.

Hope this is helpful.

I've searched through the menus and I can't seem to find anything like that.  The closest thing I
see is a USB setting that lets me select "Computer" or "Printer."  I suspect that is not what I
want.  Searching through the manual doesn't reveal anything, either.

I tried reading through the manual, but it turns out it's in Spanish! Heh :)

Hmmm, I wonder if your camera is not reporting itself correctly.  I would
have hoped that it would report itself as a block device that the kernel
could load a driver for.  You can try catting out /proc/bus/usb/devices
to see if a recognizable device showed up.  But if the camera won't play
fair, then I think that you will have to go the route of pulling the 
memory and sticking it in a reader.  (or go back to windows)

Windows?  Grumble, grumble.

I do have a Windows 2000 partition.  From grub.conf:

  title Windows 2000
        rootnoverify (hd0,2)
        chainloader +1

My images are already loaded there.  Is there anyway I can mount the Windows partition from within
Linux to pull those images over?

Ovid

I am using Fedora Core 2 with a USB Kodak camera. I plugged the USB
cable into my camera, turned it on, opened gThumb Image Viewer,
File/Import Photos from the menu. gThumb found my camera and imported
the pictures.

Yes - mount the Windows partition... /dev/hda3 if my guess is correct.

It's Win2K, so may or may not be NTFS.  If it's NTFS, you'll need to
make sure you have the NTFS module loaded.  If it's FAT32 (your other
option), you're probably okay, most everybody has that driver available
in stock kernels.

mkdir /mnt/winblows
mount /dev/hda3 /mnt/winblows

Sure you can. My /etc/fstab has:

/dev/hda2            /windows/C           ntfs 
ro,users,gid=users,umask=0002,nls=iso8859-1 0 0

users,gid=users,umask=0002,iocharset=iso8859-1,code=437 0 0


   You would just have to make the appropriate entry(s) for your distro 
and partition, then mount it. Adjust permissions possibly, ....

[root at tomis ovid]# mount /dev/hda3 /mnt/windows/
mount: fs type ntfs not supported by kernel

How do I load the ntfs module?  "modprobe ntfs" returns "Module ntfs not found."

I tried to install kernel-ntfs-2.6.5-1.358.i686.rpm from
http://linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net/rpm/fedora2.html, but it says that while I have the correct
kernel, it's not running.  My version is actually 2.6.5-1.358.8kstacks (due to needing that with
an NVIDIA driver) and I think that's the problem.  NVIDIA has released drivers for 4K stacks, but
I've been afraid to install them lest I break something.  FC2 has a somewhat different
architecture than RH, so I've been leery of making too many changes.

Cheers,
Ovid

How do you access it from Windows?  Digital cameras can either act like 
USB disk drives, or have a proprietary protocol.  gphoto talks the 
various proprietary protocols.  If yours is a newer camera, then it 
probably supports mounting as a disk drive.  My camera works just fine 
with FC2 as a disk drive and not with gphoto.

First thinking is to check if the computer sees the camera as a USB 
device.  'lsusb' in the usbutils package is useful for this.  Also, look 
in /var/log/messages to see if it is being recognized, and if 
usb-storage module is loading.

Next, try mounting the filesystem.  Usually, it will show up as 
/dev/sda1.  Try "mount /dev/sda1 /mnt".  If this works, you might want 
to make a more permanent directory and add it to fstab.

The 8kstacks kernel is incompatible with the prebuilt kernel-ntfs module 
since it was made for the default Fedora kernel (with 4kstacks).

You could build your own NTFS module.  The instructions at 
linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net don't work for 2.6 kernels.

   I just brought two large storage containers of boards, drives and cables
to Free Geek. That's almost 20 years of accumulated parts and pieces. In
addition to the space I gained I found my old HP-67 which has been missing
for years and a few other things that should never have been in the computer
parts containers.

   The Tandy 102 laptop, however, goes on eBay this weekend.

   I read on the firefox Web site how easy it is to install an extension.
"Just click on the 'install' button, shut down the application and restart".
Hah! Fat chance.

   Trying to install the adblock plugin, I click on the 'install' button. The
progress bar widget in the lower, right corner speeds along, but ... there's
nothing there. I cannot 'find' an adblock*xpi on the hard drive. It's not
listed as an extension when I look on the tools menu.

   I must be missing something very simple again, but I cannot see what it
is. A pointer would be very helpful.

   I just upgraded from x.org-6.7 to -6.8.0 to see if it would allow VMware
to go into full-screen mode. When I tried to startx the server load failed
because it could not find the core keyboard module. That's confirmed by
/var/log/X.org.

   However, the core keyboard module section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf has not
changed from the prior version and that section is still there. I don't see
why the error was generated. I can post the pertinent segments of the conf
and log files if that would help.

   Fixed it. In /etc/X11/xorg.conf there is the core keyboard section. In
there I had:

 	Identifier "mini-keybd"
 	Device	   "Keyboard"

and this worked just fine with 6.7.0. However, since the driver is named
keyboard.o.gz, I changed the initial uppercase 'K' to a lowercase 'k' and
6.8.0 became contented. Sigh. PITA. But, what the heck. If the X server is
happy, I'm happpy.

TTFN,

   I ran 'mksmbpassword.sh' to copy /etc/shadow to /etc/samba/ in a form that

seem to find a password it likes.

   If you have experience with winduhs networking with samba, please contact

Firefox has a Preferences setting regarding "let web sites install
software" (or something similar) that must be selected in order for
XPI packages to install automatically. That'd be the first thing I'd
check.

Also, I don't think the .xpi file itself ever gets placed on disk (at
least not somewhere the average user would look).

In your preferences, make sure that you have 'Allow websites to install sw'
checked.  You can turn it off again once you've got the extension.  (It's 
also safe to leave it checked.  Firefox will not install any software
without asking you first.)

Also, most extensions will only install themselves when Firefox starts up.
Which means that you have to close all of its windows first.

Mel,

   Since I don't know what existing password the virtual win98 is seeking, I
su'd to root then ran 'smbpasswd rshepard'. I entered a password twice, then
fired up VMware and tried mapping the drive. When asked for a password I
entered the new one. It still didn't like it.

   Good suggestion, got any more?

Many thanks,

Rich

   In case anyone else cares, X.org-6.8.0 fixes the full-screen problem with
VMware-4.5.2.

What security mode is your samba server running in? What file is listed
as your smb passwd file? What share are you trying to mount? Does that
share exist in smb.conf? What config information do you have for that
share in smb.conf?

If the only purpose of this Samba server is to transfer files to your
virtual machine, you chould just make a public share with no password.

Or use WebDav, or use FTP, or use SCP... IMHO, the samba sharing stuff
is a PITA and not worth the hassle.

One of my early tasks at my new job is to try and replace our Exchange

(or Open xchange) but I recently discovered Communigate Pro.  I like
the fact it uses text based data files and keeps mails in a standard
unix format and files in standard directories.  I don't get all the
fancy groupware stuff (forum, knowledge base, etc) that we don't use
anyway. And they seem to really care about a good Outlook integration
experience.  
Any thoughts or experiences about this software?

   Do you refer to permissions? At what do I look to determine the security

   /etc/samba/smbpasswd. It had permissions 600 which I just changed to 666
... nope. Makes no difference.

   On the linux side it's /data2/winstuff. On the virtual win98 side it's
\\salmo\winstuff. In /etc/samba/smb.conf the last stanza reads:

; share name -- modified by RBS 2004-09-22
[winstuff]
    comment = Shared directory for group vmwin98
    path = /data2/winstuff
    writable = yes
    valid users  = @vmwin98
    locking = yes
    create mode = 0660
    directory mode = 0770

   Yes; see above.

   See above.

   I don't care what flavor share it is. I need a way to get geospatial data
into the virtual machine for analyses and mapping with MapInfo and I need a
way of getting product back out to the linux side. I don't recall having to
use a password before, but this was set up in 1998 or so and not needed to
be attended to since. My synaptic connections on what was done then have
deteriorated into connections of what I had for dinner last evening. If it's
easy to reconfigure the virtual machine and samba for a public share, I'll
be happy to do it. I just want it to work.

Many thanks,

Rich

It seems like there are a lot of people having problems working around
binary-distributed kernels.....

It may be worthwhile for everybody to take some time and learn about
compiling your own kernel.  It can provide you with better performance,
more stability, and fewer compatibility woes such as those mentioned in
this thread.  It's also a learning experience; you really get to know
how well supported your hardware is in the kernel and what other
hardware is supported.

Ovid,

Granted my Coolpix 995 is listed as supported on Fedora Core 2 but I 
thought I'd tell you what I've been doing to see if it works for you.
I start with my camera turned off, plug it into the USB and turn it 
on... wait a few seconds then as root run:
# mount /udev/sda1 /mnt/camera/

then move the files to an existing folder with:
# mv -v /mnt/camera/dcim/101nikon/*.jpg /home/david/photos/photos2004/

Then unmount the camera:
# umount /mnt/camera/
Turn off camera and unplug from USB

Then run GQView a great photo viewer that's preloaded on FC 2 (hint you 
can delete a photo with the delete button or edit it with the Gimp by 
right clicking on the photo and selecting "edit ... with the Gimp")
# gqview /home/david/photos/photos2004/

Of course once I got all that working I set it up in my .bashrc file to 
run the lot of em as one command. It's pretty sweet to plug in my 
camera, hit a couple keys and then be going through a slideshow of 
photos editing and deleting them as I go.

The only problem with this script is that the photos end up being owned 
by root, so I've got an additonal step that resets them.

Hope that helps,

David

Rob,

   Allow me to add to your words of wisdom. It's easy and fool-proof. The
instructions on the Kernel-building-HOWTO (a google search will take you to
it) are sufficiently accurate. There are only a few steps:

   1.) Untar the source in /usr/src/2.x.x/.

   2.) cd to that directory and run 'make config', 'make menuconfig' or 'make
xconfig'. The former gives you all choices one at a time in sequential
order. The second (my favorite) uses a ncurses text interface that makes it
very easy to see what you're doing and move around during configuration.
Help is as close as the '?' key. The third is a GUI interface. Save the
configuration.

   3.) Run, in order:
 	make dep;
 	make clean;
 	make bzImage;
 	make modules;
 	make modules_install;

   4.) Copy appropriate files from the source directory to /boot (the HOWTO
specifies which ones).

   5.) Rebuild links in /boot

   6.) Add a stanza for your new kernel in /etc/lilo.conf or
/boot/grub/grub.conf. Run '/sbin/lilo' if that's your loader.

   7.) Take your new kernel for a test drive. If it goes off the road for any
reason, reboot and select the former kernel that you know boots. Fix the new
one and repeat steps 6 and 7.

It mentions using high quality cables for optimum video display.
also it mentions IBM Thinkpad and Toshiba laptops by name as being extra
sensitive to mouse/keyboard configurations. It says to not connect one or the
other when using the KVM to switch between other machines and these laptops.
Meaning only the mouse or keyboard for the laptops.

mentions disabling powersaving features, as it may cause the keyboard and mouse
to become useless when the machine goes into sleep mode.

to use cables shorter than 6 feet i length as it may cause screen distortion, as

   From my Web research the unit I bought has the thicker cables they
provided rather than the thinner ones. Perhaps there are even better quality
cables available for it. I'll look into that option.

   To some extent, yes. Thanks.

   Anyone have a set of known-high-quality KVM cables I can borrow for a
test?

This has changed in 2.6.  You don't need the "make dep" anymore.  You
do:

  "make <config-of-your-choice> ; make ; make install ; make modules_install"

where <config-of-your-choice> for me is usually "oldconfig", which
will use as much of the old .config (which you can copy from an
appropriate location, say /boot/config-<old-kernel-version> to .config
in the source tree root).  If you want to change anything, then you
can do a "make menuconfig" (or whatever) before proceeding.  The "make
clean" is superfluous in most cases.  If you want to be sure you are
starting from a really clean tree, do a "make mrproper", but be sure
to copy your valuable .config files somewhere else so it doesn't get
stomped on.

The semi-colon command separators aren't necessarily intended
literally.  You need to be root to do the last two.  Some people use
command compositions that cause the chain to halt on abnormal
terminations, although I usually just do the "make oldconfig" and any
adjustment manually.  FWIW, this is what I will do when 2.6.9 arrives:

  $ cd /src
  $ tar xjvf /src_archive/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.9.tar.bz2
  $ cd linux-2.6.9
  $ cp /boot/config-2.6.8.1 .config
  $ make oldconfig

if necessary:

  $ make menuconfig 

then:

  $ make -j4 ; su -c 'make install ; make modules_install'

where the -j4 make option controls the number of concurrent jobs and
is appropriate for dual-proc SMP boxes.  It'll pause for a root
password when it hits the "su".  Then I'll modify /boot/grub/menu.lst
to add a stanza for 2.6.9 and reboot.

I don't use initrd's, so if you are, there is some additional
incantation required that I don't know much about.

Getting back on the camera problem, I think I'd look for why you can't
mount the camera as a USB Mass Storage device, rather than punt
immediately to the NTFS route.  You don't want yourself to be
dependent on windows.  I suspect maybe an absence of SCSI support?
Have you shown us the results of an "lsmod" or your .config.

At the clinic last weekend I solved someone's problem with a USB thumb
drive thingie on Debian, which boiled down to the right modules not
getting loaded.  The whole thing got solved by looking at his lsmod
and his .config file to see if/how the support was compiled.  He had a
kernel with the config information readable in /proc/config.gz (or
very much like that), which made things easy.

Yes! I have an Olympus, not "supported" either, and
the same strategy works. I have been using 

mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/camera

I got what I wanted. For those using a modern version
of RH, they offer a utility to keep your system
updated. It installs a new kernel, so you might want
to reboot after performing an update.

What groups do "rshepard" belong to?  If "rshepard" doesn't belong to
the group  "vmwin98" then you wont be gained access to the samba
share.  When logged into linux as rshepard type `groups` or look in
/etc/group to see if your in there.

Also,  When Evan asked what kind of security mode samba was using he
was refering to the  "security =" line in the [Global] section of
smb.conf. The most common is "security=user" and is what you want.

# "security = user" is always a good idea. This will require a Unix account
# in this server for every user accessing the server.

Check to see if samba can look up your username it its password file.
You can do this with the `pdbedit` command.  example: pdbedit -Lu
rshepard
brian at ibook:~$ sudo pdbedit -Lu brian
brian:1000:Brian Benson,,,

Also, you can watch the sambe log file while your trying to login from
win98.  That will tell you why it doesnt work.  for example:
$ tail -f /var/log/samba/log.smbd

good luck.

Brian,

   Bingo! That was a group that I did not copy over from the former, RH-7.3,
system to the current one. As soon as I did mapping the drive worked.

Thanks very much,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0409271003330.8777@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Rather than trying to find all the pieces for Dan Bernstein's caching dns
server on the tape backup I decided to rebuild it on the new system. I'm
stuck at the first step: building and installing daemontools. I followed all
instructions on the appropriate Web page and get compilation errors:

   Has anyone a suggestion? It built fine on the old RH 7.3 so I don't
understand why it is breaking now. I find a reference to 'make' in
package/compile but I see no function 'main'.

I'm sure Randal would be delighted to be in the company of Ms. Streep,
but probably doesn't anticipate her getting mail @stonehenge.com. You
may wish to try "merlyn at stonehenge.com" <grin>

djbdns has a bug where it assumes errno is an actual integer.  This
worked fine on older glibc, but breaks with newer glibc.  I have seen
patches for this.

Ian,

   Thank you. I guess it's time to try to contact Dan Bernstein and see if he
has a fix. I'll also check with google to see if I can find one.

Ian,

   It ain't only djbdns. Qmail has the problem, so does apache. I've not yet
found either the patch itself or one specific to djbdns. It's a pretty
wide-spread problem, apparently.

Apparently, I confused a vehement, unreserved and serious opinion that
came with no supporting evidence, with an argument from authority.

In email, the difference between the two should be blindingly obvious,
of course.  And given that, there's no possible chance someone might
be discouraged from trying something despite such a, erm, "vehement
opinion."

"Get some therapy."  Thanks for the suggestion.  I guess it's a nicer
alternative to the usual sort of crude suggestion involving where one
can insert one's opinion.

I'm having the following issue.  We got our email server up and running

I can tell all of this email is junk, but our server should be pulling

   Well, well, well. At the bottom of the page for tinydns.org is a short
paragraph about this problem. It apparently arose with glibc-2.3.1. There
are several flavors of patch out; all replace,
 	extern int error
with
 	#define <error.h>

Nothing on the daemontools or other Web pages about the need to apply the
patch if the library is 2.3.1 or newer.

Thanks!

There's a guy with platinumrule.com as a domain name that's sniffing
around my name, theplatinumrule.com.

He's interested in trading or having me name a price for my recently
re-registered name. I've had it since July 2000.

What do domain names go for in situations like this? I've got hard costs
in printing and advertising, obviously, not to mention a few sites that
hang off it like my son's BSA troop.

Any insight welcomed.

It is a problem with all of Bernstein's software.  I am pretty sure it
has been pointed out to him but he hasn't released fixed versions.

I have never heard of the problem with Apache.  That may be a sympton
of a deeper build problem.

I heard someone claim to sell myinbox.com years ago for $25,000.  A closer
acquaintance sold memyselfandi.com for $5,000 about the same time.

Back when I got what seemed like serious offers (rather than the spam
ones I also get), I'd quote six figures and they usually went away and
left me alone.  I was actively using it and wanted to continue, but
six figures would get my attention.  If they were serious, I figured
that they would counter-offer with whatever they thought was
reasonable.  They never did.  Boohoo.

   From what I have read he's rather arrogant and aloof. Those who are
isolated in the Ivory Towers of Academe tend to become that way. I write
from experience -- not me but those with whom I work on the state's science
team.

   There was a reference to it when I did my search for error.h patches.

Oh, I was talking about standard http upload.  WebDAV looks somewhat
like mounting a remote filesystem, generally.

The highest offer for patch.com was $15,000 or so.  That was in the .com
boom days, pre 2000.

I'd suggest you have the potential buyer make you an offer.  At that
point it's his budget vs. your decision.  How attached are you to the
domain you have?  What alternative domain names do you have available
to move to?  Are you particularly attached to the name?  are just a few
of the questions to ask yourself and figure out what it's worth.

I have this installed, but I don't exactly know what to do with it. If
I just turn off the power (push the button), it interrupts with an
orderly shutdown, but doesn't hibernate. I couldn't find anything in
the docs to assist.

If there was a handy command to show more details on the system, I'd
run it and include it with the next update.

   I'm gaining a lot of insight into how it works. For a service business it

   I'll see what I have on the box in the way of utilities. Since I bought it
with the OS pre-installed I don't pay much attention to how they made things
work.

My SO and I are looking to run something to help us track where the
money's all going.  So far I've looked at cbb and gnucash.  Either will
work, but neither has a web interface AFAICT.  The ideal package would
let either of us connect from work via http or https, since one of us
works where xhosting over SSH isn't an option.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

You're bouncing spam?!

The envelope sender addresses are not real. Your bounces are all likely 
to bounce, or go to innocents.

Solution:
Don't bounce spam. Nobody does that anymore, really. If on the off 
chance that spam is using a real (harvested) email, an unsuspecting user 
gets a bounce for something they didn't send. So, they email their 
support people. Ugh.

It might be over-kill but SQL-Ledger is web based.

He really is arrogant... he flamed a friend of mine on usenet for
pointing out how DBJDNS fails to follow an RFC (with regard to multiple
A records - round-robin)... firmly stating that his DNS server does
follow the RFC..

It doesn't, FWIW.  The problem was in relation to the NTP Pool servers
and is apparently not all that uncommon.

Rod,

   I was going to respond to the original post but decided to keep my peace
as I don't know of a Web-based solution.

   SQL-Ledger is not something I would recommend for personal finance. It's
much too complex, designed for product-based businesses (manufacturing and
distributing) with service businesses stuck on as an after-thought. I'm
working my way through it now to run payables and receivables at the end of
the week. Not pretty.

   Except for the remote access issue I'd strongly recommend gnucash for
personal finance. If one can wait to twiddle with it in the evenings then
it's a Really Good Thing.

If I enter: 
 	echo -n mem > /sys/power/state
The system writes something to a file, and drops power. It happens
fast enough that I don't think the logs are able to capture it; at
least I can't find any entries. It does complain on boot about not
being able to install mkmdp (whatever that is).

If I enter: 
 	echo -n disk > /sys/power/state
Nothing happens.

With the windows machine, when you logout you are presented with a
login/shutdown screen. If you press the shift key and click on
suspend, it goes into hibernate mode. Rebooting is very fast.

I'm thinking (perhaps incorrectly) that from within the KDE session
there should be some similar mechanism. On my old thinkpad, there was
a keystroke combination that would invoke the hibernation event (which
worked in DOS/Windows/OS2, but not in linux -- and IBM had already
obsoleted the hardware so wouldn't provide any clues). I don't know
what that keyboard combination might be on the VAIO, as it was bought
used, and the owners manual is missing.

Message-ID: <9e0a3578040927190643953a5@mail.gmail.com>

I occasionally get the following Kernel Panic on a Dell 2650 running
RHES 3r3 with the latest updated RedHat kernel, 2.4.21-20.
(typed in since the original was an image screen shot):

Process sh (pid: 31555, stackpage=ccb57000)

Code: Bad EIP value.

Kernel panic: Fatal exception

This box runs Oracle and uses NFS mounts on a NetApp filer.  My
suspicion, based on the function calls before the panic, is that when
the filer is bogged down then something screwy happens in the NFS
module causing the kernel panic.
Any other thoughts on what might be causing the panic?
Thanks,
~M

   Trying to get my fiancee's machine to access her mail spool on the server.
This is what I have for qpopper:

[root at salmo ~]# locate qpopper 
/etc/mail/qpopper.config
/etc/log.d/conf/services/in.qpopper.conf
/etc/log.d/scripts/services/in.qpopper

   But, when she tries to collect mail (with thunderchicken on the ThinkPad)
a message box pops up "Cannot connect to salmo. Connection refused by
server."

   This all worked before, of course. Right now I'm without a clue what piece
is missing. I'd appreciate a clue card on where to look.

Thanks,

Rich

You have a script somewhere... but is it even running?

If using inetd/xinetd, check the config. Also, it should be listening on 
port 110. ('netstat -an | grep LISTEN' to view all ports in that state.)

If not using inetd, then ps should show a qpopper process running. Not 
sure if it even has a daemon mode, now that I think about it :)

Should be a few steps in the right direction. Sorry, I don't know any 
distro-specific gui's or tools to add things to various run-levels.

It turns all the way off rather than hibernate? On mine, after the
"suspend to memory" action finishes, the power light blinks continuously,
and pressing a mouse button (of a PS/2 mouse) un-suspends it.

Also, the daemon "acpid" can be used (supposedly -- I haven't tried it) to
have things be done in response to a press of the power button. An excerpt
from the man page:
EXAMPLE
       This example - placed in /etc/acpi/events/power - will shut  down  your
       system if you press the power button.

       event=button/power.*
       action=/usr/local/sbin/power.sh "%e"

       The  script power.sh gets called and will see the complete event string
       as parameter $1.


> If I enter:

> Nothing happens.

That's probably because the code to suspend to disk isn't present in the
kernel. Here is an excerpt of my kernel config file:
#
# Power management options (ACPI, APM)
#
CONFIG_PM=y
CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND=y
CONFIG_PM_DISK=y
CONFIG_PM_DISK_PARTITION="/dev/hda2"

Also, I found that the ethernet isn't usable after unsuspending it. (Maybe
reloading the driver module would make it usable again.)

Charlie,

   I assumed that, too. But, I no longer remember the name of the daemon.

   I know that Thunderchicken is configured to connect on 110. The server,
however, ... isn't listening. Hmmm-m-m. That's at least part of the problem,
eh?

   Guis are gooie. I need to go look up how to turn on the tap on 110 for the
server then go find what qpopper's mode is.

Rich

Rich, it sounds like qpopper isn't running or you've got some iptables
blocking the conection.

First check if salmo is listening for pop on tcp port 110.

brian at ibook:~$ netstat -ln | grep 110
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:110             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     

if its there then you got an iptables problem.
if not then check /etc/inetd.conf (or xinetd) and make sure qpopper
isnt commented out.

pop-3           stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd 
/usr/sbin/in.qpopper -f /etc/qpopper.conf

good luck,
-Brian

Brian, Charlie, et al.:

   Qpopper wasn't running. So I downloaded and built the latest version
(4.0.5) and modified both /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/services as the
intallation guide directed.

   Now it is.

   Slightly different syntax recommended in the manual. But, it works now. I
just tested it on the ThinkPad and she has 142 new messages awaiting her.
That's not bad considering it's been since 7 Sept. when the planned move to
a different motherboard/cpu caused the major upheaval here.

   I think now that it will be several more weeks as I discover things not
running when I expcted them to. But, I have the tape restore image on disk
and can just get the latest version and build on that. At least now all
boxes here (two workstations, two portables) are running Slackware-10.0 so
they're all current and equal. No more problems with different distributions
and versions.

   Thanks all. I think that now I can focus exclusively on marketing and my
book (delayed by the Great Adventure).

TTFN,

Rich

Also, most likely, the spam being delivered there is going their 
directly. Many spammers deliver to the second or third mailhost on 
purpose, because most second or third mailhosts can't or don't do all 
the checks that the primary does.

Consequently, they have successfully delivered the mail, and charge 
their customers accordingly.

I've seen this last line on a box that had memory problems. But I'm no

Message-ID: <20040928043302.GA12133@gate.kl-ic.com>

Hello - I just updated to Mozilla 1.7.3 as per recent security
warnings.  Now it seems to crash whenever I look at certain Frontpage
with M$Java sites;  I may have to return to 1.7.2 and take the security
risk.  Before I do that though:

I am using the following plugins with Mozilla:
    libjavaplugin_oji.so ( 1.4.2_05 )
    libflashplayer.so ( 6.0 r79 )
    plugger.so   ( 5.1.3 )
    rpnp.so ( 8.0 ) (yes, I know 10 is available, but I do not have
                     time to read another EULA if I don't need to)

This is on one Fedora Core 1 system and 2 Redhat 9 systems.  All three
crash on sites like http://www.ganssle.com .

What are other folks using for plugins for Mozilla?  Right now, I am
most concerned with which Java option to choose, and plugger vs
mozplugger , if any of those steps cures the crashes.

You bet, debian can be installed using floppies.  You can download the
images needed to install the latest sarge release candidate at the
following url:

http://people.debian.org/~joeyh/d-i/images/daily/floppy/

The installation guide can be found at:

Not sure if it will help any but I do know that there are many mailing

have seen this issue and can help you out with this problem.  Check

For booting a partitioner, I have found Recovery Is Possible (RIP) to be

Hello - I just updated to Mozilla 1.7.3 as per recent security
warnings. 

(Note deleted about crashes - stupid installer trick.
libjavaplugin_oji.so  needed to be a symlink, which did not get
passed in the simple cp from older plugins to new - duh!  So this
message morphs to:)

I am using the following plugins with Mozilla:
    libjavaplugin_oji.so ( 1.4.2_05 )
    libflashplayer.so ( 6.0 r79 )
    plugger.so   ( 5.1.3 )
    rpnp.so ( 8.0 ) (yes, I know 10 is available, but I do not have
                     time to read another EULA if I don't need to)

This is on one Fedora Core 1 system and 2 Redhat 9 systems.  

Still, even after fixing the crashes, I am interested in using the
best performing plugins.  For example,  which Java runtime environment?
( Sun | IBM | Blackdown )??  Should I be using mozplugger instead?
Other plugins enhancing my por\\\ fine animation viewing pleasures?

What are other folks using for plugins for Mozilla?

This first one roots windoze, but I assume we are next.  Get that

Sorry, I missed the boat.  What version of Mozilla is vulnerable?

What I suspect is happening is dnscache uses resolv.conf (probably
through the standard resolver library) to figure out which dns servers
to query when it doesn't know an answer. So when you list only localhost
it can only respond with stuff it already knows about. 

>    Is there a way to test what might be broken?

Use dig, or another dns query tool to directly query dnscache and makes
sure it is giving the result as opposed to your system trying the next
server listed in resolv.conf. Optionally you can use a packet sniffing
tool to watch for when dnscache sends a query to an external server. 

I'd give you hints on how to go about doing that, but it's been quite a
while since I've had to mess with all that and I've forgotten the
syntax.

Depends on the buyer's need.  I understand that beaver.com went for
$40,000 US.  Asking price, I believe, was 50 or 60 thousand.
  Want to guess what kind of site it is now?  The original owner had a 
_more_ acceptable business with the word beaver in it.  (Yes I am 
protecting those involved and no I'm not one of them.  :-)

Daniel,

   I think this is the crux of the matter. Since I just got the cache running
again there cannot be too much already cached in it.

Mark,

   There are several. Tom's Root Boot is one. Floppyfw is another (but
limited to firewall functions). You can also take almost any distribution's
boot floppies (I know that Slackware has them; Red Hat used to) and boot
from them. Then run fdisk (or cfdisk) to partition the drives.

Keith,

   I just went there using firefox-0.9.3 with no problems. There was a
message box that said I would not get the full flavor without some java
plug-in, but I shrugged and told it to go away.

   If you don't need all the mozilla components consider using firefox. Also,
FWIW, I generally keep firefox security very high. For those sites that
demand java, cookies or only being viewed by Internet Exploder I use opera.
It's set to allow cookies, java and reports itself as IE-6.

HTH,

Rich

Keith,

   Under what circumstances does one encounter jpegs in the wild? I'm not
being facicious: are they embedded in Web sites?

   On the mail side, those of us who use pine, mutt, emacs and others don't
have a problem with this.

Question about this. If you categorize mail as spam, not spam,
and "unsure" - what do you do with the "unsure" mail. I've been
bouncing it. Also, when I look at my sendmail logs, it appears
that the *majority* of spam that comes to my server is for
users that simply don't exist. It appears that a number of
spammers just send to the "100 most common names" at every domain
they can think of. All these messages are bounced with a "no such user"
type message by sendmail, right?. Thoughts?

I guess what I don't understand is that if I don't have a spam filter 
running then what is bouncing the spam?  Should I just ignore all 
bounced messages?

That's not too bad then.. but you're still seeing a pileup, so it can't 
be too good. I accept unsure mail, and filter to a SPAM folder, and in 
turn verify there are no false positives. I also feed spam and ham to 
sa-learn for bayesian scoring.. I haven't had a false positive in ~9 months.
For large sites, its hard to do that. We just started dropping all spam 
at my work, and let users choose if they wanted "all or none" (those 
would get on a whitelist).

Also, when I look at my sendmail logs, it appears

I hope not bouced.. those shouldn't be accepted in the first place. 
(i.e. should result in a 5xx code during the initial SMTP transaction)
Things that aren't resulting in a DSN, like the above, can't pile up in 
your mail q. This is a good thing.

I categorize based on SpamAssassin scores. For inbound messages with a 
single recipient, required_hits comes from the recipient's 
~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file. Messages with multiple recipients 
gets user_prefs from a generic config, which currently sets 
required_hits at 4.5.

* if score >= (required_hits + 3.0), sendmail will reject it with a
   550 error during the SMTP transaction. I use milter-spamc for
   this operation.

* if score is > required_hits and < (required_hits + 3.0),
   spamassassin will add its headers, but filtering such messages
   is left at recipient's discretion.

* if score is < required_hits, mail is passed through as-is.

My experience is that a relatively small percentage of messages fall 
into the middle category. The ratio between the first two categories 
is somewhere in the neighborhood of 9:1. Of the messages in that 
"unsure" category, the very few false positives tend to be from people 
with poorly configured HTML-enabled mail clients.

I installed blackdown's vm a while back.  But at times I would notice
my system getting unresponsive and find that the java_vm was running
amok, long after I had left the site that contained a java app.  I

I switched to sun's vm and the problem went away.  Now this was a

Yes, they're on websites.  All over the place on websites.  Anything
meant to look 'real' will be a JPEG, generally speaking.

I didn't think I had to worry about this one, but this spurred me
to check.  The vulnerability is in the Graphic Device Interface plus DLL
(gdiplus.dll) used in some versions of Windows.  Linux is immune.
I think that Firefox or Mozilla on windows will also be safe.

   Oh. So, by loading that page we're sucking a copy of the virus into our

Subject: [PLUG] Upgrade to Mozilla 1.7.3 *now*
Message-ID: <20040928165527.GA17128@gate.kl-ic.com>

Please check out the Mozilla site for more information.  Here's a 
summary of what is happening.  This is a Big Thing.

Early in September, we started seeing notices about buffer overflow
vulnerabilities in the decoders for common graphics formats used by
Microsoft products.  Unfortunately, the vulnerability is apparently
in the common DLLs used by the Microsoft compilers, so it affects
vast swaths of applications, like anything that can display a JPEG
or a PNG, for example.  It probably goes all the way back to the
public algorithms originally proposed to parse these formats.  

So about 10PM Eastern Time Monday night, we started getting reports
of JPEG trojans being observed on some of the major servers.  There
are windoze machines getting with this exploit now.  I misreported it,
it is not a virus, yet, but that is only because the uploaded rootkit
does not automatically propagate itself.  That is merely a matter of
changing the uploaded payload (with no change in the penetrator),
so essentially the virus storm begins as soon as some cracker
changes the payload from a known rootkit to a known propagator.

We are not exempt.  Mozilla and libgtk are two examples of open
source applications with the very same vulnerability - again, they
grew from the same public algorithms.  While there were no exploits as
of late last night, a new exploit may be propagating as you read this.

How does this affect you?  If you use Mozilla or any other web
browser to look at any websites anywhere that contain any pictures
or graphics, or use an email app to look at pictures, and you have
not upgraded those apps in the last week, then you are vulnerable.
This vulnerability is at the user level;  a cracked Mozilla or
Evolution or w3m can do anything you can do as a user, such as fire
up processes that spew virus email, or change any web pages you have
write permission for.  And of course if you have any vulnerabilities
accessable from the user level (and there are hundreds), then you
WILL be rooted.

The graphics exploit does require that you actively read the email or
visit a potentially cracked website (say, CNN.com);  it is not a worm
and cannot penetrate your passive machine.  Nor can it do anything if
you run no graphical applications on Internet-sourced data.  But most
of us use web browsers with images turned on, and many of us use
graphics-enabled mail readers.   Libgtk drives most Gnome programs,
so anything that interprets graphics is at risk, if those graphics
can come from elsewhere, or can be gotten onto your machine by some
means.  You are dependent on a very thin eggshell right now.

I do not know about libgtk, but these vulnerabilities have been
addressed in the very latest Firefox, and the very latest Mozilla,
version 1.7.3, which was released in mid-September 2004.  I am
running the new Mozilla now.  Mozilla versions 1.7.2 or earlier
(and corresponding Firefoxen) do NOT have the fix and ARE vulnerable. 

These changes have not propagated to the distros, yet;  unless you
use up2date or apt-get, those CDs and packaged distros will have 
the old versions and the existing vulnerability.  The 3.6 Knoppix
disks I have been passing out, for example, use Mozilla 1.7, and
are August 2004 packagings of early-2004 versions.  These are all 
vulnerable applications, and I expect them all to be thoroughly
exploited within a few weeks.

If you are running Mozilla, please download the new version Right Now 
Only.  It may not be safe to use an older Mozilla to download this
replacement in a day or two.  And if libgtk (and the KDE equivalent)
are exploited, then Opera and Konqueror and Galeon and others are
not safe alternatives, though as a practical matter they will
probably be exploited later than Mozilla and Firefox will be.  

Download those upgraded versions of Mozilla and Firefox NOW.  If you
have questions, ask here.  And when an improved libgtk or libkde(?)
appears, download that, too.   And if you have any Windoze machines
around, update those, of course, and assume that no graphics apps are
safe to use on internet data until they are vetted in some other way.

This is not business as usual.  Hurricane JPEG is 100 miles offshore
and coming in fast.  Have a *nice* day.

Image files are parsed and "executed" by various rendering libraries. 
If those libraries don't do proper bounds checking, regardless of 
whether the host OS is Windows or Linux, a buffer overflow could 
occur.

The fact that the current exploits target x86 Windows systems doesn't 
mean that a similar exploit couldn't be released that targets Our 
Favorite OS. Recently, libraries within libxpm4, ImageMagick, gtk2, 
gdk-pixbuf, and Mozilla have all been found vulnerable to certain 
buffer-overflow exploits.

Any ideas on how to get this for Fedora Core 1 in RPM?  All I see are Core 
2 RPMs and SRPMs.

Maybe a little more searching will get results but I'm hoping others may 
have a QaD solution.

I didn't bother with the rpm, there was a gzipped tarbar available on the
front page or mozilla.org.  Once extracted it's pretty much
self-installing into its own directory.

So what do the bad guys actually do with a "buffer overflow"? How does 
that run a virus installer instead of just crashing?

Yeah I've done that before but I'm hoping to keep my systems RPM'd.

Here's some instructions on turning the tarball into an RPM.  This 
definitely qualifies as QaD.

I found this link:

It has links to FC2.  Dunno how you can verify the integrity/safeness of
the download.  Looks legit.

  Basically, any program that accepts an input can be buffer overflowed.
The overflow may contain an executable program, including an FTP client.  

I believe the definitive article is still the original from Phrack.  

	`smash the stack` [C programming] n. On many C implementations
	it is possible to corrupt the execution stack by writing past
	the end of an array declared auto in a routine.  Code that does
	this is said to smash the stack, and can cause return from the
	routine to jump to a random address.  This can produce some of
	the most insidious data-dependent bugs known to mankind.
	Variants include trash the stack, scribble the stack, mangle
	the stack; the term mung the stack is not used, as this is

Paul,

   Therefore, there are frantic efforts under way at the developers and
distributors. I expect a bunch of update messages soon. Thanks for the

You know, it seems that the installer does indeed install an RPM.  You
just run the install script and now it is in my rpm database (maybe this
was obvious to everyone else):

$ rpm -qa | grep firefox
firefox-0.9.3-0.fdr.4


The Mozilla home page seems to autodetect your distribution.  I suspect
that you could dig around to specify the installer to download.

Essentially, they poke a different return address onto the stack that
points at whatever they want the program to do next, like fork a shell
or, in this case, launch whatever infection/replication program they
want.

I am sure there are plenty of better explanations available online.

Actually, these are the projects that already have fixes. See, for 
example, the Linux Weekly News summary of security alerts issued for 
Slackware:

   http://lwn.net/Alerts/Slackware/

The Slackware packagers have already released fixes for several of the 
announced image-rendering vulnerabilities.

   I remember downloading the mozilla and libpixbuf packages more than a week
ago and installed them on all boxes before the weekend. However, I leave
tracking the security front to you professionals. As an amateur I just
upgrade packages when they're made available.

Heh.  The other day while trying to figure out WTF was soaking up my

   I ask the subject question because of Sun's re-alignment with Microsoft
and their announced business goal of killing off Red Hat and linux. (Groklaw
has a very interesting article on the transition and the FUD involved.)
Since Sun has become anti-OSS I guess we're all wondering about the future
of OpenOffice.org (for which Sun shares the copyright with OO.o) and Java
(which they retain as closed source).

   For those developing commercial applications: what do you think with

It would probably be an overstatement to say Sun and M$ are in
"alignment".  .NET, after all, is in direct competition with Java for
the enterprise market, especially with this new "Web services" craze. 
Java has a whole lot of momentum at this point.  I think the whole J2EE
thing is a crock, personally, but still I don't see .NOT passing it by
any time soon.  And Java as a language is proven and mature, with lots
of useful, well-defined libraries.  Besides which, it's just simply a
well designed language, fixing a lot of C++'s flaws without being
inaccessible to C++ coders.  So I seriously doubt it's in any danger.

Anyway, in the unlikely event of Sun deciding to pull the plug on Java
(and why would they?), the OSS crowd would produce a viable replacement
within half a year.  Which would probably look as much like Java as .NOT
does!

Jason,

   Have you seen the reports about their patent sharing and Microsoft
granting Sun immunity from patent infringement lawsuits? From what I've
read, Sun's mouth moves and Microsoft's words come out.

Great, but is it Mozilla that's vulnerable, or is it the system library
that renders JPEGs?  Does Mozilla do its own decoding/rendering?  If
not, I can't see how it might plug this hole.

Ignoring all of the legal considerations, the question about whether Java is a suitable choice for
developing commercial applications is a tricky one because the problem domain of the coder is not
the same problem domain as the coder's boss.

Programmers generally want a tool that will allow them to solve the problem at hand with
relatively few distractions.  Having to constantly look up the arcane syntax to solve a common
problem or having to write a lot of support code that's not directly related to the problem at
hand is not something the programmer wants to do.  For example, think about reading lines of a
file with Java:

  try {
    FileInputStream fstream = new FileInputStream(args[0]);
    DataInputStream DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(fstream);
    while (in.available() !=0) {
      System.out.println (in.readLine());
    }
    in.close();
  }
  catch (Exception e) {
    // ignore the bad exception handling, please :)
    System.err.println("File input error");
  }

Before I can even *think* about reading the lines from a file, I have to instantiate object from
two different classes!  That's pretty annoying and is grunt work.  Given that many argue that
programmers tend to write the same number of lines of code per day regardless of the language, one
might wonder if such verbosity is merited.  Programmers often think "no."  (Of course, this is
very concise and powerful syntax compared to some other languages.)

The manager, on the other hand, often thinks in terms of safety.  She probably won't get fired for
choosing Java (even if she doesn't know what it is.)  She has less worry about an incompetent
programmer opening up a socket in some code that shouldn't do that.  She doesn't have to worry
about the programmer forgetting to check to see if system calls are successful.  In short, Java is
a fairly safe, heavily monitored playground.  For some businesses, that's perfectly acceptable
(and even required.)

Also, while certifications are often ridiculed, the manager also knows that a J2EE certified
programmers are more likely to know the language and have less trouble learning the company's
framework.  While it's a shaky benchmark, at least it's a benchmark.  By contrast, you won't find
many managers who have *any* way of evaluating the ability of a given Perl programmer.

Personally, I can't say that I'm fond of Java.  It's hybrid procedural/OO structure causes a lot
of problems, checked exceptions can be a nightmare and the sheer verbosity of the code is tedious.
 However, Java programmers are in high demand and the language does have more going for it than
detractors typically admit (particularly Java 1.5.)

So is it good for you?  Depends upon what you need.  If you need a rapid development environment
where you can quickly respond to changes in requirements, dynamically typed languages might be a
better choice:  Perl, Ruby, Smalltalk, etc.  They will *crush* the Java programmer in terms of
sheer productivity (but there are trade-offs there, as well.)

I hope someone provides a more accurate answer, but as I understand
it, the incoming data is placed in buffers that are contained in the
program's stack.   But the stack has all sorts of things on it, 
including other data, return addresses, etc.  If you go beyond the
bounds of the fixed-length buffer set aside to hold the data, you
start scribbling over this other data that belongs to this program. 
So when the program returns from a subroutine, it may go to an address
specified by the cracker, which may point to more scribbled bytes
containing an exec() function call to a system program like wget.
The arguments to that wget make it download a rootkit or some other
nasty from a zombie out there.  A second exec() executes it.  You
can do all that in less than 100 bytes of data;  overflows are longer
only because more spacing is needed to move those bytes into the
right position for the stack return pointer to find them.

We typically run browsers with a lot of permissions, to read and
write files, drive video and sound, etc.;  that means that the virus
can do anything the browser is permitted to do.  For example, it makes
little sense to run a browser in a chroot jail.  So essentially the
virus can do anything the user can do, such as fire up crack at 2AM to
go to work on the password file, or exploit anything suid root, or...

Even if your machine is impervious to rooting, the payload is still
capable of generating gigabytes of viruses, modifying your .bashrc
so that it comes back after a reboot, etc.  Your only warning is 
unusual network activity (do you ever look?) or sluggish behavior.
Perhaps, if you are really careful, you will notice that there is
a running program /home/myname/.r/bash that is actually a password
cracker or virus launcher, but that will require a ps -auxw, and
how many times a day do you run that?  "top" won't show anything
besides a bash process that is a little frisky.

And of course, once you are rooted, all bets are off.  Restore from
backups (when did you last do backups?) or reinstall.

The bottom line is, a JPEG exploit completely bypasses all the
protections a typical Linux system has at the firewall, and exposes
the soft chewy center in ways we have not had to worry about for 
years.  The Linux community will rapidly develop patches for all
these vulnerabilities, because finding and fixing stuff is how
we demonstrate our prowess around here.  But those patches and
upgrades will do you no good if you do not download and install them.

Waiting for somebody to give you an RPM will probably be too late.
Run the mozilla tarball, then re-run the upgrade when an RPM or DEB
arrives at a theater near you.  Just don't dawdle, please.  If you
can no longer trust your browser, how are you going to find the RPMs
you need?  I am not aware of any well-informed text-based search
engines ;  the archie system went away years ago.

Sorry to sound like a Jeremiah here, but undetectable hostile data
that can get through my firewall and walk all over my user area scares
me spitless, and that is with tripwire and secure nightly full backups
in place.  Systems should be secured before the storm hits, not after.

The article "Smashing the Stack" by Aleph One at Phrack.org (see
http://www.phrack.org/show.php?p=49&a=14) referenced earlier on this
thread was about as good an explanation as I could have wanted. It really
gave me the willies! It explains in detail how these dirty deeds are done
and in particular, uses Linux on an Intel box as an example. Since I have
had experience with C and Assembler in the salad days of the computer
revolution, I understood what was going on and was appalled at how easy
this is to do. 

ANY code on ANY platform that interacts with outside resources had better
be VERY careful about using those oh-so-common functions like strcpy(),
strcat(), gets(), and the like --functions that move data and trust, but
don't verify.

Just because code is open sourced doesn't mean that experts will have
checked it out for you, OR (and this is the kicker) that the experts in
the white hats will recognize the exposure before the black hats do. It
might mean that problems can get fixed faster than proprietary code based
on a weak architecture, but I just bet that when Linux becomes as popular
to hack as Microsoft, we're all going live in interesting times.

1) Odds are, that disk was a Windows NT, 2000 or XP boot disk at some
   point in it's life.

2) You might try writing /dev/zero to the floppy and write the image

That isn't Phrack's work at all, and I'm fairly certain ESR would be
fairly annoyed about Phrack's claim to his work as their own.

Debian Stable still has the boot-floppies installer (yes, even on the
CDs; boot-floppies will be going away in favor of debian-installer
currently at RC1 when Sarge goes stable).  If you're going to go that
route, better do it before Sarge goes stable.

   gets() was deprecated by XJ311 but left in the standard to prevent broken
legacy code. Always use fgets(). Similarly, use strncpy().

  The phrack article begins with the excerpt from the Jargon file.  The rest
of the article is original work.

  I remember reading the article in stunned amazement when it came out in
'96.  It got pass around the Engineering shop for a couple of weeks.  We all
started writing overflow code and crashing assorted boxen around the lab.
The old HP Apollo systems seemed especially vulnerable.  It was fun times...

Subject: [PLUG] Kernel compilation (2.6)
Message-ID: <20040929023840.73258.qmail@web50603.mail.yahoo.com>

Carla Schroder maintained that gcc-2.95.3 is
definitely the version to use when compiling a 2.6
kernel. Few of us are using a release of Linux that
installs this version of gcc by default, so I am
wondering how to proceed (on FC2).

I have compiled gcc-2.95.3 in my home directory (using
gcc-3.3.3-7) but have not installed it system wide.
The kernel sources are also in my home directory, but
elsewhere, of course.

If this version of gcc is installed system-wide, Carla
Schroder states that the way to select it is by the
following command:

gcc -V 2.95.3

This is not the command that one would actually use
for kernel building ("make bzImage") so perhaps it
involves an adjustment in the Makefile?

If gcc-2.95.3 can be invoked without system-wide
installation, I'm content to leave it where it is.
Anyhow, what is the best way to make it the active
version of gcc when compiling the kernel?

I haven't tried this, but the top-level Makefile includes this:

	# Make variables (CC, etc...)

	AS              = $(CROSS_COMPILE)as
	LD              = $(CROSS_COMPILE)ld
	CC              = $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc
	CPP             = $(CC) -E

I suspect that editing it to define CC to something else would be one way
to use a different compiler.

BTW, kernels compiled with gcc 3.x seem to work ok for me.

I don't really know how well these things will work, but if you know
what your c compiler's command is to be, use it like this:

make bzImage CC='/path/to/gcc -V whatever'

...I'm pretty sure the ' use is appropriate, but test it out.  :-)

I think that the variable assignment needs to be first, e.g.:

[amunk at sencha ph317]$ CC='blah' sh -c 'echo $CC'
blah
[amunk at sencha ph317]$ sh -c 'echo $CC' CC='blah'

[amunk at sencha ph317]$

Actually, make takes it as an option... I'm not sure if it would work
the other way around... I think $CC is ignored by make most of the time.

Go to www.postfix.org and put a restricted relay in front of you're mail
server the way I did.  If an email address being targeted at my site
doesn't exist, I send a 550 user unknown relaying denied error back.  

Randal of stonehenge.com has some really good ideas on configuring
postfix to accurately deter spam, but I haven't been able to get a hold
of him myself.  One of his ideas is a spamtrap, a backup exchanger after
all of your other exchangers that never accepts mail 550'ing anyone who
tries to use it.  The concept here is that you are not supposed to use
the highest numbered exchanger first.  I'd love to learn how to
implement a spamtrap using postfix.  If you aren't using it, I recommend
Jim Sun's pflogsumm.pl for postfix as it helps you see what's going on.
If you're a sendmail expert great.  Otherwise, consider using postfix
instead.  See http://www.postfix.org/.

Why would errno *not* be an integer?

   No reason at all. It is an int.

   However, that's not the problem. What is the problem can be found in all
error.h headers; DJB has:

extern int errno;

and what is needed is:

#include <errno.h>

   Making this change in all error.h allows compilation to proceed.

   Well, since GNU's not UNIX why should Linux be? I think you can get some
good insight into this latter issue from Darl McBride and the head-shed at
Sun.

"Two different classes!"?  :)  Is that really so bad?  Those two stream
classes are actually a good example of the balance Java achieves between
simplicity and flexibility.  FileInputStream knows how to read local
files at a byte level, and DataInputStream knows how to translate those
bytes into more useful things.  If they were the same class, then the
functionality in DataInputStream could not be applied to other types of
lower-level streams, as for reading from a socket, for instance.

Incidentally, it's common to combine those two lines into one:

DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream(args[0]));

Right, that's part of its power.  By eliminating all those stupid
pitfalls, the programmer can focus more on good design, which is what
OOPLs are all about.

You must be thinking of C++!

Mmmmm, that too may be an overstatement.  For a large-scale app', I
serious doubt Perl could hold a candle to Java.  It might take an early
lead, but as the design takes on complexity, Perl will become buggy and
incomprehensible where Java will not.  Java is relatively bugless. 
Smalltalk may do as well, but it's been a while since I've used that.

The thing with Java is, if you know what you're doing, you can create a
very coherent, easily maintainable system of any size.  Perl is good for
a fast hack, but you have to think about the cost of maintenance.

   FW-W-E-E-E-ET! Time out!

   I did not intend to start a flame war over whose programming language is
better. And we've just decided there is insufficient traffic to justify
plug-devel.

   My question was specifically in light of Sun's corporate re-alignment
(without benefit of chiropractor) away from OSS to the Black Hole of
Redmond. That's all.

   One of the reasons new programming languages pop up like dandelions in my
lawn is that someone always has a Better Idea. Let's not fight over them:
pick your favorite one(s) and let the rest go. Please! I know we've not had
a distructive flame war here for several months. That's nice. I do not want
to be thought responsible for changing the pattern.

   If you have need to discuss the relative advantages of splitting versus
lumping, please take it private.

Thanks,

  There are also assorted non-executable stack patches for Linux and GCC
that do the same kind of thing.  Including, Crispin's Immunix StackGuard.

  Newer Intel and AMD CPUs include a technology called Data Execution
Prevention (DEP).  The DEP allows specific memory pages to be marked
non-executable.  There is apparently work being done in the Linux kernel to
support DEP.  M$ XP is also moving to DEP based stack protection.

Which begs the question, "What took them so long?"  PowerPC parts have

The guy who gave last month's AT talk (I am too lazy to look up his
name) said something implying that non-executable stack (or was it
pages or something) didn't "work" or that they were a panacea or
something.  Sorry I didn't grasp all the details.  I wonder what he
meant.

And part of the penalty too.  All these things are tradeoffs.  As a
programmer, I agree with Ovid that Java seems too heavy for what I
usually do.  In Lisp, all that instantiation cruft could be hidden
away in a function or macro call.  Ah, the power of abstraction.

Another thing to consider is whether as a programmer you want to
become a pluggable component in someone's software development
machinery.  Standardized programmers means that management can plug-in
and/or throw away programmers as it suits them.  From management's
point of view, that's a good thing.  From a programmer's longterm
point of view, that might _not_ be such a good thing.  I'd rather
develop some niche specialization that is still powerful and
productive, but harder to outsource.

  Marketing?  I remember back in the 90's when a Micro$oft Marketing VP
started fluffing the market about "rich content" and M$-Office providing "a
rich user experience".  It was back in the early days of COM and the MMX
extensions.

  I distinctly remember looking at the flawed COM design and thinking "this
is going to hurt".  All that "rich content" added thousands of lines of code
and who knows how many buffer-overflows and other security holes.  One wag
in the office commented that "those who do not learn Unix are destine to
re-write it."  We're currently paying the price for all that ill-conceived
"rich content".

Like most elements of security, these are not a cure-all.  For
specific examples of how to defeat them, refer to Phrack 56:

http://www.phrack.org/phrack/56/p56-0x05

They can help quite a bit in making buffer overflows harder to
exploit, so they're still useful.  The problem is they're marketed as
a complete solution, when they're not.

Well, I tried both the SquirrelMail calendar and "WebCalendar." The
later seems to work a little better, but I was unable to get it to run
at all without making a certain file world writable (and it clearly
shouldn't be :-)

Neither of these really seems to work all that well. Though of course
my experience with them is limited to a few hours of fooling around.

I'd still love to hear from anyone who is *seriously* using a web
based calendar, if in fact anyone is really doing such a thing.

My wife and I use SquirellMail with their shared calendar and to-do

and other important calendar things.  She uses Outlook on her computer
and I use Evolution (Linux workstation) so the best method I can find to
share information is with the web based solution.  Plus, we can access
our email easier when we travel.  We also have a lot of other plug ins
for squirellmail, such as dictionary, a freecell java game, a weather
plugin, virtual keyboard, secure login, and HTML mail support.  We both
enjoy it.

It really depends on what you are making. Short answer, java is good but may be overkill for little things.

Hey Jason, do you mind if I ask you some details, such as exactly
what versions of things you're using, any configuration details and
so on. When I tried the SquirrelMail calendar plugin, it *appeared*
to work rather poorly. As one example, when I entered appointments on
a given day, they never showed up on that day in the "month view."
I had to click on each day to see if there was anything there.
Also, I noticed the lack of a "to do" list, which most calendars I've
used have had. But from your msg I gather that there is one.

If you'd rather take it off-line, that's okay too. I don't know how
much these details are of interest to the whole list.

You get a shareable calendar with an account with Yahoo. It's free, and 
you don't have to share with everone. However, it lacks a shared group 
calendar from what I see.

Is anyone running RH9 with a 2.4.20 kernel and a firewire PCI card?  Any
problems?  Did you have to rebuild the kernel or load modules?

I have a production server that could use a firewire card to back-up to
a Maxtor External USB/firewire drive once a month and am teetering

hoping the support is there for the firewire PCI card.

I have a firewire video capture card.  I remember that I had toload a 
bunch of modules to get it to work correctly.

Search for a program called "Kino". The FAQ for it has instructions for 
getting firewire working.  (I am not in town or I would look up the link.)

Go here:

I have, although I haven't done it yet. Supposedly
rebuilding the kernel can be avoided, if you have only
one processor in the system.

The Kodak EZ200 is a $50 camera that can be used for
video conferencing (among other things). I purchased
one years ago and verified that it works for this
purpose with Windows.

Attempts have been made to support it in Linux. It
uses the spca-50x driver, available on Sourceforge
("make" "make install").

After this was done, the module loaded ("lsmod"). I
brought up Camstream and found that this driver could
now be selected in addition to my TV card, which works
with Camstream. But when I attempted to use the
camera, the picture was black and the application
crashed.

I have a 2.6 kernel, and use of this driver with such
a kernel is apparently still experimental. Another
point mentioned is that the modules should be compiled
with the same version of GCC as the kernel, and I have
no idea whether this was the case or not. Does anyone
know what version of GCC was used to compile the stock
kernel 2.6.5-1.358 (Fedora 2)? Of course I would also
be pleased to hear from anyone successfully using this
popular camera with a 2.6 kernel.

I used to run this kernel. It's ok for some cards and devices, but a more
recent snapshot of Firewire modules must be compiled into the kernel for
some other devices, I'm pretty sure it includes the SCSI emulation module
which you will need.

Message-ID: <20040930191208.A40AF8F00@tinman.seitzassoc.com>

I'm having a problem receiving a large(~4 MB) email.  I have a
relatively slow machine running our mailserver.  It is running postfix
and amavisd in a before-queue content filter setup.  When it receives
the large email, it takes a long time for amavis to decode the parts of
the message.  The sender(a yahoo mailserver) times out(~160 seconds)
before amavis can finish decoding the parts.  I've tried adding the 
following to my amavis.conf file.

@bypass_virus_checks_acl = qw( galens at seitzassoc.com );
@bypass_banned_checks_acl = qw( galens at seitzassoc.com );
@bypass_spam_checks_acl = qw( galens at seitzassoc.com );

This speeded up processing, but it's still too slow.  What would be useful,
but doesn't exist as far as I know, is a bypass_decode_parts_acl variable.

Ideas?  Is it possible to have postfix bypass amavis based on the
recipient or other rules?  While I should just tell the person to use
ftp, I'd like to see if I can make this work.

thanks,
galen

Apparently the version of GCC I have is the one used
to compile the kernel. That presumably means that I
already did compile the modules with the correct
version of GCC, and that the problem lies elsewhere.
They do have a mailing list, however.

                            Shedding the Darkness

    Nicholas Carr cast a lot of darkness on the IT profession when his
    article, "IT Doesn't Matter", appeared in the May 2003 Harvard
    Business Review. Here's how he summarizes the piece:

      I examine the evolution of information technology in business and
      show that it follows a pattern strikingly similar to that of
      earlier technologies like railroads and electric power. For a brief
      period, as they are being built into the infrastructure of
      commerce, these "infrastructural technologies," as I call them,
      open opportunities for forward-looking companies to gain strong
      competitive advantages. But as their availability increases and
      their cost decreases--as they become ubiquitous--they become
      commodity inputs. From a strategic standpoint, they become
      invisible; they no longer matter.

    Later, he expanded his case in a whole book, Does IT Matter?
    Information Technology and the Corrosion of Competitive Advantage. In
    its preface he adds:

      IT's strategic importance is not growing, as many have claimed or
      assumed, but diminishing. As IT has become more powerful, more
      standardized, and more affordable, it has been transformed from a
      proprietary technology that companies can use to gain an edge over
      their rivals into an infrastructural technology that is shared by
      all competitors. Information technology has increasingly become, in
      other words, a simple factor of production--a commodity input that
      is necessary for competitiveness but insufficient for advantage.

      The emergence of a ubiquitous, shared IT infrastructure has, as I
      will show, many important practical implications, both for how
      companies manage and invest in technology itself and, more broadly,
      for how they think about creating and defending competitive
      advantage.

    Meanwhile, on IT's side, we have Paul Graham, author of Hackers &
    Painters. Graham is a hacker and painter whose fingerprints are on
    Lisp, Bayesian spam filtration and Web-based applications, among other
    things. He's also a helluva writer. This month he came out with a
    must-read essay titled "What the Bubble Got Right". Among its many
    quotable lines are these, which stand in stark contrast to Carr's
    whole case:

      Technology is a lever. It doesn't add; it multiplies. If the
      present range of productivity is 0 to 100, introducing a multiple
      of 10 increases the range from 0 to 1000.

      What would happen if you outsourced everything except product
      development? If you tried this experiment, I think you'd be
      surprised at how far you could get.

      ...in the coming century, good ideas will count for more. That
      26-year-olds with good ideas will increasingly have an edge over
      50-year-olds with powerful connections. That doing good work will
      matter more than dressing up--or advertising, which is the same
      thing for companies. That people will be rewarded a bit more in
      proportion to the value of what they create.

    There might seem to be no consistency between these two points of
    view, but there is. For that we turn to Phil Moore, Executive Director
    of the UNIX Engineering team at Morgan Stanley. At the O'Reilly Open
    Source Convention a couple months back, Phil came forward from the
    audience and said this:

      The trend I've seen in the last ten years...is the exponential
      growth in the variety and the depth and breadth of installation of
      open-source software in our infrastructure.... What I'm seeing is
      that in the infrastructure, the core infrastructure, open source is
      going to take over, leaps and bounds.

    The key word is infrastructure. It's infrastructure, built by IT, that
    gives Morgan Stanley enormous productivity leverage. Nicholas Carr is
    right to observe the commodity nature of ubiquitous IT building
    materials. What he misses, by maintaining a "strategic standpoint" at
    the top of the organizational pyramid, is the unique nature of those
    building materials. Unlike the mined and manufactured metals that make
    railroads and electrical grids, IT's goods are products of human
    creativity. Much of that creativity appears in products sold by
    vendors. But the infrastructural stuff--the material with the most
    leverage--is the product of creativity applied to practical rather
    than commercial needs.

    In open-source development, creativity is applied to many purposes,
    but none more than to the need for solid infrastructure. This is why
    the story of open source growth in the enterprise also is the story of
    IT infrastructure commoditization. It's also why the story of IT
    infrastructure commoditization is different from the story of any
    other commoditization in human history. Given the mental sources of IT
    infrastructural goods, all of it improves far more rapidly than
    anything else that has ever been given the "commodity" label.

    This means nothing could matter more than IT.

    Yet, while open source has committed advocates among the vendors that
    supply IT, some of those advocates are busy casting dark as well. Sun
    COO Jonathan Schwartz, while flattering Linux and open source, paints
    a picture of tough times in Sun's corner of the industry:

      It's tough to compete against a social movement. Especially one in
      which you're a believer. That's what Sun's been facing for the past
      few years when it comes to Linux. Linux represents all the ideals
      we've espoused for decades: openness, freedom, innovation, even
      open source (remember, Sun was started with open source)...

      But the past three years have been tough at Sun - we've been on
      defense against competitors co-opting that social movement against
      us. The economic distress experienced by our core markets (telco
      and financial services) started the storm clouds. But that was
      coupled by our hesitation (more on that in a later blog) to support
      Solaris on Intel or AMD microprocessors--a hesitation that left
      customers wanting to deploy x86-based systems with only two
      choices: Microsoft's Windows, or 'linux.' Given the latter's
      (deserved) popularity, coupled with a precipitous drop in telco and
      financial services budgets, it was easy (especially for HP and IBM)
      to say "Linux is responsible for Sun's problems." We were on
      defense.

    Larry Ellison, Oracle's Samurai CEO, says his industry "is as large as
    it's going to be". Mylene Mangalindan sums up Larry's rap:

      Ellison, sounding like a modern-day Cassandra, paints a dark vision
      of the computer industry's future: increasingly standardized
      products with little distinguishing technology and thin profit
      margins. Sweeping consolidation, prompting the death of 1,000 tech
      companies. Fewer start-ups. And a handful of category-dominating
      winners, which will control innovation.

    Like Sun, Oracle considers itself a friend of open source. It also is
    an aggressive advocate of Linux, with a programming staff that
    contributes to Linux kernel development. And Oracle sales also serve
    as a lever for moving more Linux into enterprise infrastructural
    roles. But the value of infrastructure naturally is subordinated to
    the value the goods Oracle runs on it.

    The way to cast light on all this darkness is by recognizing that
    there are two different though overlapping Open Source communities.
    One makes the goods, and the other puts them to use. Call them
    developers and implementers.

    The distinction between the two is as sharp and as necessary as that
    between the sources of building materials and the builders who turn
    those materials into homes and high-rises. We need to make this
    distinction because, as open source succeeds in the marketplace, the
    second group grows much more rapidly than the first, even as it
    remains much less visible.

    Developers are more visible than implementers because developers are
    the ones who make the goods. As sources of goods, it's easy for
    vendors such as Microsoft and Sun to see open-source developers as
    competitors. What those vendors need to see, along with executives at
    the tops of customer org charts, is that the Open Source community
    that matters most is the one we hear from least. For every Phil Moore
    who speaks up, there are many thousands of other IT professionals who
    quietly build open-source-based IT infrastructure.

    Their practices, which they improve every day and share with their
    colleagues, are no less important yet far more strategic than the work
    being done by the open-source development community on which they
    depend. Both are part of the same lever. It's time we started paying
    attention to the practical end of the thing.

I've yet to get Firewire working on any of my 2.4.20 or 2.4.21

I remember a year or so ago Amazon.Com got itself into a bit _trouble_ 
with it's privacy policy.  I don't remember all the details but it seemed 
Amazon took the position it could do what it wanted with customers 
information that didn't violate any actual laws.

So here I am looking for some books and there is a brand new Borders book 
store a couple of miles from my house (heck everything is a couple of 
miles from my house) but when I look on-line I see Borders and Amazon have 
some kind of deal.

Does Amazon still take the stand it can do as it pleases with my e-mail 
address?

Rod,

   I don't know. But I assume that they are not responsible for the spam I
reject or that slips into my inbox. Of course, since they sell everything
they may also be selling reproductive organ enlargment pills, home financing
and whatever is the latest spam fad.

I thinkthelatest version of Konqueror has popup blocking.  (Don't know. 
Don't use it.)

I recommend Firefox for web browsing.  If that is not available, try 
Mozilla.

I'm moving and need to purge some of my unnecessary junk to lighten my
load.  So I'm getting rid of stuff, some of which people here might
want:

  o A DECstation 3100.  This was the fastest workstation on the market
in 1989.  Complete with all-original monochrome monitor, puck mouse, and
keyboard.  Used to run NetBSD/pmax just fine, but doesn't POST anymore--
it's been sitting in my garage and has gathered some dust.  Would make a
fine addition to your computer museum or your stone souper-computer with
a little TLC.

  o A complete set of Bell Technologies System V/386 3.2 UNIX.  Several
boxes of 5.25" floppies and some nice manuals.  I might even have a
5.25" floppy drive I could throw in, if I can find it.

  o A 19" IBM (Sony Trinitron) monitor from an RS/6000; a Matrox video
card.  This is a fixed-frequency monitor and needs special X{Free,.org}
modelines, but it does reportedly work and the configs are available.  I
got it from a friend but never used it, so it might no longer work;
caveat emptor.

  o A not-too-old Canon copies that always wants paper.  No idea if it's
repairable or not.

  o Some monitors, some old keyboards (including some Mac and Sun), and
other random odd bits.

  o I also have some oldish Sun documentation on SunOS in binders.
It'll probably go out in the mornings trash & recycling unless someone
speaks up.

Items are in inner SE Portland; you haul, I don't have time.

I don't know how to get back the original behavior, but you can work
around it by middle-clicking in the main window. Firefox will do its
best to go to the url you pasted, googling if it's not a url.

If you're already using KDE, using Konqueror will be faster and
