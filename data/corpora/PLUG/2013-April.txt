I think plug, plug-talk and plug-jobs are the ones that get traffic,
and perhaps plug-announce (but you didn't get that last one from me,

Mozilla Socorro: an Open Source crash reporting system evolves.

Socorro collects and analyzes three million crash reports a day 
employing PostgreSQL, HBase, Hadoop, and ElasticSearch glued together 
with Python. Socorro's data analysis drives the stability and 
development priorities of Firefox.  Five years ago, Socorro was a system 
that ran on three machines and was tended by just one person.  In 2013, 
it has evolved to become a distributed system running on 120 machines 
and serving hundreds of terabytes of data.  Meanwhile, companies all 
over the world are adopting Socorro for crash reporting.  This talk, an 
update of one given several years ago, will track the evolution of 
Socorro and its future in the upcoming world of FirefoxOS.


K Lars Lohn is the Herd Patriarch of the Mozilla WebTools Group.  As the 
author and curator of the Mozilla Socorro Crash Reporting System, Lars 
has driven its evolution.  Formerly with the OSUOSL, Lars telecommutes 
for Mozilla from a farm near Corvallis.  While preferring Python, 
PostgreSQL and Harleys, Lars is versed in C++, MySQL and Subarus.

   I just upgraded my Dell Latitude from Slackware-13.37/X86_64 to
-14.0/X86_64, changed the links in /boot, modified /etc/lilo.conf, and ran
/sbin/lilo. When booting now the system hangs at this line:

   Not having encounted this issue before when upgrading a system I'm at a

   I should have mentioned that I searched the Web for this error and found
references to it happening with Red Hat, Ubuntu, and Slackware. Looking at
the linuxquestions.org thread for the latter (from 2010) I tried the
solution recommended there (uncommenting 'chipset VGA' in
/etc/vga/libvga.config) to no avail. Still hangs.

   In /etc/lilo.conf I still have an append line with nomodeset on it.

   I'd like to get this running today or tomorrow as I have a business trip
next week on which I'll need to use the laptop. Suggestions on what to check
are certainly appreciated.

   BTW, since the system will not complete booting I need an alternative way
of viewing and checking files. I boot the Slackware-14.0/x86_64 dvd and
accept defaults until I can log in as root. I then 'mount /dev/sda1 /mnt'
and this allows me to navigate to where changes need to be made, for
example, /mnt/etc/vga/.

I recently had to figure out how to disable the framebuffer completely
under Arch when trying to do a remote install inside a KVM guest over SSH.
 Yay for bookmarks.  See if any of the suggestions in the following post

   Thanks, Daniel. I wonder how arch-specific that thread is.

   I've asked for help in the Slackware forum on linuxquestions.org and Pat
Volkerding provided one suggestion that did not work; I'm waiting for more
feedback to my latest update there.

   I've not had this issue on this laptop before so why it should suddenly
appear after the previous half-dozen or so distribution upgrades escapes my
knowledge base.

Rich,

This appears to be a kernel bug.  The line about "fb: conflicting fb
hw usage..." is a red herring.  It's simply the last line that gets
recorded before the kernel goes bye-bye.  It doesn't matter what
graphics chipset one uses, nor whether one boots with Grub, Grub2, or
Lilo.  The guilty kernels seem to be 3.5 and up.  From some of the
comments on Red Hat's Bugzilla, it appears that the bug was introduced
in an early, non-release version of 3.5.0.

Can you downgrade your kernel?  That seems the most likely fix.  3.4.8
should work (knock plastic!).

Hope this helps,

--Dale

Dale,

   Well, that makes sense to me.

   The default kernel in Slackware-14.0 is 3.2.29 and that's what is
installed. It is interesting that the same kernel in the Sony Vaio booted
with no issues what-so-ever.

Thanks,

Rich

Dale, et al.:

   I stumbled upon a kludge that works -- for now. When booting from the
Slackware distribution DVD one can specify options on the boot: command
line. I used the example on that display page and added the final option of
'fb=off' (without the quotes, of course). The system paused during the boot
process because I had specified to load the boot partition read only and it
was already mounted read-write. Pressing the [Enter] key allow the system to
complete the boot process.

   So, on this Dell Latitude with this Slackware distribution (-14.0/x86_64)
there is a definite problem with specifying a frame buffer (in my case the
VESA line is 'vga=773'). I reported this to Pat and the development team and
offered to perform other tests to identify just why there's a problem so
they can fix it.

PLUG has always managed to have a booth, as well as Personal Telco and

And I volunteer to be the main PLUG booth person, provided others will

Huzzah!  Glad to hear it!  From what I've been reading, this bug is
one of those really NASTY race problems that shows up whenever it
bloody well pleases.  Or when the moons all line up and beam bozo rays
into (some of) the systems.  Horrible problems to find.

Best of luck.  There are a lot of folks looking into this, but every
little bit helps.

Once again, congratulations in getting your machine to run.

Dale,

   Yeah. Pat Volkerding said he found > 2,000 forum messages on this bug
occuring in every linux distribution. It may be related to udev, but that's
way above my pay grade to understand.

> Best of luck. There are a lot of folks looking into this, but every
> little bit helps.

   The 'fix' is to set vga = normal in lilo.conf and not use any frame
buffers. If I correctly understand the situation the only thing frame
buffers do is show a penquin for each CPU core and use the defined screen
resolution from the beginning of the boot process. Turning off frame buffers
means no Tux and the screen resolution starts at 640x400 before switching to
a higher resolution about half way through the boot process.

> Once again, congratulations in getting your machine to run.

   Thanks. I need to take it on a business trip next week so having it fully
functional (except for virtualbox) is a Good Thing(TM).

   Tomorrow I'll boot it up again and try to find why it cannot find a
virtualbox library when it boots. Must be something in the core distribution
that wiped it out during the upgrade. Sigh.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Meeting Announcement

Who: K Lars Lohn of the Mozilla Project
What: Mozilla Socorro: an Open Source crash reporting system evolves.
Where: PSU, 1930 SW 4th Ave. Room FAB 86-01 (Lower Level)
When: Thursday, April 4th, 2013 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of technology freedom

See location H-10 on the PSU map at http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg

Mozilla Socorro: an Open Source crash reporting system evolves.

Socorro collects and analyzes three million crash reports a day 
employing PostgreSQL, HBase, Hadoop, and ElasticSearch glued together 
with Python. Socorro's data analysis drives the stability and 
development priorities of Firefox.  Five years ago, Socorro was a system 
that ran on three machines and was tended by just one person.  In 2013, 
it has evolved to become a distributed system running on 120 machines 
and serving hundreds of terabytes of data.  Meanwhile, companies all 
over the world are adopting Socorro for crash reporting.  This talk, an 
update of one given several years ago, will track the evolution of 
Socorro and its future in the upcoming world of FirefoxOS.


K Lars Lohn is the Herd Patriarch of the Mozilla WebTools Group.  As the 
author and curator of the Mozilla Socorro Crash Reporting System, Lars 
has driven its evolution.  Formerly with the OSUOSL, Lars telecommutes 
for Mozilla from a farm near Corvallis.  While preferring Python, 
PostgreSQL and Harleys, Lars is versed in C++, MySQL and Subarus.

Yes, thank you Joe!

Everyone, may I suggest "Portland Linux/Unix Group" in place of "General 
Linux/UNIX discussion and help (civil and on-topic)"?

Thoughts?

Michael,

   Of course!

   Since the flame wars of a decade or so ago have run out of fuel the
alternate tag you suggest is quite appropriate.

No they haven't, you ... you ... you ... Slackware user!  :-)

Seriously, there's a troll born every minute.  And if trolls
want to post uncivil or off-topic stuff, it helps to point at
the banner and suggest they mosey over to plug-talk, increasingly
loudly if they are persistently clueless.  Without the detailed
banner, loudness (or explusion) will be harder to justify, and
some regulars may get lazy, loading up the main list with stuff
most subscribers don't want to read.

The most recent flame war erupted two years ago, and some folks
left the list because of it.  They stopped leaving when we
forced one person to leave.

Think of the longer banner as a very short EULA.  It helps
cooperative newbies know where to post, and enlists their aid
in policing the main list.  We're geeks, we need algorithms,
our social instincts are weak.

This message itself is off-topic, time wasting chat, sorta, but
the people concerned are subscribed here.  This isn't a majority
vote thing - if we drive away 30% of the subscribers with each
change, we are soon down to a very short list. 

If nobody else objects to opening up this list to chatter, I'll
reluctantly go along, and endeavor to withhold "you'll be sorry"
and "I told you so" when/if unfortunate consequences ensue.

Keith

I concur with Keith.  There is no harm in "civil and on-topic", and
possibly some important help.

Good, unfortunate points.

My top priority is practicality and:

1. I'm glad the name now works in Thunderbird
2. For Twitter I used "PDX Linux/Unix Group" for brevity and wonder if 
"PDX" should be used here
    a. It removes confusion with which Portland (+)
    b. I can't think of anyone who says "P D X Linux..." (-)
3. I DO like the idea of PLUG-Talk, civil and off-topic

Thoughts on the talk list?

Also, Joe pointed out that the jobs list is wide open which obviously 
makes it spammer friendly. Does someone have some history on this? Do 
you think that requiring registration would discourage people from 
posting job openings?

I also see that the page mentions "and another group of Open 
Source-centric consultants, POSSE."

Let's touch on this tonight.

That information should be somewhere on pdx.edu.

May I respectfully suggest:

    "PLUG-Users' civil and on-topic discussion and help".

I'm not sure how mailers will respond to a single single quote mark,
but modulo that and the desired punctuation, it ought to do the job.

Anyone planning on going to LinuxFest this year?

---------- Forwarded message ----------
From: LinuxFest Northwest <info at linuxfestnorthwest.org>

Subject: LinuxFest Northwest 2013 is nearing! Register Now!



Only a few weeks before the big weekend (April 27 & 28)! LinuxFest
Northwest is going on its 14th year, and its bigger than ever before. New
to the fest this year is a brand new building, the BTC Campus Center, which
boasts a new Expo floor, stage, and larger presentation rooms. We also have
over 80 presentations, spanning 2 days, of high quality speakers and
subject matter!

Please visit us at http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org for more information
about logistics, sessions, etc. But here is some dates you need to know:

*T-Shirt cutoff for individual sponsors*
If you want a T-Shirt guaranteed in your size, you MUST register by 12
Noon, April 8th. Any individual spnsors after the cut-off will get a
t-shirt voucher to redeem at the BLUG.org booth, but we will not be able to
guarantee the size.

*Make the fest a breeze, register as an individual sponsor today!*
When you register as an individual sponsor, you get three additional
benefits, not offered to regular attendees:
  * Paid lunch, BOTH days
  * T-Shirt, in your selected size
  * OSCON Goodie Bag
  * The warm feeling of supporting this great cause!

*If you're from out of town, book your hotel TODAY*
Hotels are booking, FAST. Bellingham has one of the highest occupancy rates
IN THE NATION, averaging 93% from April-Sept. The Hampton currently has ~20
rooms available total, the Lakeway Inn is sold out, and the next closest
place is out on Meridian. If you want to be close to the action, we
recommend booking your hotel ASAP to get a decent rate and enjoy the
community after the fest closes.

*After Party*
All registered users are invited to our annual after party! This year,
it'll take place at the Lightcatcher Museum, located at 121 Prospect St
Bellingham, WA from 7PM - 11:30PM. Party goers will have access to the
museum's current exhibits, and of course we'll have FREE Open Source beer,
board games, non-alcoholic drinks, and snack foods. The museum cafe is
staying open for us to serve wine and deserts for a nominal fee as well.
It'll be a great time!

Your badge is your ticket, and required for ALL participants, to attend the
party (make sure you register your partner!). The party is all-ages, but
we'll be checking ID at the door for those who wish to drink.

*Picking Sessions, PRE Register NOW!*
The schedule will be finalized sometime the week of the 8th. To help us
match room size to interest, we ask that everyone login to the LFNW site,
register for 2013 and select sessions they're interested in attending. This
will give us an idea of how best to schedule the rooms.

Also, new this year -- if you pre-register, you can skip the registration
line, as we will have pre-printed badges ready to pick up. So register now
and make it a breeze getting into the fest for 2013.

Thanks for your years of support, and we hope to see you all at LinuxFest
Northwest 2013!

LFNW Organizing Committee

Its a bit of a hike for me but still sounds like a fun event.
However, I don't want to "register" just to find out how much
registration costs as I also have to factor in hotel and transport.
What's so hard about putting up a price list?

The event is free. There is an optional $60 registration that gets you a
t-shirt and free lunch both days.
I have been attending it for the last 10 years and it has always been
great. I highly recommend it.

The lunch is prepared by the students at the culinary school at Bellingham Technical College.  The food Is great.

I've been going since 2007.  I have found the talks to be good.  This is a low-keyed conference that is much better than many that charge a lot of money.

Message-ID: <CAKJipLQSJUwMoyga3JErF-GzibH0hF3w7Yz6st2n_VHNBosOWg@mail.gmail.com>

Is something going to be done about the spam on PLUG-JOBS?
That's all the traffic I have seen on that list since the move to the new
server.
I think it is a good resource to keep, but we should limit it to
subscribers like the other lists.
If someone has a job they are recruiting for, going through the short sub
process isn't all that difficult, and once the job is filled they can unsub.

So, fix it please ;)

Thanks.

I've seen an explosion of spam to the email address I'm subscribed to the
PLUG lists on (and almost everything else for that matter).

By explosion I mean 10-20 items a day, vs. maybe a dozen a week, mostly
filtered into the spam folder by gmail.

Coincidence? Cause? Effect?

The spam on JOBS is inconsequential in the grand scheme of my inbox, and
THANK YOU to our new host.

   Huh! I've noticed no differences at all. Spam on the PLUG mail lists to
which I'm subscribed (and I don't follow the jobs list) are essentially
non-existent. But, I run my own MTA (Postfix) and a text-based MUA (alpine).

I'm not looking for a job, nor do I have employees, so I never
subscribed to the Jobs list. Is there so much traffic there that it
would be annoying to merge it with the main list? If it's just a few
posts a month, I say get rid of it. My mail client has a Delete button
and I know how to use it. :)

The one on the Jobs list is the first and only I have seen ... my email 
ISP is usually not too picky, so I don't know what to say, accept I 
haven't seen any (except that one).

Well true you can just delete it, but the point is, there wasn't spam on
that list before the move.
So whatever was setup on it before, can it be setup again that way?

I for one am looking for a job, though it seems the actual job posts
traffic of late has been a bit thin to nonexistent.

In any case, we should not leave a mailing list like this just wide open to
spammers or spambots or whatever.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1304080829380.25761@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I recently upgraded my Dell Latitude from Slackware-13.37/x86_64 to
-14.0/x86_64 and now .Xmodmap tells me that the commands cannot be found.
This same file is used to switch the caplock and ctrl keys. It works on
other hosts and worked on the Dell before now.  It does not run when
~/.xinitrc is invoked and when I try to manually run it every command
(remove, keysym, add) is not found. I've no idea where to start looking for
the reason it broke.

   Here's the file:

clear mod4
!
! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L
!
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Control = Control_L
keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Control_L
keysym Alt_L = Meta_L Alt_L

Pointers needed,

Rich

The only thing that comes to me is that you no longer have the
xmodmap(1) command installed.  On Fedora, at least, xmodmap and
friends are part of a package called "xorg-x11-server-utils".  If
Slackware has an analogous package, it may not have been installed
when you upgraded Slackware versions.

Your file looks almost identical to the one I have here; it should
work as long as xmodmap is installed.  The reason that the
individual commands in the file don't work is that they are not
system commands, per se.  Rather, they are instructions to the
xmodmap program itself.

Hope this helps.

Dale,

   That's not the issue. xmodmap is present and accounted for. I can run
'xmodmap .Xmodmap' from the command line and it works. For whatever reason,
the same command in ~/.xinitrc stopped working.

   I've asked on the Slackware forum on linuxquestions.org since my reading
of the man page and a Web search did not turn up any answers.

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

Could you post the content of your .xinitrc, and the specific errors that
you're seeing? It would also help to know the path to xmodmap (`which
xmodmap` should provide that).

Rogan,

   It's the default Slackware .xinitrc. The error I see is that it is not
invoked from the line 'xmodmap .Xmodmap' within the script. It works fine
from the command line. Shrug.

   There's always something.

Would you mind posting / sending the whole script? This must be either a
syntax issue in the script (possibly due to a munged merge when the slack
upgrade happened?) or an issue with the context in which the xmodmap line
is invoked.  The specific text of the errors, and the specific contents of
that script will help enormously to narrow that down.  It could be a single
quote that should be a back-quote, for example, or a space that shouldn't
exist.

I'm happy to look over the precise input/output, but I can't help debug
further without it. (modulo extensive back-and-forth that I suspect is
unnecessary).

The error output should be in ${HOME}/.xsession-errors, printed to the
console where you launch startx, or in /var/log/Xorg.<something>.log

   It's the same as on my server/workstation running Slackware-13.1.

   There ain't no error text. X is invoked and the xfce4-10 desktop displays.
But the cap lock and left ctrl key have not been switched.

   If I run the command in a v.t. the key functions are swapped.

   No .xsession-errors file. The Xorg.0.log is sent off the list (484 lines
are too much cruft for everyone else). :-)

I wonder if your .xinitrc is actually in use.  Are you using startx to
start the X server? (If you're logging in via a graphical log-in manager,
then you're probably not using the .xinitrc any longer).

I ask because the last line appears to be starting Window Maker, while you
later refer to XFCE; if you're intentionally running Window Maker as the WM
for XFCE, then that's all fine and as it should be (although I'm not
certain where XFCE is being started from).

I suspect that instead, another script is being run that is starting an
XFCE session, and your .xinitrc is no longer in the loop.

One way to check is to create a new .xinitrc that contains only:


#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/bin/xterm

then restart and start X again.  If you get nothing but an xterm, then
indeed, you're using the xinitrc.

   Shrug. I dunno.

   Yep. It's an alias for startxfce4.

   That last line has been in .xinitrc since 2002. I've no idea why, but I've
used only xfce since 1997 and that wm line has never been invoked.

   Same script, different host, works fine. It also worked fine for all
upgrades until this last one to 14.0.

   I may play with this while I'm away on a business trip. But, I'm sure
xinitrc is being read since it's always worked before.

Thanks, Rogan,

As I mentioned in another thread already, I too have seen a lot of SPAM on
the PLUG-JOBS list since the server move (none before).
I would like to keep that list, since there are at least some useful job
posts on there, but not very many.

However I just unsubscribed from the JOBS list just now, since it appears
no one who actually runs the lists seems to care about the SPAM issue.
So thanks for listening... </sarcasm>

It doesn't seem like the Jobs list gets a lot of traffic anyway. I'd be happy to help if it doesn't end up being too time consuming.

I think the easiest thing to do is to make the Jobs list a subscription
only list.  Joe asked if we should do this. People posting jobs will
understand the need to subscribe to make a post.

I cannot begin to describe what horrible news this is:

http://stumptownsyndicate.org/2013/04/09/goodbye-igal/

Just today I came across my note that Igal offered to give a talk on 
Vagrant. I also have a box of my childhood books about strange airplanes 
that I have been meaning to give him ever since he gave a great talk at 
Open Source Bridge about the weirdest of the flying weird.

His contribution to Calagator was fundamental and PLUG has reached its 
broadest audience ever thanks to this exemplary tool.

I have lost someone to use my ten phrases of Russian with at local events.

Thank you Igal for your exemplary attitude, code, community 
participation and kindness.

The global community has lost a great contributor.

Rest in peace.

Subject: [PLUG] Thinkpad DVD drive failure, maybe
Message-ID: <20130410201912.3ab5796c@Devil8>

I think the DVD drive in my Thinkpad is kaput. Actually, not the drive.
I think it is the connector in the back that the drive plugs into that
is flaky. It has been temperamental for some time. I bought a
refurbished drive that worked better at first, but now it won't work
either. I can't get anything to mount - DVD, CD, new media, nada. The
light flashes for a while, but then stops and nothing appears
in /media. I tried mount and nothing interesting appeared. I also tried
dmesg and got no clues.

Before assuming that I need to buy a new computer:

1) is there anything at the command line or otherwise that I could do
to see what is actually happening?

2) I looked at the service manual for my T61 and cannot figure out the
drawings. Is it possible to replace the connector that the optical
drive connects to? Has anyone ever been deep inside that part of a T61?

I found some info on the interweb and all of the hardware related to the
optical drive is soldered directly onto the motherboard. your
safest/cheapest bet is to find a t61 motherboard on ebay and swap them out.
if you're feeling adventurous, we can try replacing just the connector
(keith will decry my soldering skills, but they are adequate enough to get
the job done) or perhaps the controller chip if we can find it. while we
have it apart, we can thoroughly inspect the board and try to locate any
trouble spots. an intermittent functionality could indicate something as
basic as a solder joint that has come apart, or as deeply involved as a
controller chip that has failed internally and will be nearly impossible to
detect via any deterministic means - meaning the only way to figure it out
is replace something and hope it works.

Give the lsblk(8) command a try.  It should give you a display
something like this:

sr0 is my desktop's internal DVD drive.  It's empty, but still shows
the "1024M" size entry.  sr1 is a Sony portable DVD drive that
connects via USB; it has a video DVD in it.  Since sr0 is always
connected, it always has an entry.  The USB drive only shows up if
it's plugged in.  If your internal DVD doesn't show up, my guess would
be that your hardware is faulty.

Another thing you can try is watch /var/log/messages while you insert
a disk in the DVD drive.  Use "sudo tail -f /var/log/messages" at the
command line.  This will show the last few lines of the file, then
watch the file and print any new lines that get added.  Use <ctrl-c>
to exit when you're done.

Ow.  I don't have a T61, but I did have a T40 and still have a Dell
Inspiron.  In both of them the DVD drive connector is soldered
directly to the motherboard.  I imagine that the T61 is no different.
If you have a very fine-tip soldering iron, it's possible to solder a
new one on.  The fun part is taking out the old one.  The traces and
pads on a laptop's motherboard are _very_ fine and delicate.  It's all
too easy to tear them up without wanting to.  My recommendation would
be to buy another used T61 and use this one for parts.

Sorry I couldn't be of more help.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced Topics Meeting Announcement
(I am calling it a reminder because Tim brought it up at the meeting!)

Who: Timothy Bruce
What: Graphite - Scalable Realtime Graphing
Where: Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue, Portland (Left Entrance)
When: Tuesday, April 16th, 2013 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of technology freedom


Graphite - Scalable Realtime Graphing
http://graphite.wikidot.com/

This talk will be my choices as to why I selected collectd / Graphite
for performance monitoring my environment at home (email / web /
database and test systems). The discussion will include what I looked
at, why I discarded the software I did, and show some demonstrations of
Graphite, Munin, and if I can get it working again, Ganglia for a
comparison of some of their features. I will also discuss some of the
hicups I found in configuring some aspects of collectd and Graphite.

Biography

Tim Bruce has been involved in computers since 1981 when he first fell
in love with computing. He's done computer training, computer security,
programming, systems administration and data management. For the last 14
years he's worked as a Database Administrator with Sybase, SQL Server,
and PostgreSQL at employers such as Providence Health Systems, Fiserv,
FlightStats, and currently with Northwest Evaluation Association.


Many will break for the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne afterwards.

Subject: [PLUG] Weird Video Failure
Message-ID: <5166FAC1.9050005@comcast.net>

I was typing along this morning, minding my own business, when my 
machine rebooted. I have an nVidia GeForce 8400GS card that supports two 
monitors, one digital, the other analog. I use the smaller, analog 
screen (1280 x 1024) as the one with the top and bottom bars with menus 
and open program buttons, and the digital screen (1680 x 1050) for extra 
space. When the machine came back up the Ubuntu logo showed up on the 
right screen, (which is normal). Shortly after that the right screen 
went blank, and the left screen had half the wallpaper showing. I heard 
the Ubuntu two-note sound telling me that it was waiting for me to log 
in, so I logged in. I can move the cursor to the left and the rest of 
the wallpaper shifts so that it fills the screen mostly the way it used 
to. I'm thinking that somehow the driver thinks this smaller monitor has 
the real estate of the larger one, sort of.

Anyway, does this sound like the video card is failing? It's only a 
couple years old. It does have a poor bearing in the chip fan, and has 
made noise for some months, now. It's still making noise as I type, so 
I'm pretty sure the fan is still running. I can bring up the nVidia X 
Server Settings tool and see that the internal temperature is 41C. I 
haven't looked at that in the past, so I don't have a reference for 
whether that's good, bad, or indifferent.

When I look at the XServer Display Configuration it shows the digital 
screen is off. Normally it's on. The configuration is set to Twin View. 
Normally that's set to Separate X Screen.

When I click on the right hand monitor (in the tool) the resolution 
shows as off. If I change that to 1680 x 1050 and click Apply, nothing 
happens. This is what's making me think the card is failing, or at least 
part of it has failed.

Any recommendations?

Assuming the card has failed, any recommendations on a better nVidia card?

Thanks.

BTW, I set the auto save feature of LibreOffice to 1 minute, and 
recovered most of the work I was doing.

"dmesg" and /var/log/messages will give you all the gobbledygook you 
would ever want.

The connector is soldered to the motherboard.  You do not have the
connector or the tools, and replacing the whole motherboard is a 
complicated job. 

However, chances are your problem is a bit of junk on the connector
or a little corrosion, and you do not need to do nearly as much
disassembly to open up the machine and expose the connector for
cleaning.  The IBM HMM service manual describes the steps.  I will
defer to Galen or others for the best way to clean a connector.  I
usually use a pencil eraser, Q-tips, isopropyl alcohol, and a paint
brush.  Someone more skilled than I might do this just by reaching
six inches into the drive bay of the intact machine.

An even easier approach is to buy a USB2 DVD drive, and use USB
flash drives for stuff you want to move fast.  I bought a used
USB2 DVD drive for $25 at ecoBinary in Beaverton.  They may have
them at Free Geek, Green Century, and other Portland places.
New is easy, but where's the adventure in that?

You do not need to buy a new computer.  You can buy a used T61 for
$100 to $200 on eBay or Craigslist.   There are two for sale on
Portland Craigslist as I write.  Even more will come out of the
woodwork on Craigslist if you post a "wanted" request, especially
with people scrambling for money to pay taxes, or who have
imprudently pre-spent their anticipated refund.  When you buy a
Craigslist machine, bring an Ubuntu Live CD for testing, and run
a minute or two of the memory test, first.

Most of the newer Thinkpads, even the business-class machines, are not
as sturdy as the old ones.  I like to keep a couple of backup spares
of the laptops I use, along with spare keyboards (which I wear out),
a spare hard drive, and plenty of AC adapters and docking stations.
All this stuff is way cheaper for 5 year old designs, and it will
last practically forever on a shelf.

The best part of keeping identical spare laptops with Linux is that
moving hard drives takes minutes.   If the hardware and graphics
drivers are the same, this Just Works, unlike the mother-may-I mac
and windoze serial-number-sensitive crap.  It takes me longer to
modify the MAC ethernet hardware address in my DHCP server tables.

If you do backups properly, you can even clone a new hard-drive
from them, so you can clone a whole machine from last night's backup
and be up to speed in a few hours at most, after the complete loss
of your working machine.

Fixing a hardware problem in Linux is much easier than proprietary
OSes, and mastery of your own hardware brings the same satisfaction
as mastering your OS does.  If you can fix a house, you can learn 
to fix a laptop.

Hello,

Rumor has it that various people have offered to be PLUG Job list

Moderation using wetware rather than software is probably best in this case.

Drop me a line if you are interested in this responsibility.

It might be worth trying a new DVD drive. If this Amazon listing is to
be believed, ref
www.amazon.com/IBM-Geninue-Original-Ultrabay-Thinkpad/dp/B0026M6NNS , a
new OEM drive is $32.

Otherwise, I might go for a new laptop, or perhaps a refurb T410.

Thanks,
Mike

We now have two moderators and Joe and myself on to make sure things are 
working.

As for anyone at PLUG caring, there are two distinct possibilities:

1. We could not care less about spam.

2. I personally am a volunteer who had a child in December and spoke at 
an open source conference in Tokyo just prior to the server move and 
manage two family businesses, not to mention PLUG with the goal of 
having international conference-class speakers twice a month.

Thanks to all who responded.

I already tried a new drive, and it doesn't work any better. Hence my
conclusion that it is the connector. 

A USB drive is a stopgap, but I usually need an optical drive when
away from home, and having to schlep another piece of hardware around
is something I'd prefer to avoid.

I think the thing to do is wait until the Clinic on the 21st. With help
from Keith (who has been inside many Thinkpads) and Wes, we will see if
it is just dirt, or a broken connection. Keith's suggestion that is
dirt has certainly already occurred to me. I used a can of compressed
air on it without success. But I couldn't really get the air pointed
directly where it needs to be without disassembling the shell, so it
could still be dirt. 

I do lust for a faster computer. This one is five years old, the CPU
cannot be upgraded enough to make much difference, I've already
maxed out the RAM, and the hard disk is the fastest I can buy for it.
Scribus can sometimes be glacial when I am working on large files. On
the other hand, to get what I want, complete with dock and accessories,
would cost over $2,000. Yet, if I get a new computer it will pretty much
force a new installation, clearing out five years of accumulated junk
from multiple dist-upgrades. That's good, even if it will take me a
week to get all my stuff reinstalled. However, I don't want to embark
on that enterprise until the middle of June when classes are over.

Decisions, decisions. I'll wait and see what we find at the Clinic,
then make a decision.

Thank you every who participated in the PLUG JOBS System Administration 
pre-application process.

At the request of Portland's top three recruitment firms, we disabled 
the spam filtering on the PLUG JOBS mailing list to assess each 
candidate's ability to implement spam filtering best practices including 
the deployment of:

OpenBSD spamd
SpamAssassin
GMail pass-thru

Candidates who were not able to implement these basic client-side spam 
mitigation techniques are kindly asked to refrain from responding to 
system administration jobs posted the the PLUG JOBS mailing list, of 
which there are many.

Thank you for your participation!

For realz? This was a job test for Portland's top three recruitment
firms? Cool!

On a related issue, the company that I joined a few months back
(ForgeRock) is doing more hiring. 

What is the protocol for posting such jobs?

Thanks,
Mike

A 256GB  SSD drive can make an old laptop leap to life. Most slowness in
laptops is not because of a bottleneck for CPU time, but  a bottleneck
accessing the disk.  The SSD will not fix your DVD problem, but it will
make Scribus run faster.

Post to the jobs list. It is now moderated.

I apologize that a few folks were subject to my wrath but I wish to 
address the golden rule of open source:

Do not criticize a volunteer effort unless it is explicitly harmful

Should someone have an urgent PLUG-related concern, CALL ME.

My phone number will remain on the site until abused. If you don't know 
me, find someone who you think knows me or ask around. You can also mail 
me directly but as demonstrated, complaining on the list will do very 
little. I can find plenty at fault with PLUG any contribution of mine to 
it but I also have reason to believe that for a zero cost effort with 
near-zero overhead that has provided many people jobs, it provides a 
good value via good venues.

Or I am completely and utterly missing something.

Michael

If this computer could only hold more than one drive I would leap at an
SSD drive. But I currently have a 320 GB drive, and it is not big
enough. I am always trying to figure out how to reconfigure things to
make space. For the price of a 320 GB SSD drive I could buy a lot of
new computer power.

There exists a hybrid 500 GB drive with a small SSD part. I considered
it, but 1) it is very expensive and 2) my Thinkpad's SATA 2 controller
is locked to 100 MB/s performance by the BIOS (bad, bad decision by
Lenovo), so a faster drive would be unlikely to help.

But the decision remains on hold until after the Clinic. Crossing my
fingers that this computer can be saved. :)

Hello all,

Russell raised the point that people should not hesitate to seek help if 
they believe they are suffering from depression.

I have asked him, Keith (medical informatics talk) and Oregon 
Psychological Association for suggestions for speakers who might be 
enlightened on this topic as it applies to the open source community.

Please contact me directly if you also know of someone who may fit the 
bill. Obviously, experience with the community or the tech field is a 
plus and I hope there are more than a handful of such specialists.

I don't think you were out of line at all.  The PLUG-JOBS mailing definitely
took a big uptick in spam with the transition to the new server.  Not sure
what got lost in translation, but it was dramatic.  I recall that Wil set
some very aggressive anti-spam goals for himself in the past (no spam, but
no false positives either), so perhaps we were benefiting as a by-product of
living in his server world.

That technical issue aside, though, I think the complainer was out of line
in tone and attitude. More importantly, they failed to recognize the amazing
amount of effort you and others contribute to PLUG, and how much is required
to make it all happen.  I think you were right to speak up.  I had a lead
role in a similar organization a few years ago (and did miserably), so I
speak from experience.  

I appreciate everything you do for us.  PLUG just keeps getting better, and
these days I attribute that directly to you.  Thank you, Michael.

Message-ID: <CALYotC=sdRNxnmQZh7JijSqXUN-g3JSPEr_J3Vogo9MQfUvKsw@mail.gmail.com>

My wife, who has been using a MacBook (now almost 7 years old), has decided
she'd like her next notebook to use Linux Ubuntu. I've been using it for
years and been happy with it, and have installed Ubuntu on both a laptop
and a desktop. Dual booting with Windows might be useful but not at all
necessary - neither us have any plans to use Windows on the machine. The
question now, in these days of Windows 8 and UEFI, is, what would be a good
notebook to use, and whether dual booting is even much practical, or
whether getting a machine with no OS or one with Ubuntu pre-installed would
be a good idea. Preferably in somewhere near PDX, though we're open to
shipping. Budget runs up to $600 or so.

Today we picked up a Lenovo ideapad Z585, which I was told ought to work
for dual booting. But that's been a generic statement, and information
about making it happen has been spotty. Until I'm confident of an Ubuntu
install the box will not be opened. Indications via web searching so far
are mixed. (I don't care to pay the $70+ restocking fee imposed once the
box is opened.) If I can't so satisfy myself, it goes back to the store.
I've been googling the subject, and comments on dual booting w/Windows 8
(and UEFI), from the Ubuntu site and elsewhere, seem to be all over the
map. Any thoughts, or this machine or others?

Thank you Brian but as per the PLUG bylaws, I WILL gladly refund any 
dissatisfied PLUG members their annual dues amortized with 25% interest 
starting at their first date of participation.

All payments will be made in Bitcoin or Belarusian rubles as per the 
preferences selected on the member's PLUG account management page.

Have a great weekend!

Thank you everyone who has volunteered to occupy the booth at past

or for the first time.

Given the limited availability of booths, should PLUG receive one, I 
welcome other local groups to provide brochures, stickers and the like

The response will be in May and let's hope for the best!

For whitebox high-end laptops i've been pretty happy with Sager/Clevo -
you can get them without any OS and spec the disk, video, etc. They also
have more budget-oriented modles that look good. The two i've owned during
the last 6-7 years have been real workhorses, but on the bulky side.

My next machine will likely be a System76 or ZaReason. Both companies
specialize in preloading Ubuntu, and their laptop lines seem pretty
comparable (they include models more or less in your price range). Wife &
i have a System76 netbook that's lovely - the System76 folks are great for
both purchase and support. My wife had used Mac and windows machines
previously, she had no problem transitioning to Ubuntu 10.04.

re: dual-booting: VirtualBox works fine for me for the few Windows apps i
rely on.

Hey everyone,

I want to publicly apologize to Michael for my rant earlier.
I consider it a frustrated venting, not really criticizing his efforts.

As it apparently was taken as criticism, and I had not intended it to be,
then I own up to my bad attitude and apologize for it.

Michael does a great job with this group and is to be commended.

While I have not been very active with PLUG in person, I was a lot more
active with OCLUG in California when I lived there, so I know what it takes
to run a volunteer organization.  I am also a Fedora Ambassador (sans the
bad attitude, of course).  It is just lately having been unemployed for a
while now, I had to vent.  Wrong place for it.
I will be resubscribing to the jobs list, though since I pooched it I guess
I won't get any good leads from there myself, but anyway...

So at any rate, I intend to be at OSCON to help with the Fedora booth, and
if a PLUG booth does indeed happen and you need more staff, I am willing to
help there.
As long as you don't mind a PLUG rep wearing a Fedora blue shirt and bright
RedHat red hat... <grin>.

Peace.

Ubuntu supports UEFI.... The developer who added that support lives

I'm a fan of Dell Hardware and like their new XPS 13 (Ubuntu
pre-installed) although thats out of the range you suggested... That
being said I have also tried out System76 and love their Pangolin
notebook.

HA! Open source is new territory and one will pooch things all the time

You would get either NO display or a garbled/distorted etc display if
your card is failing.  Since X comes up, the card is probably fine
(unless you just lost the DVI port...). Sounds like you are the victim
of a Ubuntu drive-by update.  If using proprietary Nvidia drivers, this
can be an issue.  What can happen is that the Nvidia kernel driver
doesn't load (depends on kernel version) so Ubuntu switched to nouveau
and your monitor autodetection is all screwy.

I would update the Nvidia driver, reboot, then reset the settings.

Using the Nvidia X server Settings tool, "X Server Display
Configuration" - "Advanced" button, see if you can set up the monitors
like you had before (run it via sudo or as root).  Then save the
settings to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/xorg.conf

Remember to pay attention to the following entries:

Position
Viewport Out
Panning

next select the monitors on at a time, and see which one is
[x] make this the primary display for the X screen.

I also recommend using Twinview over separate X screens as it makes
setup easier.

I use a 24" LCD 1920x1080 as primary and a 17" Dell Trinitron as a
secondary via twinview.  Autodetection tends to make things jump around
so I built and saved a full features xorg.conf and now everything stays
where I put 'em!

HI

I know this isn't the Windows support group.

But, someone may know the answer..

Once a year, for the past 5  years, I fire  up an old computer with Win 2K
on it and run TaxAct.  It is a wonderful free program that runs on
Windows..  Have been using it for 5  years.  I can't find a free Federal
Tax Program on Linux..

Anyway..

This year I had to buy a new printer..  And the new printer does not work
with Win 2K...

So I tried to copy the file to a flash/thumb drive.  Every time I do that
the computer reboots..  Will not copy the file...

TaxAct claims it is not their fault..  No funny stuff on the file or
program.

Also, the program will NOT save the program anywhere but the original
location...


Now this may sound crazy to you.. I agree....  I need a hard copy of my tax
return..

Haven't tried to send it to myself... Maybe that will work..

Or if anyone has any idea I would be grateful..

I fell really bad having to admin I use Win 2K for tax...

Is there a good Linux tax program I should use NEXT year?

TIA

I use TaxAct every year. No shame there. I admit I haven't used Win2K in over 
10 years, though.

I'm not sure what problem you're trying to solve. What file are you trying to 
copy to the flash drive? What program won't save what program somewhere?

I don't know of any Linux tax preparation programs but there are tons of
web-based tax preparation programs out there. The IRS maintains a list
here:

	http://www.revenue.wi.gov/eserv/webased.html

I don't know which ones will make a printout of the forms they create
or which ones are free. I use a very expensive but super easy program
called "take the shoeboxes of junk to my CPA."

In case you still want to use Tax Act, have you tried printing to file?
You do have a working printer installed on the Windows 2000 computer,
right? Most printer drivers on Windows 2000 have a print to file
option. This will create a .prn file, which is what Windows 2000 names
a Postscript file. On Linux you can open a .prn file with Evince or
Okular, and probably other document viewers, but most importantly,
just can send it to the printer with lpr or lpr. I assume there is a
DOS command that is the equivalent of lp or lpr. 

What happens when you try to print from Tax Act?

I'll cast a vote for using online tax prep software and TaxAct was recommended
in a round about way:
    Antitrust enforcers look at more than just price when they are deciding
    whether to block a deal. They blocked H&R Block's acquisition of a
    company that made TaxACT tax software.

    "This TaxACT story is really what we call a maverick story," says Fiona
    Scott Morton, another former antitrust regulator.

    Like H&R Block and Intuit, TaxACT had free software you could use to
    file your federal tax return. Unlike H&R Block and Intuit, the Justice
    Department argued, TaxACT made a real effort to make its free version
    a product customers would really want to use.

    Aggressively giving away a product that other companies are charging
    for makes a company a maverick. That's good for competition, Morton says.

    "The maverick is helping consumers by disrupting this tacit understanding
    and coordination among the big firms not to compete too hard," she
    says. "The maverick is breaking that up and really benefiting consumers."

A company that upsets the apple cart and then fights of acquisition?  Sounds
great.

That quote is from the Planet Money podcast:
http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/02/15/171955074/mavericks-hot-documents-and-beer

Yeah, a story about beer monopolies.

Are we talking about the same TaxAct the we use every year with an 
Ubuntu 10.04 machine?  We use it online and print out the copies for 
archive purposes.  Our taxes are not complicated, perhaps there is a 
difference there.  FWIW, we have had no issues using their program that way.

- Once your get xserver config sorted out I'd recommend getting into the
habit of creating a backup of the xorg.conf file and keeping a copy of it
my home directory and/or thumb drive. When  I used to run Ubuntu I had more
problems with xserver than I care to admit and this practice saved me hours
of frustration.

Long story. I'll try to give the short version.

In trying to get rid of the noise coming from the fan I followed some 
directions I found on the web. That involved removing the fan from the 
heat sink, peeling back the cover from the fan bearing, administering a 
tiny bit of 3-in-1 oil, and reversing the removal process. The last step 
was to plug the fan connector back into the board. I noticed a small, 
black piece of plastic. Turns out it was one of the fan blades. Sigh.

Went to ENU and got an EVGA GeForce 210. The board looks nearly 
identical to my old GS 8400. Specs show that it has 1GB memory instead 
of the 512 MB on the old board.

Put the new board in the machine. It booted up with the same problem -- 
initial Ubuntu splash screen on the DVI monitor, screen goes blank -- 
VGA monitor comes up with the image shifted to the left. Drag the image 
back to the right, log in. So, I'm back to where I was before busting 
the fan on the old board.

Following your recommendation I removed the nVidia current driver, 
powered down, powered back up. With the driver gone both monitors come 
up with the same image. Reinstalled the nVidia current driver. (I 
removed and re installed the driver using the Ubuntu Software Center.)

Ran sudo usr/bin/nvidia-settings. The XServer Display Configuration 
Layout shows the left monitor resolution (1280x1024). The right monitor 
is shown as Samsung SyncMaster (Off). When I click on it the Resolution 
drop-down shows Off. I can change it to 1680x1050, and it changes in the 
Layout display, but the monitor remains off. I click on Apply, the left 
monitor goes blank for a second or so, and then comes back. The right 
monitor remains off.

I just noticed (as I'm typing this) that the Position drop-down shows 
Absolute followed by +1280+0. I changed it to Right of, clicked Apply, 
and the right monitor reappeared. Then I returned it to Absolute, 
clicked apply, still have the wallpaper as expected, and the box to the 
right of the Position drop-down again filled in with +1280+0.

Yes.

Done.

Yes. Both screens are set for Absolute. The left one has an offset of 
+0+0, and the right one +1280+0, which makes sense.

Yes. The left screen is 1280x1024, and the right one is 1680x1050.

The left one, which is what I want.

Now that I'm going through it again I see that TwinView is what I had 
before. Not sure why I thought I was using Separate X screens.

I saved this e-mail as a draft, did a restart, and everything is back to 
normal -- no more blank right hand screen and the image shifted to the 
left on the left hand screen.

Thanks for the advice. I'll be saving a copy of this e-mail in my 
machine log, just in case something like this happens again.

Glad to help.  Its for your issue that I still run a full xorg.conf like
in the "old" days.  That, and Slackware, of course ;-)

Also, forgot to mention /var/log/Xorg.0.log as checking that can often
tell you what modes are being "autodetected" as well as any warnings of
errors.

Enjoy!

Interesting log. It appears to really want me to know that CRT-1 and 
DFP-0 do "support NVIDIA 3D Vision stereo." Well, I have no idea what  
NVIDIA 3D Vision stereo is, so I won't take it personally. ;-)

Thanks, again, for your help.

In past years I provided a home-made banner that I created by taping
together 12 x 18 sheets (the largest my big printer can handle). But at
last year's OSCON Michael showed up with some cool pictures and stuff
that he did at (Costco?) for a cheap price. 

It would be a good idea to have a really nice PLUG banner. I'll spring
for the money and even go get it done if someone can confirm where the
cheap places are.

There is a company in Tigard that will do full size color booth banners for
under $100 I can't remember the exist price... I think they are Portland
Banner Co but I could be confusing the name.

For ink jet color photo printing, Costco can't be beat.

I still have the vertical poster and we all could consider a horizontal 
one but... what would it say? :)

Let's see if the booth is approved.

Definitely a hardware problem. Confirmed today. OK, we already knew it
was a hardware problem, but now I have additional information.

Today I had to reboot the computer for various reasons, and when it
came up I decided to try the DVD drive. It worked! That is, it worked
for mounting about five DVDs and copying some files off of them. Then,
while inserting another DVD I was suddenly staring at the Thinkpad boot
splash screen. After it rebooted it worked again for several DVDs and
then the screen froze, followed a few moments later by a black screen
and the Thinkpad boot splash screen.

A few weeks ago I asked here about problems that could cause a random
reboot. I guess I just found out what was causing it. :)

I don't know if it can be fixed, but I now know for a fact that
something is haywire with the drive, and most likely the connector.
We'll find out next Sunday.

It could be you don't have a hardware problem. It could still be a software
problem.
You might have something that runs automatically when you insert a DVD and
that could be causing the occasional crash.
I don't know what that something is on your system because it varies with
distribution. XFCE I think uses something called Thunar to configure this
behavior.
If you have something like that running you could temporarily turn it off
and see if your problem disappears.

Subject: [PLUG] Unexpected machine reboot
Message-ID: <516C4668.5080503@comcast.net>

Like last Thursday my machine rebooted itself while I was working. No 
warning. Just a reboot. Unlike last Thursday, when the login screen 
appeared it was normal -- not the blank right hand screen and shifted 
left hand screen. This leads me to believe that last Thursday there may 
have been more than one problem, the video one having been fixed over 
the weekend with the re-installation of the nVidia driver, and the new 
EVGA card.

I looked in /var/log/Xorg.0.log, but it just shows how it booted up 
after the unexpected reboot.

Is it likely any log would show what caused the reboot, and if so, which 
one?

If it matters, this is Ubuntu 12.04. The programs open at the time were 
Thunderbird, Firefox, Nautilus, Skype for Linux, VirtualBox with USB 
support running Win 2k running Express Scribe, another instance of 
Nautilus, LibreOffice Calc, and LibreOffice Writer.

Thanks for any clues.

Subject: [PLUG] question about nanosleep() call behavior
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHdeR0Sa4WK688LbfURfo7sc00VK6R3DfYc9AvWovAjvHQ@mail.gmail.com>

During the day, I have programs running which make literally hundreds
of thousands of timestamps.  There were noticeable glitches in the
regular timestamps, in some cases, the stamp was delayed by 0.4 to 0.5
seconds, an enormously long time by computer standards.

I wrote a test program which is the heart of the timestamp loop and
ran it for over 7 hours yesterday evening, and found that I had 76
gaps in time.  One noticeable segment seemed to occur with high system
activity, it had 7 or 8 gaps clustered together in about 3 or 4
seconds.

Apparently this is traceable to the nanosleep() call not returning
from the set interval, but at a later time, apparently held up by
signal handlers.  (my current impression)

As the manual says, "If the call is interrupted by a signal handler,
nanosleep() returns -1, sets errno to EINTR and writes the remaining
time into the structure pointed to by rem unless rem in NULL.  The
value of *rem can then be used to call nanosleep() again and complete
the specified pause."

Unfortunately, nanosleep is coming back live but after a long delay,
in my case, as shown by the timestamps.

Do I interpret the manual to suggest that nanosleep is being suddenly
terminated, and I should call it again?  My initial impression is that
nanosleep is being delayed, not suddenly terminated.

I guess I have to put some more code in that timestamp checking
program to catch the err and see what happened.  It would be very nice
to have an uninterruptable timer call.

Subject: [PLUG] rsync overwrote newer files
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1304151546330.21307@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I was under the impression that rsync did not overwrite a newer file with
an older file, but that's what just happened. I'd like to understand what I
did incorrectly so I can avoid this mistake in the future.

   While I was on a business trip last week I created new files in a
subdirectory on the laptop. Wanting to copy them to the equivalent
subdirectory on my workstation I cd'd to the appropriate laptop subdirectory
and issued this command:

 	rsync -avz * salmo:documents/workshop-presentations/nada-talk/

and expected only those files not in the workstation subdirectory to be
copied. However, not only were those files copied, but two older files (the
.lyx and .pdf for the presentation) overwrote the newer ones.

   What rsync syntax error did I commit?

Sounds like you wanted the --update option:

 -u, --update                skip files that are newer on the receiver

So if machine A has these files:

1
2
3
4

... and machine B has these files:

1
2

... and you run this on machine A:

rsync -avz --update * ${B}:documents/workshop-presentations/nada-talk/

... files 3 and 4 will be copied from A to B.  And files 1 and 2 will
be copied from A only if they have a timestamp newer than those on B.

Just be careful as this assumes that machines A and B are sync'ed to
the same time.

Robert,

   Oh. I don't recall using that option before; perhaps I've forgotten that I
did add the 'u' to the option string when I've done this in the past.

   Well, the source file time stamps are last Friday and the destination file
time stamps are today so this should not be an issue.

Many thanks,

NTP can be your friend. I've seen huge amounts of borkage because of clock
drift, and some distros that don't enable it by default, so machines are
off by 8-12 hours(!) after only a couple of weeks.

Ronabop,

   ntpd runs on the laptop as well as on the server/workstation. And, as I
wrote, the laptop files were from last Friday while the workstation files
are from today. Clock drift should not be greater than 3 days. :-)

Subject: [PLUG] followup note on nanosleep()
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHeA170CZxt6_aaYhGHOXW5dn=t75CpOg=TngBfZ5FedZg@mail.gmail.com>

I carefully added extra error capture code to the timestamping
routine, nanosleep is always returning with a good "0" status.  What
is unusual is that sometimes it doesn't return when it is supposed to,
the system seems to place it on the shelf for awhile, then eventually
get back to it, sometimes 0.5 seconds later than it is supposed to.

Has anyone come across this problem before?  I am running 12 cores 64
bit smp, Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS.

In my experience, rsync is best for one-way file system
synchronizations (i.e., mirroring).  If both file systems are likely
to change (e.g., a desktop and laptop that both see frequent use),
then I highly recommend Unison.

    http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/
    
    Unison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. It allows
    two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored
    on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified
    separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes
    in each replica to the other.

It's one more tool to learn, but is well worth it if this sort of
situation occurs regularly.

   Thanks, Paul. I daily use rsync in my dirvish backups but had the
apparently incorrect impression that it synchronized files in two locations
by updating only the older one with the newer one. I suppose that's because
I've used jpilot for many years to syncrhonize my Palm Pilots/Treos with the
desktop and that's a two-way process.

Graphite - Scalable Realtime Graphing
http://graphite.wikidot.com/

This talk will be my choices as to why I selected collectd / Graphite
for performance monitoring my environment at home (email / web /
database and test systems). The discussion will include what I looked
at, why I discarded the software I did, and show some demonstrations of
Graphite, Munin, and if I can get it working again, Ganglia for a
comparison of some of their features. I will also discuss some of the
hicups I found in configuring some aspects of collectd and Graphite.

Biography

Tim Bruce has been involved in computers since 1981 when he first fell
in love with computing. He's done computer training, computer security,
programming, systems administration and data management. For the last 14
years he's worked as a Database Administrator with Sybase, SQL Server,
and PostgreSQL at employers such as Providence Health Systems, Fiserv,
FlightStats, and currently with Northwest Evaluation Association.


Many will break for the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne afterwards.

Take a look at
/var/log/messages
/var/log/syslog

the reboot could be (1) thermal (overheating) (2) hardware issue: cpu,
mobo, add on card...

At this pt, I'd check over heating since you had a lot of stuff
running. You can check cpu and mobo temps etc with any number of
utilities. You can use BOINC (seti at home etc) as a stress test.

Is the CPU heatsink loose? When was the last time you reseated it with
fresh thermal paste?

Good luck.
Ed

I don't seem to have /var/log/messages on Ubuntu 12.04. I have dmesg. 
When I run it with the -T option I see messages that begin with the time 
the system rebooted. I tried unzipping dmesg.1.gz, but that doesn't show 
time stamps. Is there some way to see the time stamps from the 
dmesg.x.gz files?

syslog.2 has several of these cron.hourly entries before this one. It 
looks like 11:06:42 is when the machine rebooted.

The video card is the only add on card in the machine. The nVidia X 
Server Settings tool shows the temperature fluctuating between 46 and 46 
degrees C. From other reading I've done, folks don't seem to get worried 
until that temp runs up to 90 something C.

Now something seems to be wrong with the Ubuntu Software Center tool. I 
tried installing Psensor to look at the CPU temp. The progress bar is 
just about halfway, but the install is hung. There doesn't seem to be a 
way to halt the installation. Quitting the Ubuntu Software Center tool 
doesn't stop the install process. I tried ps ax, but can't tell which 
process to kill.

I'll have to check that, but I don't think so.

Never. I haven't heard of this being recommended/necessary.

Oops. There was a separate window waiting to be acknowledged. I don't 
know why it showed up behind another open window, but I just noticed it 
in the collection of buttons at the bottom of the screen. Once 
acknowledged the install completed.

However, Psensor doesn't show the CPU temperature, just the hard drive 
temp (31), the nVidia card temp (48), and the cpu usage (11, 12%).

GKrellM will show you the cpu temperature, along with a large number
of other statistics.

It only shows disk temp and GPU temp. Is it possible that my Gateway 
E-4500D doesn't report cpu temp?

It would be odd not to have CPU temp on a board less than 10yrs old.
All in p4 and Athlon days had temp sensors for CPU overtemp detection
so that could shut down/reboot if overheating.

Can you get into the BIOS settings a see if there are temp readings?
And voltage too. If under volt then maybe power supply problem?

Yes, I can get at the BIOS settings. I'll shut down a little later and

Yeah, the Ubuntu devs decided that /var/log/messages was a waste
of space so they removed it, apparently without telling anyone,
and without putting some sort of backwards compatibility in place.
However, it can be restored; see message two in this thread:

It should; it's modern enough.  Do you have lm-sensors installed and
running?  GKrellM wants that so that it can find the sensor stats.

Synaptic shows lm-sensors is installed.

sensors returns No sensors found!

sensors-detect runs but hangs the whole machine -- at least the mouse 
and keyboard -- when it tries to read the nVidia temperature.

While I was rebooting I took a look at the BIOS settings. There was no 
mention of temperature or voltage. The closest thing was in Advance -> 
Boot Configuration where I found these:

     CPU Fan Control <Enable>
     System Fan Control <Enable>
     Lowest Fan Speed <Slow>

modprobe doesn't see lm-sensors.

Okay, I've done some googling, and found a few things.  According to
Gateway's web site[1], the motherboard in your box is an Intel
D945GPBG1.  The lm-sensors web site[2] has a config file[3] for the
Intel D945GCLF.  These should be close enough to get things to work.
Read the man page for sensors.conf(5), and maybe sensors3.conf(5) to
learn where it should go.

[1] <http://support.gateway.com/s/PC/E4500/1008764/1008764cl2.shtml>
[2] <http://www.lm-sensors.org/>
[3] <http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/Configurations/Intel/D945GCLF>

My understanding is that lm-sensors is not a kernel module _per
se_.  Rather, it talks to modules already in the kernel in order
to read the data out of the various hardware info & control chips.
So it wouldn't show up in an lsmod listing.

Hope this helps.

Bill:

Thanks for this note, I may be forced to go this route.  Following a
personal tip by Paul Hermann on using the "chrt" command to set the
real time attributes, I thought I had the problem solved by using the
"SCHED_FIFO" with 99 priority, but this morning, when my Ubuntu
12.04.2 LTS system ran the daily anacron job, the system suspended the
nanosleep process again for about 0.06 seconds, which was enough to
throw off the timestamping.  I now have the anacron running at 12
midnight to 1 am, not at 7 - 8 am in the morning, right when the
system is busiest!

I have worked on kernels, I find it rather surprising that nanosleep
at SCHED_FIFO priority 99 for a current existing task, is still taken
out and laid on the shelf.  It seems okay to delay new tasks, but to
ignore an existing task at the highest schedule priority seems rather
odd.

Yes, lm_sensors uses libsensors to expose sensor kernel modules to
various apps.  Some apps don't use it and read the data directly from
/proc/*

Make sure you have libsensors installed.  It drives me nuts that Debian
and clones split packages into <name> and <name>-dev. Idiots.

Yes, his can happen when it probes for incompatible sensors, or chips
that advertise as a sensor but are not. For nvidia, you need to read the
temp with:

nvidia-settings -q GPUCoreTemp -t

NOTE: you do not usually run sensors-detect in a terminal with X active.
Get thee to a proper command line!

Until we can read the CPU temp, we can skip this for now. Yes: heat
sinks do come loose OFTEN. I've had to reseat them after cross country
moves. Or when I overclock due to a wicked gaming addiction...

That mobo is a 945G chipset with ICH7- very common and very well Linux
supported, iirc. ICH7 is the I/O chip and should be similar to the ICH5
and ICH9 I have floating around (I do mostly AMD style and Slackware...)
"lsmod" should show something similar to:

Module                  Size  Used by
lm85                   14453  0
hwmon_vid               2304  1 lm85
i915                  372988  1
processor              23020  0
thermal_sys            12122  2 processor,video
hwmon                   1033  2 thermal_sys,lm85
i2c_algo_bit            4543  1 i915
i2c_i801                6952  0
i2c_core               16454  6 i2c_i801, i2c_algo_bit, drm, \
drm_kms_helper, i915, lm85

Now, "lm85" was detected by sensors-detect for my thermal chip, and I
added it via /etc/modprobe.d as it is not autodetected. You will have a
different one.  "i915" for on-board video since this a small server.
The rest should be similar to yours.

hwmon, processor (or something related to CPU), i2c_core (linked to
i2c_*) are absolutely essential.  i2c_801 is for my mobo, there shodl be
something similar for yours.

Now, note also that sensors-detect will try to load some modules, such
as "i2c-dev" and "cpuid" so these must be present in your kernel modules
package. Once everything is loaded, using the default config files, run
"sensors -s" ONCE as root (or *ugh* sudo) and then you can run "sensors"
to display all the goodies.

To summarize your reboot issue:

1. Something fishy with your Ubuntu install - or Canonical buggered your
kernel (no messages or syslog? The Horror!)
2. CPU or chipset overheating

AND..we haven't even gotten to these yet:

3. Bad power supply. lm_sensors will read the voltages.....or sheck with
voltmeter.
4. Bad RAM.  One module may be flaky.  Clean or swap.

Easy check of RAM: Pull them out, check for discoloration, deformities
on the chips.  Dust out the sockets with compressed air.  Then clean the
RAM module pins either with a PCB cleaner, or rub gently with a rubber
eraser. I use a Staedtler Mars Plastic eraser brick Ive had for decades.
Firmly but carefully reseat the modules.

If you are local, this might be a task for PLUGs Sunday Q&A if there is
one this week.

Have fun.
Ed

re: my prior email to this list

Dick S.,

the lsmod command should list i2c_801 as one of your modules for your
chipset.  Now that I dug a bit more... Intel 945G sensors support
might still be problematic.

What gets me is that I can't seem to locate any BIOS configuration
info.  yikes.

Message-ID: <CAJeYwHeoZi8bpAceysUE940mKFuyq=uAJP-vw+eOOxmeKR5dbA@mail.gmail.com>

I think this is probably the correct explanation of why nanosleep went
to sleep too long...

Priority inheritance for in-kernel spinlocks and semaphores

Realtime programmers are often concerned about priority inversion,
which can happen as follows:

    Low-priority task A acquires a resource, for example, a lock.

    Medium-priority task B starts executing CPU-bound, preempting
low-priority task A.

    High-priority task C attempts to acquire the lock held by
low-priority task A, but blocks because of medium-priority task B
having preempted low-priority task A.

Such priority inversion can indefinitely delay a high-priority task.
There are two main ways to address this problem: (1) suppressing
preemption and (2) priority inheritance. In the first case, since
there is no preemption, task B cannot preempt task A, preventing
priority inversion from occurring. This approach is used by PREEMPT
kernels for spinlocks, but not for semaphores. It does not make sense
to suppress preemption for semaphores, since it is legal to block
while holding one, which could result in priority inversion even in
absence of preemption. For some realtime workloads, preemption cannot
be suppressed even for spinlocks, due to the impact to scheduling
latencies.

Priority inheritance can be used in cases where suppressing preemption
does not make sense. The idea here is that high-priority tasks
temporarily donate their high priority to lower-priority tasks that
are holding critical locks. This priority inheritance is transitive:
in the example above, if an even higher priority task D attempted to
acquire a second lock that high-priority task C was already holding,
then both tasks C and A would be be temporarily boosted to the
priority of task D. The duration of the priority boost is also sharply
limited: as soon as low-priority task A releases the lock, it will
immediately lose its temporarily boosted priority, handing the lock to
(and being preempted by) task C.

However, it may take some time for task C to run, and it is quite
possible that another higher-priority task E will try to acquire the
lock in the meantime. If this happens, task E will "steal" the lock
from task C, which is legal because task C has not yet run, and has
therefore not actually acquired the lock. On the other hand, if task C
gets to run before task E tries to acquire the lock, then task E will
be unable to "steal" the lock, and must instead wait for task C to
release it, possibly boosting task C's priority in order to expedite
matters.

In addition, there are some cases where locks are held for extended
periods. A number of these have been modified to add "preemption
points" so that the lock holder will drop the lock if some other task
needs it. The JBD journaling layer contains a couple of examples of
this.

It turns out that write-to-reader priority inheritance is particularly
problematic, so PREEMPT_RT simplifies the problem by permitting only
one task at a time to read-hold a reader-writer lock or semaphore,
though that task is permitted to recursively acquire it. This makes
priority inheritance doable, though it can limit scalability.

man libsensors reports no manual entry for libsensors.

Synaptic shows libsensors4 is installed but not libsensors4-dev.

After installing libsensors4-dev I get a man page for libsensors, but 
that didn't change the output of lsmod.

Very Strange!  There should be SOMETHING related to hardware monitoring.

Do you have those kernel module entries in the following directories
(your kernel version WILL differ):
/lib/modules/3.2.29/kernel/drivers/acpi
/lib/modules/3.2.29/kernel/drivers/hwmon
/lib/modules/3.2.29/kernel/drivers/i2c
/lib/modules/3.2.29/kernel/drivers/thermal

Its been awhile since I had a mobo with your chipset, but I do
remember that I had some data via lm_sensors and gkrellm

No worries. I think I enjoy troubleshooting and fiddling more than
actually using these damn gadgets!

If you want to schlep your box to the Clinic, let me know [kingbeowulf

troubleshoot.

Thanks. I'll see what else it going on and try to get out of that so I

Man pages might be described as the "CliffsNotes" version of 
what I'm looking for.
"Three ladies make stew prior to guilt plagued murderer 
vainly attempts to wash hands" may summarize "Macbeth".
But ;)

My immediate symptom, having installed two configurations of 
Debian I wish to chose between them with a menu.

As a first step I attempted to modify the automatically 
created lilo.conf to display the menu (admittedly it will 
only have one entry to chose from at this point). I 
uncommented the line containing "install=menu" and then ran 
"lilo". It did not display a menu on the next boot. The menu 
code code itself is functional as I can display the menu if 
fast enough with the space-bar when LILO starts.

Another question lurking is what should be considered when 
choosing to place LILO in MBR or the partition in which the 
OS is being installed.

   Here is a condensed version of /etc/lilo.conf from this host:

-----------------------------------------------------
# LILO configuration file
# generated by 'liloconfig'
#
# Start LILO global section
# Append any additional kernel parameters:
append=" vt.default_utf8=0"
boot = /dev/sda
lba32

# Wait until the timeout to boot (if commented out, boot the
# first entry immediately):
prompt
# Timeout before the first entry boots.
# This is given in tenths of a second, so 600 for every minute:
timeout = 1200
# Override dangerous defaults that rewrite the partition table:
change-rules
   reset
# VESA framebuffer console @ 1024x768x256
vga = 773
image = /boot/vmlinuz
   initrd = /boot/initrd.gz
   root = /dev/sda1
   label = 2.6.33.4gensmp
   read-only
image = /boot/vmlinuz-huge-smp-2.6.33.4-smp
   root = /dev/sda1
   label = 2.6.33.4hugesmp
   read-only
--------------------------------------------------------

   Notice thee are two images at the end. The label of each is displayed on
the lilo menu and I can select either one to boot. You can have more images
there if you want them.

   Be sure to run /sbin/lilo (as root) after any changes to /etc/lilo.conf or
you'll be in deep doo-doo. Generally, typing 'lilo' (without the quotes) is
sufficient but it's such a critical step that I always supply the full path
just to be sure.

> Another question lurking is what should be considered when choosing to

   MBR. Just point lilo (via /etc/lilo.conf) to each bootable partition.

Depending on your distro, there is a lot of good information installed here:
/usr/doc/lilo-23.2
/usr/doc/Linux-FAQs
/usr/doc/Linux-HOWTOs

This last one has a good lilo how-to.  Online versions:

http://www.tldp.org/

which includes many FAQs, HOWTOs, guides...in fact pretty much
everything you ever want to know and more.

For example:

Mini HOWTO that supplements LILO docs:
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/LILO/

Subject: [PLUG] Memory configuration question
Message-ID: <20130419172729.AEA8A17F6C3@john>

I have a question for the hardware gurus out there...

I have a system I put together about 4 years ago specifically to handle 
storing/editting the HD videos I was starting to accumulate. At the time it was 
the most money I'd spent on hardware in a long time, and included an ASUS P6T 
Deluxe LGA 1366 motherboard, an Intel core-i7 920 processor, and 3 matched 
sticks of 2GB DDR3 1066 RAM, which seemed like a lot at the time.

Now that I'm (finally) starting to seriously play with ~2hrs of HD content plus 
other assorted sound/image data I'm finding myself running out of memory.

The first step is to update the 32-bit software I'm using to newer 64-bit 
versions that weren't available back then.

But since I'm already bumping up against 4GB and I've barely begun to push it, 
I figure I should throw more memory at it while I can.

The motherboard can support 24GB DDR3 1066/1333 without overclocking. Back 
then I opted for the 1066 because even that was almost $200 for 6GB. I still 
have 3 slots open, and figured I could always throw another 3 sticks in there 
if I needed it.

However, times change and prices drop.

I can't find DDR3-1066 in 6GB matched sets anymore. I can buy 3 individual 2GB 
sticks for ~$60.

Or I can get 3 matched sticks of 4GB DDR3-1333 for about 50% more (another $30 
or so).

So the question is,...
a) will I see any noticable speed boost from the faster RAM, and
b) will the RAM access be faster by having the memory spread out in all 6 slots 
(2 banks of triple-channel RAM), or will the RAM access be just as efficient 
having it all in one set of 3 slots)?

If the hardware is more efficient using all 6 slots I might be better off 
saving the money and filling it out with the cheaper/slower RAM. If not, I 
might as well upgrade to the faster RAM while I'm at it.

If I'm understanding you correctly, you're saying that you can get 3 x 2GB
sticks for $60 or 3 x 4GB sticks for $90 and the latter is faster and a
matched set of three (unlike the former which is slower and individual).
Assuming I've got all that correct...

Let me start with a disclaimer... I USED to be a "hardware guru"... but
have grown a little rusty with modern systems... I don't have the time
anymore to keep up on all the latest tips/tricks/info/specs/etc. So...
please, someone else chime in if my information seems to be out-of-date for
this modern system that John is dealing with.

That being said...

Unless the $30 is a strain for your budget - I don't see much of a point
with getting the 2GB sticks... go with the 4GB sticks.

Will you notice a difference between 1066 and 1333? Probably not, but it
shouldn't hurt anything. In order to see a difference between these, you
probably have to consider more factors... what other bus speeds are being
used in your system, for example (besides just the memory bus, you need to
look at the front-side bus/etc.)... if faster memory allows you to increase
your other bus speed(s), then you might be able to get some noticeable (?)
performance gains.

However... you seem to be considering only 2 options...
1) Replace current 3 x 2GB config with 3 x 4GB... which moves you from 6GB
to 12GB total
2) Add 3 x 2GB to current 3 x 2GB for a config of 6 x 2GB... also moving
you from a total of 6GB to 12GB

what about option 3...
3) Add 3 x 4GB to current 3 x 2GB... moving you from 6G to 18GB... and for
the same price as option 2 above (unless you have a buyer for the original
3 x 2GB - or another use for them)

Having mis-matched speeds shouldn't be a problem - AFAIK, it will just mean
that all 6 DIMMs will run at 1066. The 1333 memory should run fine at 1066
- it's just a matter of being CAPABLE of 1333 speeds.

That's my $0.025 for now (keep the extra half-cent... you never know when
another one will come along to make it whole).

And doing so will put you one step closer to 6 x 4GB dimms, or 24 GB of RAM. 

And... If you can afford $180 for RAM, there's another option.

:-/ Just because there's a greater-than-zero chance I might need more than 6GB 
doesn't mean I'm ever going to want 24GB on this system. If it was a simple 
dual-channel RAM configuration I'd be plenty happy with 8GB. If I could find a 
3x1GB package I'd probably be content to move up to 9GB total.

I guess the real question is whether there's any architectural advantage to 
spreading the RAM out through all of the slots, rather than concentrating it in 
one bank of 3. I don't grok how access interleaving happens in "modern" systems.

I agree with Rick.  Just pop in 3x4GB sticks into the empty slots.  You
won't notice the speed mismatch. BUT...

More importantly, performance will be governed by how your kernel was
compiled for memory utilization (memory paging).  If using a 32-bit
kernel compiled as a desktop, you most likely were not ever using any
memory above 4GB.  However, you may want to investigate the following
before buying RAM:

1. The bigger bang for you buck is to first convert everything to
64-bit.  That way, you will use all your available memory.

2. Consider a modern GPU, such as Nvidia, to off load video processing.
 Modern GPUs encode/decode one hell of a lot faster than any CPU.

3. If you are using UBUNTU, well...let just say pure Debian, Mint, and a
few other Debian distros are much faster.

4. Consider larger, faster Hard drives, maybe even SSD.  No matter how
much RAM you have, you will still be HD speed limited. Optimize your
HD/partition scheme: I use a second SATA drive for storing/processing.

5. Use hdparm/sdparm to optimize your hard drive.

6. File system: ext2/3/4 vs XFS vs BtrFS.  Remember, HD partitions do
not need to be all the same file system.

I am surprised by you statement the 64-bit video processing was not
available when you bought the core-i7 920.  That CPU was released end of
2008.  I was running full 64-bit before 2005 on an Athlon64 single core
- All audio and video processing was in 64bit.

Have fun,
Ed

We're getting WAY off-track now. I just need more memory. Period. I'm just 
trying to figure out the best way to do it.

You notice I never mentioned the OS. It's 64-bit Windows, not Linux. I had my 
reasons. I've been a hard-core Linux user since something like 1995 (and Unix 
before/since), but that doesn't mean I exclude other systems.

You can argue Linux/Open Source all you want, but those video tools weren't 
and still aren't mature enough. I want plug-and-play. Trust me, I spent a 
lot of time looking at all the options (Windows/Mac/Linux/Open Source/
Commercial). 

64-bit Windows applications were available then, but I also had (and still have)
a budget. Back then the 64-bit software was the pro versions that cost as much
as or more than the hardware I put together, so I had to compromise. But now 
the consumer version of the software I have is 64-bit, so I have the 
opportunity to take advantage of the extra memory.

Everything else I have is currently "fast enough". The software is 
multithreaded, and uses all 8 processor threads. And the 1366 core-i7 with the 
triple-channel memory is still a kick-ass system. If I need more, I can
upgrade the GPU since the newer software now has hooks to use the later GPUs
for mpeg encoding. But that's also a trade-off.... I have the card I use 
now specifically because it's fanless - I spent a lot of time/money trying 
to make these systems as quiet as possible since at the moment I have 5 
desktop boxes and a laptop sitting here. I don't recall seeing any current-gen 
graphics cards that use passive cooling.

I suppose it's not worth spending much more time thinking about. I have a 
coupon code for 10% off memory at NewEgg, so I guess I'll just go ahead and get 
the 3x4G of 1333 RAM, and see if I can find a home for the old 1066 sticks.

Thanks for all the feedback and comments.

Fair enough. Since you posted on PLUG I had just assumed it was Linux
related.  Extra memory never hurts, with the right OS. If you got the
cash, just go ahead and fill up all the DIMM slots.  Sell, or donate
the old sticks.  Post back if you still have memory issues due to your
fancy expensive app swapping to hard drive.

I will have to disagree on you linux video tool assessment. For example,

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alexcoxfilms/alex-cox-directs-bill-the-galactic-hero/posts/451732

Given my budget, and inclination since 1994, call me a GNU/Linux fan
boy.  I've been building and fiddling with these things for 30+ years;
Vax, Unix, CP/M, every flavor of DOS, DRDOS, FreeDOS, Win3.x, 95, 85,
ME, 2K, Xp vista, 7....   and I just don't have the energy for
Microsoft shenanigans anymore.

Have fun.

<sigh> no need to be insulted, or insulting.

I don't got the cash, or I wouldn't have been asking the questions in the first 
place. And I didn't say it was a fancy app, I said it was mature.

Yeah, and the original Babylon-5 video was produced on an Amiga. So? I notice 
the OpenShot people agree with me...

  "In 2008...I realized immediately the lack of a video editor."

I wish them all the best. We can use some successful Linux software.

There's a lot of promising Open Source software that lasts as long as the 
initial author stays interested. My drives are full of nice sounding 
abandonware that had real potential. And some really nice commercial Windows 
and Mac stuff, too, that didn't have a mature company behind it and didn't 
survive. And now I'm stuck maintaining legacy systems because I have data tied 
up in it.

And trust me, none of the Linux-based tools had decent support (if any) for 
AVCHD back when I needed it. I notice Kdenlive still isn't at version 1.0 yet. 
:-P

Cinelerra is probably the best Linux-based video editing system. I looked at 
it. It was a long time ago, I don't remember why I decided against it, but I 
had my reasons.

I know you don't believe me when I say I researched it, but I did. I just don't 
let the fact that Linux is my system of choice prevent me from using something 
else if I happen to think its the more appropriate tool.

If I was starting over today I might come to a different conclusion. But that 
was then, and now I'm vested in that software and I'm not unhappy with it.

Well, don't get too smug - I have about 10 more years and a few more systems
on you. And in my case I just don't have the energy to always fiddle anymore.

Anyway, this was intended to be an OS-agnostic question about hardware. I'm 
sorry it's degenerated into "Linux is better than Windows." I never should have 
mentioned that this particular box wasn't running Linux.

I appreciate the constructive hardware-related comments.

   I'm bringing my Dell Latitude E5410 notebook and BenQ MX520 projector (so
Keith can compare projectors), and I have three minor xfce irritations that
I would like to resolve, if possible. My posts to the xfce mail list elicit
no responses; for that matter, there's almost no traffic on it which really
surprises me.

   Irritation #1: Why the line 'xmodmap $HOME/.Xmodmap' is not read and
implemented when ~/.xinitrc is sourced. This is new with Slackware-14.0.

   Irritation #2: Why the xfce session manager does not restore the virtual
terminals when X is started. Firefox and other graphic applications (e.g.,
adobe reader) are restored to their work spaces but not the terminals. This,
too, started with the latest Slackware version.

   Irritation #3: Why the graphic desktop display is not presented when the
LCD projector is connected to the notebook. Instead, the default xfce image
(a mouse on a blue background) is used. This is a very minor irritation but
one that begs for understanding.

   While I've used xfce for a very long time I cannot find solutions to these
irritations. Perhaps I don't know just where to go look for the reasons.

Richard,

   Perhaps a good start is your asking very specific questions here. The
default lilo.conf (at least on my Slackware installations) is pretty well
self explanatory.

   What information do you seek that's not in the man page or the various
HOWTOs? It's difficult to provide directions when the destination is not
provided.

I had asked essentially the same question over on a Debian 
list. I was just pointed to 
http://users.wowway.com/~zlinuxman/lilo.htm. I don't yet 
know if it will solve all my problems but a brief browse has 
already shown some chasms in my background. I've reading to do.

However, I imagine that is going to be a bit too much info to wade through.
A good reference to keep on hand though.

I think this article covers the basics of lilo.conf pretty well.

I hope that's helpful.

I had seen both, but timing was off for them to be effective 
{N.B. I said "effective" not "useful"}.

If I had read them before first attempting to use lilo or as 
among first references after I was in trouble they would 
have been effective as well as useful.

As it was I didn't see them until after reading a lot of web 
pages and finding  a partial solution which had sent me 
following a futile rabbit trail. When I found them they were 
mis-categorized as "already have that info" ;/

As to "I imagine that is going to be a bit too much info to 
wade through", you can NEVER have too much.

I'd missed, having started with the default lilo.conf 
created by the Debian installer, the line containing 
"prompt" was still commented out.

My underlying problem with various "tutorials" is all [even 
HOWTOs] are more along line of giving out fish rather than 
teaching to fish.

Thanks for feedback received.

While complete, it dates back to sometime in the last century. I realize
that the HOWTO was updated (slightly, I think) back in 2010, but IIRC,
LILO still uses clear text passwords....

I succeeded in getting the output I want, but the font is too small. I
understand that Zenity can take html tags, but everything I have tried
has not worked. I don't know much about html formatting.

It would be awesome if I could specify a particular font that is
installed on my computer, but that may be asking too much. 

Here is the command I am using (eventually the text will have over 100
items in it - this is just a test to see if I can get it to work):

zenity --list --hide-header --column "Glyph" --column "Value" --column
"Glyph" --column "Value" --column "Glyph" --column "Value" --text= ?
283 ? 292 "Syllabic ? " 329

I just want the part after --text= to be bigger. Can this be done?

As near as I can determine, neither the --html or --font= options
are available with the --list dialog.  In fact, it looks like only
the --text-info dialog allows those two options.  Sorry 'bout
that.

Rats.

OK, Zenity is not the right tool to do what I want. If I can't read the
output it is useless.

What else can be used to make a window pop up containing six columns of
text x 35 rows and nothing else?

I'm sure you've updated your skills since that time. I think it is
reasonable to expect the same of our software.

While a good philosophy in most things, I've found that currency has
more value in software. Living in a world of TL:DR has, unfortunately,
devalued completeness.

It is difficult to remain current in today's industry without caring

Subject: [PLUG] Trying to buy a new laptop (sigh)
Message-ID: <20130422200358.17df9afb@Devil8>

So at the Clinic yesterday a fine fellow brought in a brand new
Zareason laptop. Very impressive machine. Comes with Ubuntu (among
other options) pre-installed, which it boots in 15 seconds. My appetite
whetted, I checked their website and they offer what I want, except
that I really must have a docking station, and they offer none. A phone
call today confirmed that there will never be a docking station for any
of their computers. Crossed Zareason off my list. But I'm still
shopping.

Why do I want a docking station? Because I have three USB 2.0 devices
and one USB 3.0 device that I want attached at all times when at home,
plus an ethernet cable. The USB and ethernet ports on every laptop I
have ever seen are on the sides, meaning I would have five cables strung
down the sides of the computer interfering with the papers I have on
the left side and the mouse on the right. This is not acceptable.

There exist universal docking stations, but they connect via a USB 3.0
cable, so I still have one cable down the side of the computer, plus
they do not power the computer.

I am spoiled by the mini-dock that I use with my Thinkpad T61. And if I
buy a new Thinkpad I can get a similar docking station for it. My first
question here is: Are there other laptop manufacturers out there who
offer a real docking station other than Lenovo? 

My second question is: Are there dealers in Portland who sell high end
laptops, e.g., with blue-ray burners, 512 GB SSD drives, Intel i7 CPUs,
and stuff that will probably cost me ~$2000 or more? I bought my
Thinkpad from a company downtown close to PSU, on Clay or Jefferson
west of the freeway, but they no longer sell Thinpads. Are there any
real Thinkpad dealers in town, i.e., not the big box stores?

I don't know about local stores, but our house has 3 HP elitebook 2760p
notebooks, with 8gb of ram, 160GB SSD, a dock, a slim expansion battery,
and on top of that is a convertable tablet with wacom built in, and has the
keyboard nub, keyboard light, smart card reader, Sim expansion port,
firewire, displayport, vga, 56k, gigabit ethernet, light sensor, 1080p
webcam, VGA, bluetooth 3, wirelessN, dual microphones, gyroscope.

We live by PSU, if you want to look at them.

<snicker> I'm recalling some of  my spectacular disasters 
due to ONE incorrect punctuation character in a macro.

As to TL:DR, that's a misdiagnoses the problem. The root 
would have been a poorly constructed document or a 
lazy/sloppy reader. (See _How to Read A Book_,  Mortimer 
Adler et. al. , caution ~600 pages IIRC)

A. I don't sweat "security" unless I have a system that can 
be effectively turned on.
B. Effective security is a lot more than how a password is 
stored.

USB3 is 4.8Gbps .  If the protocols and code supported it, that is
plenty fast enough to move your internet traffic and all your 
peripheral information, via a USB hub connected to your laptop
with one cable.  So that (potentially) would be two plugs, one
for power and one for USB3.   Regards "cables to the side", that
could be remediated with a "cable cover platform" - a hypothetical
something about a centimeter high, hollow/on-short-feet, flush with
the top of the keyboard, hollow (say on some short feet) underneath,
making a surface extending to the side.

But that is hypothetical, I don't know whether the code and the
peripherals exist to actually move network traffic effectively
over USB3, or whether USB3 and USB2 can be mixed through a hub
or switch at USB3 speeds.  It still does not deal with wearout
on the power connector, the main reason I use a docking station.

Does anyone know about networking over USB3 with Linux?

I don't know about networking, but there is a fancy system that I am
interested in that you can get with a SIIG "universal" dock" that
supposedly supplies power as well as networking and more USB ports. It
comes to about $2200 decked out the way I want it:

http://www.pugetsystems.com/nav/traverse/pro/customize.php?sys_id=61

Looking at the pics it appears that there is a USB 3.0 port on the
side, but at the very back, similar to the location of two of the USB
ports on my Thinkpad T61. If I connect the SIIG dock to that USB port
and the power in back as well, I would have only one cable along the
side, and not very much of that. At least it wouldn't be in the way of
my mouse. However, I said "it appears" because I can't be sure of
the location of the USB 3.0 ports from the low-res pic on their
website. Last night I sent them a message asking them to call me, but
so far they have not. 

My shopping so far has produced only the Thinkpad 530 as an
alternative. The Thinkpad has a dock similar to what I am used to with
my Thinkpad T61. That is a plus, and I am hoping the Thinkpad build
quality still holds up for the 530. But the Puget laptop can be had
with a Blu-ray burner where Lenovo offers only a reader. Yes, I can get
an external, but that is more cables. I haven't called Lenovo yet.

I'm really pissed that the Zareason laptops have the USB ports at the
front, and they offer no docks. I really like their computers (boots
in 15 seconds!) and I want one really bad, but that is a fatal flaw.
Very frustrating.

Fortunately I am not in a hurry. :)

i've used several different docking stations over the past 20 years 
(starting with the venerable PowerBook Duo, continuing with a so-so 
Toshiba, and more recently with the docks for Dell's Latitude series), 
and wasn't that impressed with any. They were all tied to a specfic 
laptop (or family thereof) and in my opinion none offered enough 
convenience to justify the cost.

For the last five years i've used an XBrand laptop stand (the fanless 
model, though my machine would benefit from the extra fan). Not only 
does it provide extra USB ports, but it has real ergonomic value, 
elevating the screen to a comfortable height. Sadly, it appears that 
they may have gone out of business - the domain is for sale, and Amazon 
has a but handful available (for very good prices).

Is this the same text each time?  Like the tables of unicode
to linguistic symbols that grace the sides of your laptop?

You can use many different tools to draw a fixed png image -
which you can make your desktop background, replicated along
the top and bottom and sides.  So rather than making something
pop up, you can temporarily shrink a foreground window and 
look at a portion of the background image.  Damned simple
compared to writing a program, and platform-independent.

A tastefully-done screen-sized background image of linguistic
symbols would be welcomed by linguists everywhere, and get
you invited to All The Best Parties.

Indeed, you guessed correctly. Those tables are exactly what I wanted
to reproduce in a pop-up window. All, of course, in anticipation of a
new computer which would probably have insufficient bezel space to hold
my paper tables to the right and left of the keyboard.

I can't stand stuff on my screen. I use a plain white background, no
wallpaper. Anything else is too distracting. Don't bring shiny objects
into my field of vision either.

I finally found a solution. I opened the tables that had been done in
OOo Writer and used Convert to Text, where OOo replaces the table
columns with tabs, then pasted into Gedit, did a bit of tweaking, and
saved as IPA.txt. Then, using Gxmessage I wrote a little bash
script to run:

	gxmessage -name IPA -font "Junicode 12" -file ~/IPA.txt

And then I added a menu item for the script to my quick launcher.
Gxmessage honors the tabs in the file, and allows me to specify a font,
so my pop-up now looks exactly the same as the paper tables alongside my
computer keyboard. I might have had the same luck with Zenity, Yad, or
Dialog, but once I discovered that it worked with Gxmessage I didn't try
further.

And it's actually better than my paper strips alongside the keyboard
because it is now trivial to change the symbols.

Subject: [PLUG] additional discovery on nanosleep() paralysis
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHeiS8=DA=NgOX8piUV-0H+xVH6gAwRLmX9x1MTyEPNo7w@mail.gmail.com>

Certain transactions during the running of the anacron job running
cron.daily on the Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS system caused the nanosleep()
function to freeze.  This suggested apt updates as the possible cause.

Today, while Ubuntu updated the software on the machine, running the
org.debian.apt.transaction commands (aptdaemon task), the timestamp
task was forced to take 5 delays around 0.719 to 0.742 secs, despite
that the timestamp task was set to SCHED_FIFO with 99 priority by the
chrt command.

Can anyone shed light onto why the apt transaction command is freezing
the nanosleep() calls for this 7/10 second delay?  Is this due to a
socket priority issue when obtaining remote packets?

Do I understand this right, that possibly automatic checks for updates 
is what is freezing your machine?

In this case, the update was done manually, after the alert, but if the 
machine was set for automatic updates, I do believe the same thing would 
occur.  I believe that the freezing is occurring sometime during the 
update process.  Of course further careful investigation is needed.

Thanks
I got the latest clear dongle and it works with Ubuntu 12.04.1.

Had some hassle getting the right unit. I asked for the one that 
works with Linux and they said they had a special. Turned out it was 
a special on the previous version. After another call, they sent the 
latest version - the one with the LEDs on it. When I asked about 
reurning the old units, they said to keep them - they were old models!

It worked on windows without the usual Clear connection manager 
popping up. It reports the login progress on its LEDs.

When I first tried it on Linux it appeared to not work. I tried it 
again tonight and it a little notification window told me it was 
connected & it just worked!

PS: At a friend's suggestion, I tried putting Linux on both 8G and 
16G thumb drives and it installed just like it was a hard drive. 
Seems to run OK too. But couldn't get it to install on a 32G

Thanks for the help
JK

I had to research nanosleep for a different reason quite a while ago.  The
nanosleep call is in the glibc library and
is done totally in user space with a spin loop.  In my case, I was getting
inconsistent results running more than
one copy of iperf at a time.  Unless nanosleep has been re-written since
Fedora 6 days, things probably have
not changed.

Hello PLUG Enthusiasts!

I just wanted to wish those of you who use Ubuntu or one of it's
community flavors a happy release day! I hear OSU OSL and PSU's Ubuntu
Mirrors are full of nice traffic as people upgrade!

The 13.04 release notes for Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Xubuntu/Lubuntu/Gnomebuntu
and shiny new Ubuntu Kylin are available here:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RaringRingtail/ReleaseNotes

I think one of the best things that landing in 13.04 is major
optimization for speed across a variety of packages and also some
power consumption improvements among all the new features.

Message-ID: <CAJeYwHdb2=At8t83ONQ2RNJ-VE_wqrAPH-9s2AKCmh-Ux8LWEQ@mail.gmail.com>

I installed the Ubuntu low-latency kernel, hoping that it would be
better than the generic kernel, but the version 3.2.0-40-lowlatency
#43-Ubuntu kernel actually was worse and froze nanosleep for up to 2.2
seconds, which is a new record delay.  The processor is a very fast
12-core I7 chip.

Has someone done a write up on system interrupt timers and how they
can be utilized for a high reliability timer?

I found out that Suse is charging about $2500/yr subscription for
their Enterprise linux with high reliability and Red Hat MRG is not
much less.  Both companies appear to be making money from the very
same need that I now face.

Randall:
For my real time stuff, I use a vanilla kernal so I can apply Ingo 
Molnar's Realtime preemption patch. You may have to switch to a 
distribution that utilizes a vanilla kernel.

I hesitate to write this as I have not applied it to a more recent 
kernel than a couple years ago, so YMMV.

Best wishes.
