That shouldn't be necessary, if ACPI is in good order.  (Caution, if you're running 2.4.20 and upgrade your BIOS, you may hit a snag with ACPI, which is why I went for 2.4.22.)  Have you considered Mr. Barry's suggestion, or are you just seeking something ready made?  I believe gkrellm has a battery monitor, if you're into that stuff.  But I should think a low battery warning would be most important, which probably requires an acpid script (an Xdialog popup would be cool).

I haven't worked this out very well on my laptop, either, so I'm just curious what you'll come up with.

It's more than package management, though that is a large part of it. Debian 
Woody, for example, is rock-solid stable and thoroughly tested. debs are not 
accepted into Woody without meeting stringent requirements. Dependencies are 
also torture-tested. 

The beauty of apt-get is it satisfies dependencies all on its own. RPM cannot 
do this. Because RPM cannot fetch packages to satisfy dependencies, apt-rpm 
and urpmi were created. And Red Carpet, and up2date, and doubtless more.

There are ways to do this. One is to use source RPMs. Another is Paul 
Heinlein's kewl fake spec file hack, which has been posted here a couple of 
times. This is the way to go for libs that are already installed. The easy 
way is to use CheckInstall. The neat thing about CheckInstall is you don't 
have to wait for someone to create a deb, rpm, apt-rpm, Red Carpet, etc. 
package. It works with any source tarball. But it's not retroactive, like 
Paul's hack.

True, but some loss is worth it, to get the antenna out from behind the
metal box.  A larger antenna will make up for the loss, and may even
increase the gain.  The internet has a lot of sites selling antennae,
some are better quality others, some a cheaper than others.

One device does not make a network.  I assume that there will be other
computers, both mobile and stationary that will need to operate in the
same subnet.  In my opinion, it will be easier to add PCI cards to the
stationary computers, and use one of these as the Access Point.

I have a similar story about 2 Siemens PCI cards, both the same model
number, bought at the same time, one had linux drivers and is still
working, the other had to go back because it had no linux drivers.  That
is why I recommended the MA311, it always (at least so far) has the same
chipset.

Used PC's are much easier to find than laptops, and they run linux

I sure do like my DSL, it has no restrictions about services.  But I
also like my bandwidth, so my linux AP is encrypted, firewalled and on a
separate subnet.

Dpkg can't do that either. I always thought apt vs. rpm was a bad
comparison. Put your SAT analogy hat on:

Redhat : rpm
Debian : _____

The answer is dpkg, not apt. Dpkg is "the package maintenance system
for Debian". Apt is a dependency resolving front-end for dpkg. Here's
a more fair analogy:

Debian : apt
Redhat : _____

Yum, apt-rpm, up2date, urpmi, etc. all fit here. Dependency resolving
front-ends for the package management tool, rpm.

  I've decided to reduce the price of the Toshiba Portege 3025CT to $375.
Here are the specs:

Toshiba Portege 3025CT Notebook Computer: small, light. reliable; weighs
only 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram).

Pentium-MMX/300MHz CPU, 96M RAM, 6.4G hard drive. External floppy, cdrom,
port strip (external monitor, printer, serial port, mouse). Two A/C power
supplies, pcmcia NIC (10/100 Mbps) and 56K modem. Manuals. Main and CMOS
batteries replaced last year.

Running Slackware-9.1 with Xfce desktop/window manager. Excellent machine.

  If you, or someone you know, wants a really solid, reliable,
easy-to-transport machine call or write me.

I've been thinking about this, and I would have to say, that in general
it will work OK.  The Debian system is designed to build your
distribution from as many sources as you want.  The majority of linux
developers create .deb's, and most can be added to your sources.list
without any problems.  The usual problem is that a package will have a
dependency that can't be filled from the sources, and the fix is to find
a source that has the dependency.

As an example, earlier this week, I did a "Sarge" install.  I did the
usual install a minimal Woody first, then change the sources.list to
point to Sarge instead of Stable, updated, then started installing
software.  Evolution wouldn't install, it had an unmet dependency.  When
I added "Stable" to the sources.list, the missing pieces were found and
Evolution was installed.

I think the problems occur when you start building software systems that
are dependent on specific versions of libraries.  As an example, the
developer will create code that has work-arounds to bugs in the library,
and when the bugs get fixed (in the next release), the work-arounds will
break.  This kind of defeats the purpose of the concept of "this package
depends on this library version foo or higher".  Most of the time,
though, new versions of libraries will not lose functions, just gain
them.

I guess what I'm saying is that the problems of running mixed sources
are more developer problems, not user problems.

HTH,

And some come with Linux from the factory.

Which reminds me of something I've been meaning to find out about.
Y'see, I'll be moving to an apartment near or on the PSU campus, and I'm
hoping I can use the on-campus WiFi for net access for my one computer.
I could just get a PCI card and an antenna, but are there WAPs that'll act
in reverse, NATing a wired LAN to a single address on a wireless untrusted
net, rather than the other way round?

Hrm, also need to figure out where all the campus WAPs are so I can choose
an apartment with good line-of-sight...

I certainly don't - such a setup would definitely be unique.  My
Wireless Bridging Router has a WAN ethernet port on the back for that.

If you go searching around PSU's online help pages, you'll find a
diagram of what areas of campus are covered by Pubnet and which aren't.

I'm going to assume you're a student.

I watched some jackass hack in to pubnet a few weeks ago, kicking an
authorized user off in the process.  That's not cool, if you ask me,
especially when you consider how much the authorized user is paying in
tuition.

I really don't think Pubnet is meant to be used as somebody's full-time
Internet connection.  Hopefully you aren't breaking the AUP in the
process.  But, considering how much tuition you are hopefully paying, I
certainly don't see a problem with it.

Here you go:

  http://www.superpass.com

Here's a strong radio:

  http://www.superpass.com/SP-AP-TE-EX1S.html

Here's a very nice omni:

  http://www.superpass.com/SPDG16OP.html

I note that I don't see the radio sold without the antenna. Ask "John"
to see if he still does that.

Short of that, the prices are reasonable and the radios themselves use
standard N connectors. One can "light up" the entire neighborhood with
these radios attached to a directional panel. 

I once performed a wireless installation that was an RF nightmare, metal
shelving with auto parts stacked on them, steel grate floor, etc. I have
to say that these components worked exceptionally a lot better than I
expected. I was able to heat up the entire office (both floors) and the
outside yard area (perhaps .5 acres) with only two radios!

I hope this helps!


Best,


Cooper

Whoops, you understood wrong.  Move on.  That's one instructor, one class
and one screwup you're talking about.  Don't worry, you'll have the
opportunity to experience many, many more of those.

Finish it at PSU, while working for the CAT.  You volunteer your time,
they teach you to be an admin and give you work experience.  Degree plus
appropriate experience equals decent job.  Degree plus nothing equals
diddly-squat.

And don't focus on Linux to the exclusion of other stuff.  Any dope can
learn to admin a homogenous, unchanging system.  Mixed environments and
integration are where the action's at.

I've had trouble more than once.  I can exclude non Unix 
systems and still have plenty to do.  It would be good 
to know multiple systems, but I see no need to even 
work with the general public in Windows as Linux and 
other alternatives are quite mature.

It's not that I'm excluding Microsoft, they can't or won't
teach Linux at PSU where I'm not gay yet that seems 
to be a requirement as far as joining Cat.

Everybody I've met associated with Linux so far there is
probably gay and didn't me around because I understandably 
attract the boyfriend.  If that's not bad enough, I tried 
to take german so I can see my sister in Stuckartt but 
ran into some very nasty gender wars and probably 
prostitutes.  The way the women dressed in that course
was just plain vulgar.  That's Neuberger for you though,
smells like something has been burned recently where the 
paintings of bloodletting among other things can make 
you think your high just walking through some of 
corridors.

I've been through Karla's 202, but I didn't pass 
the course where frankly her you can't afford help 
is very discouraging considering how highly I respect 
her.  She said I only need to do the programs and I
did well on the midterm, but what comfort is that to
me?  At least she gave me a W on finals day.  I got 
through the computer science 1, 2, and data structures 
series with her doing very well in two of them.  It's 
like I didn't even know how to study when I hit 202.  

The catalog that says I should be a computer scientist 
because I passed intro to C++, CS II, and data 
structures is not definitive nor is it helpful.  Having 
Chris Carey three inches from my face yelling at me 
during a summer course because of a controversial 
speech topic doesn't warm me up to returning to PSU 
either.  Technically I have been academically 
dismissed, why argue with that even though I have
earned a degree after the fact elsewhere?

I've also heard that Intel does not want to hire PSU 
graduates because of a political fiasco that involved 
a donation which was supposed to be used to build a 
Beowolf cluster that was instead used to provide 
individuals in the University with their own personal 
computers.  I'd say that the Katie Harman fiasco is 
just another example of how little Portland State 
cares about student institution relations, I don't 
trust the place as far as I can throw it expecially 
considering that the CS dean, Cynthia Brown, came 
out to inform the CS students that they lose a 
physics credit as part of the major.  There's
a lot of talk about going to PCC probably 
because of this for these courses.

With Portland State not having math books for three 
weeks two Winters ago and then not being able to 
return one three days after getting it when it 
finally did become available, is not acceptable.  
I'm afraid to sign up for anything there if I 
don't know what the book requirements are six 
months ahead of time to allow for shipping.
The place sickens me, I don't think I can be 
there again and expect to accomplish anything.

yeah.  I'd add, keep in mind this is all transient technology.
in five years it will be all different.  learn fundamentals and

PSU.....

To be fair, the one time I went to the help desk, there was only one guy
guy there, a chick, a guy I assumed was with the girl, and another guy I
assumed was straight.

That building just plain sucks, I agree.  I haven't taken any foreign
language courses at PSU yet, now, and don't plan to either.

I'm in one of Karla's classes right now.  I think she is perhaps a
little bit insane, but who isn't?  She was just fine with me doing all
my work at home rather than on Odin, which I thought was nice.

The first day, she told us you can walk in the day of the final and ask
to drop the course, and she'd let you.

If you *can* go elsewhere, or don't need to attend PSU, I wouldn't. 
Unfortunately, it's the only game in town for me, currently.

I haven't had the pleasure of being yelled at for anything yet, but
having my political views attacked by a Chemistry professor lecturing
infront of 200+ students was a bit much.  I didn't feel exactly welcomed
to raise my hand and argue with the dude.  The constant political
tirades one of my current professors tends to digress in to are begining
to get quite old.  At least with this one, I'm sitting next to somebody
who is as sick of the guy as I am.

That doesn't surprise me at all, yet I hadn't heard of it directly.

I originally decided to attend PSU because they saidtheir engineering
program was so well regarded.  I have thus far had *TWO* good
professors, with over 80 credits earned.  I actually had to drop two
classes because the professor's english was so rough I wasn't able to
understand enough of his lectures to get by.

I keep telling myself it's just the lower level shit that sucks to bad
at PSU... and their upper-level classes are going to be better....
hopefully I am not delusional.

Everybody I've talked to has suggested attending PCC for as many courses
as I can.

I loved that - I think I may have been hit in the same class as that, it
sounds really familiar.  It's happened to me more than once.  The PSU
Bookstore Monopoly has caused me grief way too many times.  Their prices
are high, but they can be because they're the only game in town.  I went
halfway through EAS101 before I was able to actually get the book.  One
homework assignment ended up late for it.

I'm really glad I'm not the only one that finds PSU sucks so bad.  I
just wish I had the funds to go down to OSU for school.

Hello all!

I'm a new member of this mailing list, and with luck a new member of the
group.  I have spent some time reading this thread this morning and
think I finally have something to add, so here goes.

The question of heterogeneous network integration is not a matter of OS
maturity.  It's a matter of reality.  As a system admin you are
responsible for making sure everyone that uses your network can get
there job done, and inevitably this will include someone using a
microsnot product. It's inescapable (For the most part). It might be as
simple as how to troubleshoot why Joe blow's Outlook won't get his mail,
or configuring the networking on his box so he can get out to the net.
Someone in the organization is most likely running a windoze system.  

Of course, this doesn't mean you have to know the nitty gritty of
everything about all the OS's.  I couldn't configure XP's web server if
my life depended on it right now. But I am more then capable at using
windoze as a client system, which in reality, is most of what you will
run into as a Linux admin.  

At least, this is what I have run into.  95% of the technical calls, and
troubleshooting requests I get, are in relation to someone trying to use
their windoze system, to do something on the Linux system.

Already looked.  Couldn't find it, but Google just did.

Really rude, that, and easy under the old system where you permanently
register a MAC address.  Now you auth each time you connect, which puts
the focus on cracking the password system.  That might not be an
improvement.

I can't even *find* an AUP for Pubnet.  I figure the only difference is
that I'm using a desktop, not a laptop.  But I'll likely have to host my
li'l shell/web domain elsewhere now.

I'd say evolutionary, not transient.  

And also need to disagree about things being all that different in 5
years. Looking back over the last 5, or even 10 years, things haven't
changed that much.  The quantum leaps just don't happen.  Even looking
back to the inception of windoze wasn't that shocking as point and
click, menus, and general mouse usage had been in use back in the days
of DOS.  

Linux itself has changed even less over the years.  Sure, it's more
stable, more secure, easier to use, and more efficient. Bt when you get
down to it, FTP is still FTP.  Email still works the same as it pretty
much always has (Email is how old?  30+ years?). We still use TCP/IP to
send info back and forth.  Even the web itself had predecessors, WAIS,
and Gopher.  

Only the content seems to change. I bet that won't change in the next 5
or even 20 years. 

So gain a strong footing now, hold on, and enjoy the ride.  Getting
started is the hardest. Everything else comes in little bits.  Small
improvements here and there, and subtle changes. The rest is easy.

There is a semi-middle ground, the Linksys APs. They've got a web
interface, but they're also known to use Linux as their OS. They don't
appear to be officially supporting directly talking to the OS, but it is
possible to do. TiVo-hacking anyone?

I didn't know it was on-campus - you just said near campus.  :-)

Isn't Ione Plaza open to anybody?  I don't really know, though.

I started thinking about it, and don't see any way they could secure
Pubnet from issues like this.  Maybe some of you have ideas?

The best thing I could come up with was using WEP and only letting
students know what the WEP key was - but that's so easily leaked.

You see, you can easily capture packets going through the air, with the
MAC addresses attached.  How easy is it to forge a MAC address?  Then
obtain a new DHCP lease with the forged MAC, essentially kicking the
other guy off?

Way too easy, unfortunately.

You don't need to crack the password at all.

I didn't look, but haven't been using it for anything that wouldn't fall
under a reasonably written AUP.  I think they have an AUP for all
network services, but am not really totally sure on that, as it
definitely isn't something mentioned often.

That's nice.  Your first job is almost certainly going to involve some
Windows support.  Same with the next one.  If the Fates smile upon us, you
may see a lot of work in converting systems from Windows to Linux, but
that takes a very deep understanding of how Windows systems are configured
and used.  It's inescapable, sorry.

Really?  I'll have to ask Mark Morrisey what he's teaching his grad-level
courses on instead.  Or what large portions of the EECS infrastructure,
the Beowulf cluster, robotics and rocketry projects run on.

News to me.  Intel pumps money and hardware into PSU EECS so it *can*

Par for the course with university bookstores.  With the joys of

when it comes to textbooks.

I'm sorry to hear that.  A large number of people *do* accomplish rather a

The problem with that is some professors actually make books and make
them only available at the PSU bookstore.  When I say make books, I mean
they make them out of parts of other books.

All too often they also will say you only need one or two of the three
or four books they list for the class - and only list the books for the
class at the bookstore.  Oh, and the bookstore doesn't tell you what
ISBNs go with which classes, you have to go and physically look up the
ISBNs from the books listed with each class.

For this reason, I rarely purchase my books before the class begins. 
Before the third class is usually good.

Purchasing from an online source requires you wait for shipping, and the
last time I depended upon an online bookstore to ship something within a
reasonable amount of time, I found I was up a creek without a paddle.

It would all be fine if the bookstore practiced reasonable ethics. 

If they find out the number of students in a class, they only order
80-90% of the books that would be needed if everybody bought their
books, regardless of what the professor says.  For a 101-level class,
the droppage rate isn't very high, and this makes things difficult when
the professor makes his own book.

Their prices are inflated, yet they claim they are low, because it is
run for the students, by the students, or some BS like that.  If you
don't look around, you may actually think they prices are low.  If you
look around, though, you're very dissapointed.

The PSU bookstore just plain sucks.

I second the suggestion.. the PSU bookstore doesn't have a monopoly on 
textbooks.   My brother currently buys many of his textbooks from Asia - 
  exact same contents, often less than half the cost (including 
shipping), and you don't have to deal with the PSU bookstore.

A particularly handy website for finding them is http://isbn.nu

Even when I was going to PSU and it wasn't as easy to get books from 
around the planet with just 3 clicks I think the only thing I ever 
bought at the PSU bookstore was "engineering" notepads, and that's 
because it was the only thing I couldn't find cheaper elsewhere.

Hi,

While getting a Masters degree and later teaching at PSU, I was on the
board of the bookstore.  

For a lot of complex reasons it is very hard to just break even let alone
make a profit in the retail college bookstore business.  Nobody at the PSU
bookstore is getting rich.

Also, like many college bookstores, the one at PSU is a member owned co-op.
 If they displease you, you can do something about it.

Finally, like many instructors, I advise students to checkout bookpool.com
or one of the isbn search engines before going to the bookstore.  Lately,
safari.com has also been an option.

Cheers,
Mike

P.S.  The Linux classes at PCC do focus on Linux.

you're rewriting history with hindsight.  ten years ago, the IT
landscape was still dominated by mainframes and COBOL, and
"client-server" was a new buzzword, it was going to be all sorts
of things that people do now with web browser "thin clients".

and there were lots of interesting projects that just died.
nobody knows anything about Plan 9 or the Connection Machine or
whatever any more.  token ring networks were going to be hot,
floptical discs too, etc.  and who would have thought we'd still
be using plain SMTP for email instead of X.400 or whatever?

ten years ago, you couldn't have planned for the shape of the
Internet today.  it's _hard_ to guess which technologies will
become important and which ones will disappear without a trace.

and that's true for any stage of the game we're in.  perhaps the
future ten years from now is going to be based on something
that's here today, but who has time to follow the hundreds of
things that are going to die, just so you don't miss the one
thing that doesn't?

if you want to "play it smart" and go with the clear winners, ten
years ago it was IBM, "nobody ever got fired for buying IBM".
today it's Microsoft.  Google Zeitgeist has a chart of users by
Operating System.  last year it said:
  92% Windows, 4% Mac, 1% Linux, 3% Other
today it says:
  91% Windows, 3% Mac, 1% Linux, 5% Other
the changes seem unlikely to be statistically significant, but if
you want to read the future from it, the Microsoft empire is
going to become toppled by something in "Other".  what's it going
to be?  how are you going to find it?

it's all a crapshoot.  just pick a few things that are fun and
useful enough for now, and stay flexible.

It's true, everyone at PSU involved with both the CAT and Linux are
completely flaming gay. Better stay away from them, laddy, or they'll
convert you, too!

The prostitutes are what make Neuberger so wonderful. Just be thankful
they aren't allowed in any of the other buildings. No blood-letting in
Neuberger, though. Medieval medical practices are confined to the
sub-basement of Smith Memorial, which is incidentally where the eugenics
lab is located. Stop by some day. They're making great progress!

I guess I should mention, I'm probably gay, and my boyfriend is
probably not interested in you.

have you considered the possibility that people don't want you
around because you're annoying?  you're mildly annoying in email.
I don't have any idea if you're as annoying in person.  if you
are, you might want to do something about that.

Ah, but I'm an undergraduate so that doesn't 
mean anything to me yet.  As far as the gay 
comments, Portland State is the only place 
where I've ever had a problem and I'd been 
around homosexuals prior to going there.
  
The one thing I didn't like is the pressure 
towards special treatment from the slanted 
Viking newspaper on this and other issues.
Maybe the problem is that there aren't 
enough other minded outspoken people 
at PSU to bring balance to the culture.  
I'd like to bring some balance, but I 
have a responsibility to my own 
education which has suffered 
unfortunately.  Especially with the likely
chance that Alcaida, perhaps even Saddham
himself, are hiding at PSU makes it not
the wisest choice for a political venue.

The level of anger I ran into in Jonathan 
Nix's course was unmistakeable also.  I'm 
not at a point in my life where I want to 
be around predominantly loud and obnoxious 
people regardless whether they be students 
or faculty.  Certainly many in the classes 
I took were adults, though enough weren't 
to merit complaint.

And another thing, electrical engineering 
or frankly any engineering comments to me 
are not very helpful because computer 
scientists at PSU aren't in the 
engineering program and in my experience
the individual departments are very 
selfish and don't welcome outsiders.

The you'll have to support Windows comments are 
disingenuous and false.  I don't have to do 
anything with computers, perhaps beyond what 
I've done already I shouldn't do more.  Perhaps 
grant writing or law enforcement offer more 
satisfying career path alternatives.  Someone
ought to get state funds pulled from PSU until 
it cleans up the wall in Neuberger where
a woman purposely cutting her finger complete
with blood is painted among other hideous 
so called art displays.  That fetid smell in
the stair wells needs to go to.  PSU needs 
to start screening instructors, Chris 
Cary had no right to physically threaten 
me.

One thing I won't miss is being free of 
abortifacients 'R us with nurses in the
health center along with women coming
in totally disregarding the value of
human life in their comments and with
their attitudes.  I tried to protest 
once by saying have the child to one
gal, but all it did was paint a target 
on me.  It's Clinton's school, right 
down to Clinton's poor morals.

And another thing about Windows, you 
practically have to study every year to 
stay current in it because it changes 
completely frequently, one of the 
reasons it's such a heavy and bug ridden 
system.  If I ever do formally study it 
it's the  last thing I want to cover, not 
the first.  Why would I want to encourage 
people to use such a non user friendly 
environment anyways ;-)

How about keeping that intentional slam to yourself 
like an adult would.  Maybe I need to be more annoying,
though it's more affective to catch bees with honey
than it to use vinegar even though the diplomatic 
approach is a lot less fun.
  
If gay power people make enough noise they're asking 
to be reminded they're a minority even within the gay 
community.  At least I hope they get reminded, or
this isn't going to be a good place for any straight
person to live for very long.  

The Sunni at 20% of Iraq's population maintained a 
brutal dictatorship.  There isn't a 20% hell bent gay 
minority or any other similarly hell bent 20% minority
in Portland, but with so few people involved in the 
political process framing the issues and even fewer 
people voting... the tyrany of a minority is a real 
danger in this state.  Oregon is not revolutionary, 
we are out of step with the rest of the nation 
legalizing assisted suicide and supporting rabid 
gay power advocates that threaten even other gays
who don't agree with them.
  
The culture at Portland State is out of control to 
the detriment of all, to the detriment of those who 
want to reduce hatred and intolerance, to the 
detriment of many who live here and want to 
stay.

Stopping hate goes all ways, it is as wrong for 
gays to attack "straights" as it is for "straights" 
to attack gays.  The lifestyle is another matter
though.  I oppose gay marriage, openly gay dating,
and hostility against "straight" people 
because they aren't gay.  I also oppose "straight" 
people committing crimes of rape, artificial birth 
contol use to prevent pregnancy, and abortion.

If I was annoying where I didn't talk much at PSU, 
I must have been incredibly talented.  I had 
friends there which shows I didn't annoy everyone.  
Seriously though, prostitution for example hurts 
real people where I had a favorite dancing partner 
break down in tears because of it shortly 
thereafter telling me to look elsewhere for a 
girlfriend. She claimed she doesn't deserve me. 
My attempts to encourage her did not withstand 
her despair.  She's a good person with a good 
heart who doesn't deserve to be enslaved as a 
prostitute, no person deserves this.  She 
deserves better nutrition and a free ticket 
home to Ireland to rejoin her family, nothing 
less.
  
How many more negatively impacted women are out 
there?  How many more have to cry for someone 
to help them?  Why won't PSU even make a start 
by cleaning up Neuberger Hall's art?  What
about every woman's birthright where the clinic
pushes the use of birth control and the
morning after pill?  As Oregonians we could 
bring about change by replacing the governor 
with a person who has the moral courage to 
undo the bad legislation mandating that doctors 
push artificial birth control, sterilizations, 
and abortions.  These things are feeding the 
prostitution epidemic.

The Native American paintings are really 
nice, maybe some progress towards a 
cleanup of Neuberger is evident.  I 
hope the cleanup work continues until
the building is completely purged.

I've been using it for a year or two, and it seemed like it was ready

Or do you mean spokesmodel?
I asked my eleventeen closest geek friends. One said "Amiga is the one true 
OS!" Two would not look up from adjusting the precise tangerine/mauve hues on 
their OS X boxes. A couple others were crabbing about the Fedora project. A 
good half-dozen were chanting GENTOO GENTOO and would not stop. 

So I says to myself, I'll ask PLUG. Even if I don't get a useful answer, I'll 
get some entertainment.

Obviously no!  Actually I have, but it doesn't matter if I 
don't know what I'm after early enough to get it shipped.  I
did in fact order the book for Maria Balogh's computer logic
class but it didn't arrive until three weeks had passed 
leaving me facing a test before getting the book.  The book
store finally got some in just a hair sooner so I have two
copies now.  The bookstore one was picked up right at the
cutoff date.  For a student coop the bookstore people were
awfully rude.  Considering I was told I could bring the 
book back verbally after the cutoff for a refund because 
of the situation, I wasn't happy when told that wouldn't
be honored and that at most I could fill out a protest 
form but likely wouldn't get a refund.

I SAID THE PEOPLE I HAVE MET SO FAR THAT I KNOW TO BE ASSOCIATED
WITH LINUX AT PSU, CLEARLY NOT EVERYONE IN CAT NOR EVERYONE I'VE 
MET THERE.  Some Linux folks at PSU may want to find the straight 
guys because it is less stressfull when the am I viewed as a 
boyfriend or competition to a boyfriend issue isn't a concern.
It may come as a surprise but I didn't meet a lot of the people
at PSU at the time I was there or maybe I don't realize how many
people I've come across.

It's not much fun when you get someone's phone number hoping you
can work with them in a course only to find out they can't be 
reached because they're out on a fling or at a minimum flaking 
out just before dropping.  

Try understanding being blocked by someone after complimenting 
her.  Tried to be a gentleman with this one gal in a class I 
was taking only to find that before long her email address 
didn't work anymore.  I don't have time for that.  I've had 
much better luck outside of PSU.  At least one guy picked 
up on what was up when I was ditched trying to sell a book 
to one of these two gals in my classes, and felt sorry for 
me.  The sad part is that this one gal could handle the 
material without the book where being able to get with 
her to study could have been helpful, if only she'd a been 
of a higher caliber.
 
The fighting in the German class I tried to take 
between Judy Laing and the major prof was ridiculous.  
I didn't pay to watch a gender conflict complete with 
shouting at each other unfold in front of me.  I was 
very disappointed.  I didn't stay in part because
this instructor fighting the other prof seemed to be 
coming onto me too which decidedly wasn't the thing to 
stick around for.  It wouldn't have looked good to get 
a grade from her.  The environment wasn't safe 
where I had no interest in even the possibility 
of somehow ending up between these two.

So no, the prostitutes comment is not an accurate
one as far as what's "fun."

As far as mixed debian which is what this thread is about...
I'm wondering why mix stable and unstable source code?
Is the idea here to have a stable and unstable system
installed on the same partitions functioning as any
normal stable or unstable system would?  This I would
think ought to translate to multiple root paths and
library paths.  How about user mode linux here, maybe 
that is what's needed.

I recall an article years ago where someone at Amazon.com said they
outsource to Powell's City of Books for most of their orders.  So why
not cut out the middle man and get on the Portland Screechcar
somewhere at PSU and get off at 10th and Couch?  It's right there, you
don't even leave fareless square, and you can catch a return
screechcar at 11th and Couch.

You might try going to telnet://dyna.multcolib.org/ and searching for
each title.  Multnomah County Library's system will tell you the ISBN
for each book it has.  Very handy.

I'm not sure a college bookstore should be a for-profit venture.
Tuition is already astronomically inflated to begin with, stop
price-gouging the future.

Actually, knowing Felix personally, I would take that as constructive
criticism and not a slam.  Felix can seem a little blunt without being
able to hear his intonation.

No, that's quite alright.  You're coming off as downright homophobic
and offensive to straight people like myself.  Relax, sip your coffee,
live and let live.  Not everybody wants in your pants for a variety of
reasons, and people are generally responsive if you tell them you're
not interested.

Actually, the web came before gopher.  I can't remember the exact
dates, but 1988 comes to mind for the web, and 1993 for Gopher for
some reason.

s/Woody/stable.  Woody will eventually join it's cousins in the
obsolete archive and not receive any updates, whereas stable will
still get the rock solid stuff.

That is the nature of testing, though I would strongly recommend
pinning to testing and using unstable instead of stable for a source.
Less likely to run into twisted breakages that have been known to
result from mixing stable with anything newer.

Yes they do and I can't wait until I'm done with the last of my

When talking about aggressive homosoexuals, I think it's 
allowable to be homophobic.  I'm not talking about friendly
gays who really are gay trying to live respectable lives.

Saying anything negative about homosexuality earns a person 
the homophobic label in this city, it's one of the major 
problems here.  Look what happened to Kroeker who debatedly 
wasn't after gays as so many claim, and I'm sure
there is or will be an even less controversial example.  
I've heard that Katz micromanages and that this is what 
lead to his resignation.  

It's a tragedy that Kendra got shot, but why is the officer 
involved taking the heat if he was following proper police 
policy?  Some have said that Katz created a situation to get
Kroeker to resign.  Maybe Kroeker had problems, though 
looking at this and other situations one can conclude that 
the politics in Portland stink.  Is the wrong person taking
the media heat?  A good leader should eat crow instead of 
sacrificing the underlings for political gain.

A certain segment of the gay community is very outspoken 
in Portland which the Kroeker controversy proved.  Further 
proof is the litmus test many have tried to throw against 
Smith.  Do you have to be pro gay in this state to get 
elected?  What exactly does that mean?  It's interesting 
that the opinions flip, perhaps too far, on many issues 
when you get a few miles out from Portland.  I don't 
want to see people hung because they are thought to be 
gay, but I don't approve of this are you pro gay litmus 
test that is getting to be well known around Portland
either.  

I don't care for the filibusters that are preventing Bush 
from exercising his authority to fill vacancies in the 
supreme court either.  Does our president have this 
authority?  What are the implications of him losing it?

Because of the politically hostile nature of Portland even
for a quiet person, it's just not a place I want to be.  
To some degree I could tell certain people to leave me 
alone, but why should I live where I'd have to do that? 
Why do I have to conform to Portland when it ought to 
conform to me?  I'm not inflexible, but there's a limit.

Just for reference, as far as I can tell the general PLUG list is not
intended as "technical only".  According to the website, it is for:
"General Linux discussion and assistance", where I read "Linux"
broadly to mean Free/Open-Source Software as well as other Unix-like
operating systems.

I don't see where pea-brained drivel fits neatly into any of the
mailing lists though.

Well Russell, you could stop posting.  A mailing list isn't enough
to solve a number of problems where the difficulty many have in using
say Portland State to compensate is a very relevant topic of discussion
in and of itself.  And as far as plug-talk, who ever posts on it
anyways.  About the choice language, it hope it's not a reflection 
of your intelligence.  It certainly doesn't reflect decency to be 
putting God's name in every demeaning statement that comes out of 
you.

I don't know what's up with you Carla, your statements are no better.

I hope everyone is enjoying the snow.

Consider a list of information in a text file, with columns

Within "id", I want to match all possible pairs of meas:

  id  meas_a val1_a val2_a ... valn_a meas_b val1_b val2_b ... val2_n

   3      3  ...                          4  ...

I am doing something like:

awk '$1 != last { n = 1 ; a[n++] = $0 }
     $1 == last { a[n++] = $0 ; for (i=1 ; i<n-1 ; i++) { print a[i],$0 } }
     { last = $1 }' input-file

Can anyone thing of any thing more clever or clean?

Gopher was released in 1991.  The WWW project started at CERN in 1989 
but wasn't released to the world until 1991.  The Web didn't take off 
until Mosaic in 1993.

  I solved the problem of determining the remaining battery life on the new

does work quite nicely. The tarball is all of 80k if anyone wants a copy.
Stuff like this would do well on the PLUG Web site, no?

Dear All:

I am curious to see if anyone has used the Linux-NTFS driver?
(http://linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net/)

In particular, I am interested to see if anyone has ever tried using that 
driver
to mount remote NTFS partition?  All the instructions that come
with the driver only deals with local drives.

I've used the Linux-NTFS driver... in fact, I have an NTFS partition on
this system mounted at the moment.

What do you mean by mount remote NTFS partitions, though?  You don't
mount remote partitions at all... it just doesn't quite jive.

Do you mean mount a Windows share?  If so, you just use smbfs for that,
you don't care what filesystem the fileserver is using for its files.

Thanks for adding to the list.  Other good bookstore links:

www.addall.com   (searches other lists)
www.amazon.com   (reviews, ISBN, sometimes even worth buying from)
www.powells.com  (it's local, sometimes it's on the shelf)

The faster you want a book, the more expensive it will be.  The earlier you
start looking, the cheaper you can find a book in time to start classes.
Perhaps things are different now, but when I was in college, I could
usually find out from an instructor weeks in advance of posted schedules
what the text would be.  That meant I could find the cheapest copies
available (I usually had my pick of the used copies) and it also meant
I could skim the book and read a few chapters before class started. 
And that meant that I could stay ahead of the curve rather than grimly
race to catch up.

Yeah, that is exactly what I would like to do.  Mount another Window box 
NTFS partition
and read it from my Linux box.

So you don't recommend it?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.31.0311021720570.15357-100000@lorien.wv.mentorg.com>

I've got a new DVD drive (Pioneer 106 recorder), and it has a 4-pin
digital audio connector. Until now I've only seen 2-pin digital audio
(spdif), that's what my previous drive had, and that's what my sound card
has (one might guess by now that the cable also has two wires). Now this
device has four. Anyone knows the pinout for such connection? I suspect
there is still only one digital out pin (and ground), and the rest is not
used (or may be it has digital input too?), but which one?
And yes, I read the slip of paper which comes with it, it only mentions
analog audio (which is always 4-pin but different connector).

Thanks,
Fedor

You misunderstand... as long as the Windows box has it shared out, it
doesn't matter if it's NTFS, FAT, or whatever else (as long as Windows
can read it without any problems).

Just set up sharing on the Windows Box and set up Samba on the linux box
to mount it.  If the Windows box is shared without any passwords or
anything, you can probably just do a:

mount -t smbfs //windowscomputername/sharename /where/you/want/it/mounted

And have it there.

If it's NTFS partition on the same PC which runs Linux (i.e. you
dual-boot) you can read it, you may need to compile the ntfs.o module in
the kernel (in some versions of RH this module is available, in others
they compiled the kernel with NTFS option disabled in config).

If the partition is on another machine, you don't even care that it's
NTFS, enable sharing on that Windows machine and use samba to access the
shared partitions.

NTFS isn't a networking file system. 

NT/XP/W2K/W2K3 share these file systems via the SMB protocol. If you are 
wanting to mount any partition that exists on a windows based machine, you 
look into installing samba on your *nix box. Alternatively, you install an 
NFSd driver on the Windows system to share the drives out via NFS.

The NTFS driver project is so that you can mount a drive locally. I.e. You 
physically move the hard drive from the Windows machine to your linux box, 
and then mount it there.

If you don't have an oscilloscope, a DC volt meter should indicate the 
presence of signal (assuming an audio disc is playing).  To find ground, 
look for continuity between the chassis and one of the pins.

If you don't have a DMM, use trial-and-error until tomorrow when you go buy one.

'man gpg'

gpg --keyserver keyserver.net --send-key <key_id>

iirc...

if all else fails, manpage.

Yeah, and I have your's too. Now when are we having a key signing party? 

Or does that only happen at Plug meetings?

Assuming this happens. :)

What would be the way to do this? Do I simply print out my checksum and hand 
it out? Bring my laptop with the public keys on it?

I'll have my laptop.

I haven't ever been to a key-signing party, and haven't signed very many
keys...

To sign a key, we just need to know that you're the owner of the key in
question and that you are who you say you are.  I don't know what folks
constitute showing proof of identity these days - the DMV needs what, a
piece of picture ID and two pieces of non-picture ID?  Is that
overkill?  Suppose we could google to see what's standard.

After we've decided it's definitely you, we can all just individually
sign the key you tell us is your own.  I'll be able to do it right there
on the spot and upload the signature then, too.  A printed-out key
fingerprint should be good, I think.

Anybody out there ever signed a bunch of keys?

Rob

Well, now that I'm working first watch, weekdays only (first time in
two years that I've had a *real* schedule), I'd be happy to.  I only
have one piece of photo ID, though...

Well, no.  I signed a couple of keys at Conifur Northwest
(http://www.conifur.org/) when I was there a while back, and there was
a debian-user keysigning that I organized but subsequently overslept
through before that...

Google for the keysigning party HOWTO, I believe it's hosted over at

A photo-ID (most commonly a license you're surrendering within 30 days
of moving into the sate (since you're only allowed to have one, and
they're automatically invalid after 30 days of moving into a new
state, no matter what the expiration date is, just like license
plates) or a student ID), and a birth certificate.

The Keysigning Party HOWTO recommends two pieces of official photo
IDs, like a passport and a driver's license, but I generally have
skimped with just a driver's license since I haven't known the
location of my passport for years now...

With an organization like PLUG, it's best to take a "trusted
identification" kind of approach.

I know Galen is Galen and Russell is Russell and Zot is Zot.  There is a
circle of trust among nearly all of us.

All I REALLY need is to know that Russell's key is Russell's key and there
was no man-in-the-middle to intercept and substitute the data.  Hence,
Russell should hand me his key in person.  And if he says, "Oh, and this
is Rob and here is his key", I'll sign that, too.

> Anybody out there ever signed a bunch of keys?

Alan organized the last mass keysigning we did here.  It was very quick
and dirty.  Ask him.

That's also the difference between formally identifying and casually
identifying for "trust" reasons.

I don't understand why trust is in quotes here.  I certainly trust Russell

You can forge a license... you can even forge a passport... but you can't
forge a Russell Senior.  Not yet, anyway.

Hash: SHA1

The few keysignings I've had (one Intel, one Debian) basically went like
this: I see your driver's license and you give me a printout of your
thumbprint (including hashid and email id). And vice versa. Then
afterwards, I download your key based on the hashid and compare it to your
email id and thumbprint (gpg --fingerprint [hashid]). If it checks out,
I sign it authoritatively and upload it to the key server.

If one had a laptop, was a student, and had access to pubnet, one could
do this interactively, I suppose, but it would be rather time consuming
past a few signatures.

Russ Johnson admonishes us:
> Top post? http://www.caliburn.nl/topposting.html

... which makes an unproven and irrelevant statement:
  "Smit/DeHan: The majority of Usenet-users prefer bottom-posting."

... and quotes RFC1855, which is about a different subject:
 "If you are sending a reply to a message or a posting be sure you
  summarize the original at the top of the message, or include
  just enough text of the original to give a context."

On the other hand, Emerson reminds us:
  "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds"

Notice the word "or" in the above RFC sentence.  The first phrase
says "summarize" about the top;  the second phrase after the "or"
makes no recommendations about placement.  Apparently Smit and
DeHan are unable to follow the plain meaning of English, and are
thinking in Dutch (where that word order might convey a different
imperative).

The point of any posting is to convey meaning, not to follow some
machinelike format.  We are not compilers.  Sometimes top-posting
is appropriate;  this is the way all printed literature with
footnotes work.  For those of us who do publish in print, the
habits and preferences of the "anti-top-posting" portion of the
email community (a small subset of a small subset) are not holy
writ, much as some would have it so.

There are many useful points in RFC1855 (Category: Informational)
that are well worth considering.  There are statements about line
length, when to post, how to post, etc. that are worth reading by
many people here.  But RFC1855 puts its references at the bottom,
and many writers and readers have come to expect the same.  

Probably the main focus of RFC1855 is "write for your audience"
which is the main focus of any good writing.  I have top posted
here, because the statement Russ made was concise and to the 
point, albeit wrong.  In other cases, where I feel the quoted
material is excessively verbose, I will summarize and top post.
Anything else is a waste of reader's time.

Keith

P.S.:  And please, when replying to this, configure your mail

is emails that are laden with MicroCruft like "=2D --=20" .

Beware that Powell's keeps a lot of its textbooks in a warehouse in the
Midwest.  I don't know if they'll transfer it to a store for free, like
with the local warehouses.

I use www.campusi.com, but addall.com looks a bit nicer.

That's what I did.  They'll often point you to their online syllabus;

Erm? http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9dist/

One of the biggest stumbling blocks to plan 9 adoption was getting Lucent
to release it under an acceptable open source license. However, it appears
they changed their license this summer, in such a way that it meets OSI
approval -- I don't know the FSF thinks of the new license, since the
only webpage I can find <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/plan-nine.html>
refers to an older (and truly problematic) version of the license.

Sadly, I just haven't had time to play with it....

Oh yeah?  Well, "Little hobgoblins is the consistency of foolish minds."

I've been thinking for a while on how to implement a universal quoting
format, such that the MUA can intelligently handle quoting and attribution
per the user's needs.  Wouldn't it be great if your MUA could follow the
discussion and do the dirty work of formatting it so it's easy for
everyone to follow, however they like to read?

> Probably the main focus of RFC1855 is "write for your audience"

Indeed.  F'r instance, if you're writing for Outlook users, they often
want you to top-post because they use the "message preview" feature, which
shows the first few lines in the message list.  Unfortunately, Outlook
isn't smart enough to realize that the reply is often the stuff without
'> ' in front of it, at the bottom.  (And no, I don't get the point of
Message Preview.)

For another instance, bottom-posting is common with Usenet, mailing lists,
Internet old-timers and *nix users.  There are aesthetic and structural
reasons for this, but IMO the most useful reason is simply that, like
choosing to drive on the right side of the road, any consensus is better
than none.  MUAs are adapted to it, discussions all flow the same
direction, things like that.


This is way more fun than that *other* flamewar,
  Aaron

Yes.

It's worth mentioning, I think, that the two emails were signed very
differently.  The one you quote was signed plainly.  The signature
itself was part of the text of the message.  The one I quote was signed
using PGP/MIME, so the signature is a separate MIME part.

There are, unfortunately, many broken MIME-capable mail clients that
simply are unable to decipher PGP/MIME.  When a PGP/MIME message comes
through, they see a blank message with two attachments; one the body of
the message itself, and the other the PGP signature of the message.

OE is likely the most popular of those broken mail clients.

However, Evolution takes a different stance, quite opposite from
Microsoft's OE in this respect.  PGP/MIME messages are *very* easily
verifiable.  I only have to click on a lock at the bottom of the message
to receive the signature information.  If the message is signed
plaintext, however, I have to save the message and verify the saved
message.  Copying and pasting seems to take out the linebreaks.

IIRC, KMail is smarter than Evolution here.  KMail, I believe, is able
to easily (and automagically) verify the integrity of an email no matter
how it is signed.  I guess KMail signs in plaintext, too, as I know mutt
signs using PGP/MIME because some folks who use mutt as a news client
tried to sign their usenet posts but were unable to get it to work
plaintext without just using a pipe to gpg.

I stopped signing messages to PLUG several months ago simply because the
only way Evolution (my favorite mail client currently) is able to sign
posts automatically is using PGP/MIME, and there *are* folks on this
list who use OE and the like who can't easily read PGP/MIME signed
messages.

I see in the last few months, though, that PGP/MIME on the list seems to
be more popular than it was a year ago, so I may just end up signing
posts again...

I just got an email from Red Hat, stating the "end of life" of Red Hat
9 will be April 2004. After that, there will be no more "Red Hat Linux"
distributions.

There will be a "workstation" version, called Red Hat Enterprise Linux
WS, for $179, and s "server" version called Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES
for $349. This price is per server, per year subscription free, and
includes no support. The support versions are significantly more
expensive. Here's the URL of their pricing structure:
http://www.redhat.com/software/rhel/purchase/index.html

Maybe it's time I research some other distributions.

Below is the email Red Hat sent me, if you're interested.

-Scott

Thank you for being a Red Hat Network customer.

This e-mail provides you with important information about the upcoming
discontinuation of Red Hat Linux, and resources to assist you with your
migration to another Red Hat solution.

As previously communicated, Red Hat will discontinue maintenance and
errata support for Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 8.0 as of December 
31, 2003. Red Hat will discontinue maintenance and errata support for 
Red Hat Linux 9 as of April 30, 2004. Red Hat does not plan to release 
another product in the Red Hat Linux line.

With the recent announcement of Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.3, you'll
find migrating to Enterprise Linux appealing.  We understand 
that transitioning to another Red Hat solution requires careful 
planning 
and implementation.  We have created a migration plan for Red Hat 
Network 
customers to help make the transition as simple and seamless as 
possible. Details:

****************
If you purchase Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS or ES Basic before February
28, 2004, you will receive 50% off the price for two years.[*] (That's 
two
years for the price of one.)

****************
In addition, we have created a Red Hat Linux Migration Resource Center
to address your migration planning and other questions, such as:

* What are best practices for implementing the migration to Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux?

* Are there other migration alternatives?

* How do I purchase Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS or ES Basic at the 
price
  above?

* What if my paid subscription to RHN extends past April 30, 2004?

****************

Find out more about your migration options with product comparisons,
whitepapers and documentation at the Red Hat Linux Migration Resource 
Center:

To modify your example a bit:

 A: Top posting is an easier read through when the answer is complete
    and doens't depend on the question for context.  It leaves the 
    previous information in place for further reference but the
    reader doesn't have to wade through it to get to the new information.

 Q: Can you point to an example where top-posting on a discussion list conveys
    more meaning more readily than bottom-posting?

Bottom posting really gets to be a drag when the quoted context is greater than
a screen or two.  But that's mostly because such extended quoting is a drag.

The memo didn't say anything about the Fedora distribution.  That would
seem to be the direction for those who like RedHat and want  or need a
free version.  

Not that you don't have an overwhelming amount of choice in case you do

If ease of installation is a criteria the recent porting of RedHat's 
Anaconda installer to Debian might make Debian more interesting.

Well, you can still copy the software as much as you like, and install it
on any number of machines. You don't get subscription, and you get no
support, which is different from what you get when you buy retail RH now
in ... no way at all (the "support" you get with the purchase is
worthless).

But this move will inconvenience many Linux users. I am surprised that no
distribution stepped up with a "migration installer" similar to the
upgrade installer which installs newer RedHat over the older one. If a
distribution which is reasonably good by itself released a product like
that they could sweep 90% of (would be ex-)Redhat install base overnight.

RedHat the company seems to be completely sure that they don't need the
support of Linux enthusiasts anymore, that they can get into businesses
through the front door instead o being "smuggled in" by programmers and
engineers as used to be the case. Time will tell if this confidence is
justified or they are committing suicide.

I don't see a problem here. Fedora for free-beer free, Red Hat Enterprise for 
paid, and Free. Here is what Red Hat told me when I asked for clarification 
of license terms:

"With Red Hat Linux 9 and Fedora, you may install from single disk set on 
as many systems as you like.

"With Red Hat Enterprise Linux, you must purchase the technology as part 
of a yearly subscription that includes maintenance and support. ?At the 
end of the subscription, if you choose not to renew youor subscription, 
you are free to use Red Hat Enterprise Linux on your own (unsupported). 
Binaries and source code are freely available for Red Hat Enteprise 
Linux, but users who roll their own versions are not able to be 
supported by Red Hat.

"More info on our licensing can be found at http://www.redhat.com if yuo 
search under 'GPL'.

If you want to get torqued about commercial Linuxes, take a look at Lycoris 
and Lindows. Their licenses are quite restrictive, and they provide no 
obvious method of obtaining sources, as they are supposed to. SuSE charges 
per-seat licenses on some of their servers.

I don't know of any Linux distribution that supports their entire line 
indefinitely, all the them cut off the old stuff eventually.

IMO, Debian is unnecessarily difficult to install. Both Libranet and Knoppix's 
hardware detection are phenomenal. The Knoppix installer is Kudzu-based, with 
tweaks by Klaus Knopper. I believe Anaconda uses Kudzu. Which I don't know if 
I actually have a point to make here, except a better installer for Debian 
would be loverly. :)

The Business Journal is reporting that Waggener Edstrom, Microsoft's PR
mouth piece, is moving headquarters to Seattle.
http://portland.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2003/11/03/story3.html

>From the story:
"Waggener Edstrom functions as lead agency for Microsoft and doesn't
disclose publicly what proportion of its revenues are derived from the
software giant. Many industry observers suggest a significant portion of
Waggener Edstrom's revenue is from Microsoft. Many of Waggener Edstrom's
nearly 100 employees stationed near the high-tech leader at an office in
Bellevue, Wash., work on the account.  ... French denied that the client
has pressured the firm to label Seattle its home."

Who knows, maybe having their lead PR agency HQ located in such a
Linux-active area like Portland is just to much for Microsoft.

It will be interesting to see how the Fedora project evolves. The general
idea is to turn it in to a community-driven project like Debian. If that 
happens then support (of the OSS unofficial variety) could be better 
compared to the soon-defunct plain Red Hat Linux. For example what's to 
keep the Fedora community from releasing security patches for Fedora Core 
releases beyond the one-year cycle envisioned by Red Hat? It all depends 
on how much of a real community develops, who's in it, and what their 
priorities are.

The problem I have here is that you have to go back and re-read the answer
a second time in order to ensure that the actual question asked was being
addressed rather than some evasive double-talk.

Yeah, I don't really see where any of the context you quoted was

They must be serious about it.  They didn't even say they'd consider
staying if we built 'em a new stadium and gave 'em tax breaks.

I feel sorry for the staff of any company that bets the farm on serving a
megacorp.  The company stops foraging, and then starves when it inevitibly
gets dumped.

More likely, the size of the MS account shifted the center-of-gravity of
WE's upper management up north.  The office (and its staff) always moves
to accomodate the brass, not the other way around.

But it's fun to think so.

That's only a problem when lusers can't be bothered to trim the

I use my Microsoft IntelliMouse Wireless Optical Explorer (or whatever
it is - all those words, maybe a different order?) with my laptop.

It works just like any other USB mouse,  IMPS/2 protocol, needing to do
the zAxisMapping stuff for the scroll wheel.

I've created a web-based front-end to a database.  Whenever there is a
Javascript onchange event in a text field, I call a Perl script that saves
the new field data in the database.  Currently I have a small window that
pops up for a brief second and then closes after the Perl script has
finished.
Is there any way to avoid the little popup window and just have the Perl
DBI script do its thing in the background without constantly interrupting
the user?
Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix ESMTP authentication
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.52.0311031439260.9995@shaft.bitmine.net>

So, I set up a mail server for a fellow I know and I'm trying to make the
authentication work.

I'm not a postfix person, but it seemed the right thing for this job.
Many virtual domains.  I ended up using a mysql database for the
authentication and domain information.

I can't seem to make authentication work from outside the local net... and
I can't seem to figure out how to make it work with telnet, either (can't
figure out which commands to issue... this should be a no-brainer, but web
searches reveal ESMTP keywords that don't seem to be supported).

So... can someone point me in a direction that'll help me troubleshoot?

Also, I was having a problem early on where mail was getting rejected
without any notification... not even in the debug level mail logs.  Is
there a good reason for that?  (I think they were being hit by the now
removed RBL reject lines.)

yeah, text formatting is a sucky issue that's never going to get
better until anti-html bigots (like me) finish dying off.  I bet
in the future, program source code will be written in xml too.
that's going to suck.

Message-ID: <20031103225051.GA4886@gate.kl-ic.com>

Yes, Redhat is changing how they do business.  As I mentioned here
a couple months ago, I am concerned that with this step they are
losing the newbies, who are a PITA in the short term, but are where
Redhat's growth comes from in the long term.  OTOH, there is plenty
of opportunity to convert more corporate customers, and if Redhat
achieves their corporate goal (reducing a 5 billion per year
operating system market to a 500 million per year market - RH CEO
Robert Young) they will indirectly serve all of us.

That said, Redhat is handling this decision in a reasonable way, with
the Fedora project.  I am running Fedora Test 3 on one machine, and
though there are issues they are not showstoppers.  Fedora bugs posted
to bugzilla.redhat.com get prompt and intelligent responses from Redhat
employees and others.   By being a downloadable but tested release,
Fedora is reducing the lead time between application appearance and
general availability, and getting people up to date with tested versions
of applications is the fastest way to get open source out there.

The way this may work out is that we do the newbie support ourselves.
There may be some money in it, so maybe it isn't bad that Redhat has
left this to us.

The general release version of Fedora was originally due today (Nov 3),
but their website mentions a delay for a respin.  I hope the minor
bugs I posted aren't responsible for that delay :-)

The real issue will be how the transition from RH to Fedora is handled,
i.e. what's the individual user's experience. If I can install the new
version in the same manner as I installed RH 9 over RH 7, say, then I'll
go with Fedora Linux because it'easier than moving to some other
distribution. I just have to update RPMs. If I have to reinstall from
scratch and restore all my system configurations, then all distributions
are on equal footing in this regard, I have to compare them, and odds are
Fedora won't be the winner of this comparison.

I would support a "perty display" email format, if it did away with executable 
code in messages.

What about internationalization? ascii doesn't do the non-English world any 
good.  How do you write programs that are adaptable to more languages and 
character sets?

One of the Red Hat guys intimated on the fedora-devel list that the
delay was almost completely due to reasons internal to Red Hat, but he
wasn't free to say what they were.

It'd be pretty cool if you could edit how much of each previous post you'd
like to quote in your message, but not alter how that is displayed on the
other end.  Then other folks would do the same and each would view it in
their own way/direction.

However, that'd take a massive email overhaul and it wouldn't be terribly
backward compatible (unless the xml-or-whatever version came as an
attachment and, when present, the body was simply ignored) and therefore
will never happen.

It's considered bad form to end a sentence with a preposition, as in your last sentence there.  Is that worth complaining about every time I see it in this list?  Not really.

Top posting and bottom posting are matters of form and convention, but they are also about human language, not computer code.  Regarding the former, I admonish that we try to follow the rules but be very careful about making them.  This is distinct from computer languages, for which standards are essential whether good or bad.

There are some who feel justified in trying to mandate bottom posting, but historically, human language simply doesn't evolve by mandate.  (It is precisely for that reason that we aren't debating this in French.)

I can suggest only that you use a (little tiny) frame, as I've always had to open a page in order to call the server using JS.

However, this sounds like a poor design to me, updating your database on every little edit.  For one argument, people are used to thinking nothing happens until they click "Submit".  Plus it seems like a lot of work to be doing, but that may not be an issue for you.

Given that Fedora Core 1 is essentially what Redhat 10 "would have been"
minus the long-term errata/support, I'd think its reasonable to expect
the transition to be similar in character to previous major number
upgrades.

I could be horribly wrong; we'll see in a few days.

Fedora Core 1 is not the interesting release. Fedora Core 2 will be the
one to watch.  

As Dan notes, a big chunk of Fedora Core 1 was developed the "old way".
It will not be until the second or third major release will we really
have an idea which way this will go.

I'm working on transitioning K12LTSP from RH9 to FC1. So far it has
been smooth sailing.

What is the reason you don't collect all input and send it with the HTTP
response? I mean it is pretty unusual what you do there. You can still
run some integrity checks on the client side with JavaScript but sending
every field value on a separate round trip?!? It will not be easy to run
this asynchronously. Invisible yes (best shot would be frames where you
refresh another invisible frame), but then there is still a delay for
the round trip.

Which of course immediately brings to mind the quip by Winston Churchill:

     "This is the sort of English, up with which I will not put!"

Which serves to remind me that (struggling manfully to get back on topic)
some pendantic rules can be just darned silly.

Use Mutt.  Using MIME to sign PGP makes the PGP part stand out and the
message totally readable for non-PGP users.

I do use mutt sometimes... like when I can't run an X app like Evolution
for whatever reason.

It is, however, nowhere near as pretty as evolution.  :-)

I like my mail clients pretty.  For news, it's slrn all the way.. but
for mail, I want it pretty and clickable.  :-)

Better-designed MUAs (including Pine) display sanitized HTML already.

How 'bout a QuoteInfo header or attachment saying,
 Lines 3-5 and 12-14 are oldest, indented with '>> ' and written by Alice;
 lines 7 and 15-20 are next-oldest, indented with '> ' and written by Bob;
 the rest are the sender's.
Heck, that way quoted text would even wrap nicely.

But if this info were lost because Alice replied again and her MUA didn't
include it, my mailer would have to regenerate it when I replied to her.
So until everyone supports QuoteInfo (IE never), it'd be no different from
having an MUA that just reformats email for the reader.

Huh.  Another instance of David Isenberg's Stupid Network/Smart Periphery
paradigm winning out.

I have a fair amount of experience with postfix.  Not only in
authorization issues, but also in running virtuals. And would be happy
to help.  Tho admittedly I haven't used MySQL.

Did you choose to use MySQL for a particular reason?  Or because you
hoped it would be easier?

And what sort of Authorization problem are you having?  For retrieving
mail? Or for sending?  Each would suggest a different problem, and
therefore have a different resolution.

Sorry, can't help here.  I haven't tried to use telnet to do anything
more then to check the port is open, and connecting.

I had this happen once before, rather then trying to figure out how I
goofed the config, I wiped it and rebuilt, solving my problem.

*Chuckles* Guess I opened quite a can of worms.  Well, for the record, I
came to the net in very late '91.  So I was a bit green back then, and
the memory is a little fuzzy these days.  The only connection type
available to me at that time was via a shell account.  PPP didn't come
available 'til some time later.  I used email, UseNet, IRC, Tiny Fugue
(For Mudding), and Gopher.  I had not seen, nor heard of the web until
considerably later, after PPP came to be.  While I do remember using
Mosaic, I could have sworn I used something else before that for a short
time *memory getting extremely fuzzy*.  And gopher was more then alive
and well and filled with more information then I knew I wanted for those
days. *chuckles*

That is almost my point.  Occasionally, the preposition "rule" is silly and not worth following (and the best writers sometimes break it), but often it makes for better language.  Like bottom posting, it should be considered merely as a guideline or rule of thumb, but not as holy writ.

Well, 'Thin-clients' or whatever term you want to use (I think we called
them 'Earth Stations' or some such)  is a concept they are still trying
to push.  Claiming it's only a matter of bandwidth, but I'm not so sure
it'll ever take off (Just a guess of course).  

I tend to believe we'll have a mixed system, everyone will have their
own personal server, and a myriad of client systems that run off it
(TV's, alarm clocks, coffee makers, refrigerators, as well as the
terminals scattered throughout every room of the house (TV again??))
We're kind of seeing this happen now.  I wonder if it'll stick.

And 'peer to peer' was actually the buzz-word of the time.  With the
inception of thin Ethernet (aka 10base-T), and Novell-lite and I think
Lantastic (Tho I got little play time with it).  And actually, this was
12 years ago *winks* I had the fortune to be the first tech in our
company to play with 10base-T. Which thankfully, made me the 'go-to guy'
when people started asking for 10base-T and peer-to-peer based networks.

I do agree about the IT landscape being dominated by mainframes.  But my
field of expertise at the time was small business networks.  Not large
corporate solutions, so my thoughts, and memories are most likely
colored a bit.

> and there were lots of interesting projects that just died.

True, But I think even this is still common place, one only need to look
at the long list of great ideas on source-forge to find many a good idea
sitting idle and/or dead.

Who? What? Huh?  Never heard of them! *Chuckles*  So true!

When I came into the networking field (Again in '91), Token ring was
being faded out for 10base-T (Am I getting redundant?)

Again, Very true! (X.400?  Isn't that an OS?)  I'm getting the feeling
you've been doing this a bit longer then I, and on a much larger scale.

Also true. My point was more that these things follow an evolutionary
tract.  There is no way to say what the net will be like in 10 years.
But I can say with certainty that if you get a good grip on what is, and
watch what happens, one should be able to at least stay with the wave.

You don't need to watch everything, unless you're trying to get ahead of
the game.  Trying to latch onto that one thing that is going to make you
rich and famous.  If that's your goal, I say Good luck.  But if all you
want is to stay good at your job, and stay current. There isn't too much
guess work involved, and you can limit your time and resources to what
needs to be done.

10 years ago, even 16 (When I got my first 'real' computer) Microsnot
was a big deal.  When I went researching what system to get, almost
everyone told me to be sure to get something 'MS-DOS Compatible' (Tho I
eventually choose not too *snickers*)

Hmmm, Wish they made that 'Unix' instead of Linux (Then broke it down by
which ones).  I have to wonder how may of those 'others' are some
flavour of nix.  Either that, or their counting all these cell phones
that have 'web access,' email, and IM.  Which would seriously throw off
the curve.  Or perhaps they are Palm devices?

I think we can all agree it will be a nix (Are we biased?), and Yeah,
it'll topple M$, that is assuming they don't wake up and make Win 2k5 a
nix.  

Actually, anyone want to place their bets on when M$ will switch to a
nix?  (Sure their own flavour, and non open-source)

I think this issue is really only in the minds of the people that make it a
point to get upset about it. It  seems more like intimation than a real issue
when people try to enforce it  It also seems to be a class distinction. A geeky
class distinction, as if the bottom poster has more status, for being in the
"know". I never was into secret handshakes and thank you sir may I have
another, so I do my best to be a luser about it. 

Thank you

Correct?

If the answer is "javascript" for anything but enhancements to the

No.  I'm not a flamewar guy.  I prefer people not to top-post on
for completely practical, pragmatic reasons.  No religion here.

It just works, and it works better.  I can't see why people would
top-post except out of sheer laziness and disrespect for the hundreds
of readers that have to wade through it.

I first used email in a corporate environment where top posting was the norm. I
think it was the norm because the application positioned the cursor above the
quoted text. Supposing that your comfort level is what you start with, it would
make sense that those that were on the Internet, or were in a corporation that
used Unix workstations first, would prefer bottom posting.  I tend to think of
the quoted text like an appendix on a book, or maybe footnotes when I was
introduced to this new tool. . 

The piratical issue I have with bottom posting is shown in this message  "On 04
Nov 2003 06:41:54 -0800, Randal L. Schwartz said:" is at the top like a
headline. Where is it that my reply starts? Of course, after all those >, but
my 68 year old mother, and 94 year old grandmother find it confusing and
distracting.  So no disrespect intended to the hundreds, just that some people
think differently than you. I hate scrolling, if your eyes where as bad as mine
and you had to use the large font I have to, you probably would hate scrolling
through a bottom post as much as you currently hate wading through a top post. 

I claim no hundreds at my back, bad eyes, an old mother, and older grandmother
are all that I can muster. I will not dis you for bottom posting, but I don't
see what "just works and works better". 

Thank you
Russell

  Well, that's not a real surprise. S.u.S.E. has been hurting for a while
now and was in danger of capsizing earlier this year.

Hi,
It is not nearly the problem that exists in Windows.  ext2/3 writes files
with unused space between them so growth in a file is less likely to be
fragmented.  As the space used approaches the capacity of the partition,
fragmentation increases and disk I/O degrades.

Here is one tool:

http://rpmfind.net//linux/RPM/contrib/libc6/i386/defrag-0.73-5.i386.html

Cheers,
Mike

Probably better to move to an existing, successful community-based project
than put your hopes in this semi-communal fledgling.

Try something new.  It doesn't actually hurt.

Good for them.  I think SuSE is the best business distro out there, and
maybe Novell can lend it some of its waning market power.  I hope the
GroupWise folks don't strangle OpenExchange, though.

> I hope the community can make Fedora viable.

Which "the community" would that be?

It's possible.  Works for Slackware, Debian, Gentoo, Mandrake et cetera.
I wish it luck but I just don't see what it offers over Mandrake.

Did Novell somewhere along the line become Evil? I think Novell Netware is the 
best network OS, by a country mile. (I don't know how lameass winduhs crowded 
out Netware- bribery? threats?) Businesses and other users who want 
ready-to-go products and support aren't going to mess with Debian, or 
Slackware, or Gentoo, or Fedora. They don't want to roll-their-own, they want 
a nice package with all the pieces already assembled and ready to go to work. 
Both Red Hat and SuSE have put together some nice packages, including 64-bit 
servers and workstations, and preinstalls on IBM hardware. I gloat over Linux 
being the first and best with 64-bit. (on x86)

For the market they're targeting, it's a good match. Sure, us lil 
do-it-ourselfers aren't going to be interested. That's the beauty of FOSS and 
Linux- it's endlessly adaptable. Something for everyone.

And don't forget that no matter how much they pretty up GPL'd code, and how 
much they charge for binaries, they still have to fork over the sources for 
free, or a minimal media charge.

if it's ext2/ext3,
if you have large files,
then you'll always have some fragmentation,
because the filesystem divides the disks into 'groups',
and each group is split into file inodes and file blocks,
the idea being that you can sometimes get better performance if a
  file's inode and a file's blocks are physically near each other,
which means the disk alternates between inodes and blocks,
which means the filesystem has to split any file bigger than one
  group (size varies, 128M seems typical),
which shouldn't have much impact on performance,
since you can't read files that large in one chunk anyway.

I don't remember if there are any unix filesystems that benefit
  much from defragging.
my general feeling is it's a waste of time.
but go ahead and try it.

  Hear! Hear! As I fight OO.o Writer because I cannot see the codes it
places in the text, I curse the loss of WordPerfect. _That_ was productivity
software for those of us who spend most of our time writing. Frame-oriented
document systems are great for page layout programs, but letters, invoices,
reports and the like are a stream of text and I am not convinced that they
benefit from being constrained to frames. Format each paragraph separately
... <grumble, grumble, grumble>.

  Yes, LyX is top-notch for serious writing that does not need to be
delivered to a client or agency as a winWord doc, but it is not (and not
intended to be) a word processor.

Ever tried to download a SuSE CD image?

You can't. They don't offer them. 

You can download the "live eval" cd, or do an FTP Install. 

But, as quoted from their website, "Important note:
It is not possible to generate installation CDs from a complete
download. Instead, perform the FTP installation."

Talk about making it hard to determine if you really want to try the
distro or not.

I've tried the SuSE FTP install, and never did get it to work.

It IS easier for administration and pushing data around.  I would have
prefered postgresql, but I didn't want to wade through and find any syntax
changes.  I will probably experiment with that soon.

I don't think the database is the issue here.

It's Postfix.  I'm using portions of the Courier mail system for POP3 and
IMAP and the authentication there works fine.

The problem is that I can't send mail outside the local domain from remote
locations.

I just can't seem to find which commands to issue for user and pass for
plaintext or CRAM authentication.

Everything else works fine... no way am I wiping these configs.

There's almost nothing useful in the logs, either.

Kinda thinking postfix stinks at this point.

And that's how it is, by design. To do something else would be to make
yourself a relay. (Stand by for more.)

I don't know that postfix offers those as options. Have you read this
how-to: http://postfix.state-of-mind.de/patrick.koetter/smtpauth/

You see, postfix doesn't know about passwords. It checks the IP
Address to see if the sender is local or not.
If the IP isn't in the list of locally known places, then it only
delivers.

Of course, this can be over-ridden for specific circumstances, but I'm
not aware of postfix actually authenticating. 

The how-to I listed above is one way to use smtp-auth with postfix,
which uses a third program for the authentication duties. 


I hope that helps.

I was sad to see WordPerfect die.  It was my processor of choice for a

As was mentioned a tool exists. I must advise against using it though.

e2defrag did the advertised job fine, without problems. Unfortunatly
during defragmentation it packed files closely together, without any
space between them, as a result things got worse quickly. The FS I ran it
on reached about 4-5% fragmentation prior to the use of the tool,
directly after using e2defrag the drive did have 0% fragmentation, within
a month the drive hit 8% fragmentation.

Okay, two important notes. First, the close packing is only a theory, it
matches the symptoms and seems the most likely explaination. Second, this
was a couple years ago so this problem may of been fixed by now.

Until the drive hits 10% fragmentation, I wouldn't do anything.

Well, he has a point. Despite it's crashes and some problems (which in
all honesty have gotten better over the last 3 years) Windows IS more
user friendly to the average user.

Now. Let me qualify that. I would venture to guess that NO ONE IN THIS
GROUP is an "average user".

Case in point. I have a digital camera. Here's the two methods:

1> Linux.
Configure the system to see USB devices as drives. This involves
configuring SCSI emulation support, and sometimes a kernel rebuild. Once
that's done, I write a shell script to mount the camera as a drive,
download the pictures and rename them. That means finding a third party
utility that can read the jpeg image and rename the image appropriately.
Tweak files in /dev so that *I* as a user can do this. I don't want to
su to root everytime I copy pictures to my system. 

2> Windows.
Put CD that came with camera in drive. Install drivers. Install other
programs that came with camera. Plug camera in. It works. 

In this situation, both systems do nearly the same task, with equal
ease, once the configuration part is done. 

The problem is that the configuration part is beyond the capabilities of
the "average user".

I have mostly given up on Windows because I get frustrated with it. But
most folks don't have the technical skills to take up *nix. 

"Just do it" you say? Learn while you play? That's nice to do when you
have an extra machine, or when you are younger and their are fewer
things claiming your time. Most people I know have things they want to
get done on their computer, and get off the thing. As foreign as that
sounds to you and I, that's how most people use computers.

I don't carry a hammer in my back pocket for exactly the same reason. I
don't need it often enough to warrent carrying it around. 

Many of us here in this forum will say that it's not hard to use
Linux/*BSD/etc. It's not... FOR US! For someone that has always used
Windows, any *nix platform has a steep learning curve. The first lesson
being that you don't go to the store to get your software. 

I personally know many people that I would not suggest linux to. At
least, not at this time, unless they decided to hire me to take care of
their systems. :) It's a hell of a lot closer now than when I
started using it (1996), but, as Matthew Szulik said, it has a ways to
go before it will be ready for primetime with the vast majority of
computer users.

It's a web database front-end on a corporate Intranet.  People work on a
"page" at a time and these pages can be quite large with many fields to
update as well as each field itself being quite long.  I originally had a
"Save changes" button at the bottom of the page and I collected all the
changes into one long string that was passed to my Perl script for
updating the database.  For reasons I haven't yet figured out, the script
would hang permanently after the query string reached a certain length.  I
did some testing and found that updating each field after it changed was
acceptible performance wise until I could find a better solution.  On the
web, people are used to clicking a "submit" button to save changes, but
I've found that they prefer having things change immediately instead, just
like in a regular stand-alone app.
I'll create a tiny iframe for the Perl script call.
Thanks,
~M

Hi *Smiles*

Personally, I can see a use for all three forms of quoting.  

My favorite is the third, and mostly undisguised, method.  Breaking the
quoted text into logical bits and responding to each.  However this
method is best used with long, multipart posts.

Bottom posting is good in environments, such as this list, where many
threads of conversation are taking place simultaneously.  One sometimes
needs a reminder of what's going on in that particular discussion.

Top posting is handy in situations where there is only a few discussions
occurring, and the messages are relatively short.  Situations where
there's really no need to reread what has already been said, except just
to know which message it was in response to.  In all fairness, I am a
member of several mailing lists that specifically request top posting.
And it works very well in those places.

I'm curious:  were you using GET or POST?  There is a limit, I believe, on GET forms, because all the name/values go into the URL.

Of course, that depends on the app'.  With, say, a word processor, users know they have to save their work every so often.  But I'm just speaking generally. . . .

I believe that is browser dependent, some handle longer ones than 
others.  If you switch to using posts rather than gets you can shuttle 
around considerably larger amounts of data.

  What's wrong with this for every message, in all mail lists? It's what
I've always done (from the days of BBS messages to current use of the 'Net).
It makes sense.

  As you can see, there's better communications when your replies are
specific to the part of the message to which they apply.

  How about those winduhs users (e.g., users of AOL) who "top post" because
none of the original message is included in the response? Try figuring out
what's going on when you sent your message a day or so ago.

  Or, those who interweave their reply with your message. I have a
professional colleague who manages to do this with his Lookout! Express MUA.
It takes a _long_ time to figure out where his text is embedded.

  If folks were to think of how their reply is perceived by the recipient(s)
and they're interested in clearly and efficiently communicating, they'd pay
attention to what they're doing. I think that would happen some time after
folks use turn signals when changing lanes and don't cut off other drivers
as they chat on their phones. :-) In other words, "Ha! Don't hold your
breath, Richard".

You can tell Postfix to only relay for specific accounts.  

A Snippit from one of my own main.cf files:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions  = 
            permit_mynetworks
            check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/sender_access
            check_relay_domains

It would need modifying for the MySQL interactivity of course, but I
would look here.  That's about all that comes to mind at moment.

I'd argue it's the case only if they don't have to install it (which is
almost always the case).

Hmm... nope. Plugged it in, hotplug as came with RedHat 7.3 loaded usb_storage
which created a SCSI device. On My RH 9 laptop there is additional magic which
creates a directory under /mnt if needed and mounts the camera, but on RH 7.3
I have to add an entry to /etc/fstab if I want to do it as a user.

Plugged in the camera, Windows detected it as a removable drive. One out of
about three times it then refuses to disconnect the camera from the little
tray icon, and hangs when I pull the USB cable without disconnecting it.

This is true on Linux and on Windows. But it's a great myth that Windows is
easier to configure. It's only easier if someone else does it for you.

So is Windows. But for Windows, there is a) huge infrastructure which
solves the problems for users or at least hides them, and b) the
ever-so-pervasive myth that it's easier on the average user.

You got that right. The "average Windows user" gets pretty good with apps they 
use a lot- word processor, email, spreadsheet, whatver. But they still can't 
connect and install devices like scanners and printers, or set up user 
accounts (for all the good that does on a winduhs box) or upgrade the OS, or 
connect to a network of any kind, or install new software, except malicious 
crap like Gator and Comet Cursor, which are irresistible.... Linux is held to 
a higher standard. Which is lame and stupid. 

The good news it meets higher standards. Just for kicks, grab a copy of 
windoze xp, or win 2003, and compare the installation to any Linux. Every 
Linux installation I've done over the past couple of years beats the pants 
off windows. It's much faster, no more than one reboot, and the hardware 
detection is great. I think someone posted earlier about the install windoze- 
reboot reboot cha cha cha- install a device driver reboot cha- install 
another device driver reboot etc- over and over dance. It's nuts.

Fedor,

  I know too many winduhs users who know absolutely nothing about their
computers or softwre. They cannot follow explicit, step-by-step instructions
to turn off html formatting or other simple things.

  I ascribe this attitude to Microsoft selling the idea that "it just works"
and you don't have to know anything to use it. Sigh.

You may debate all day about which is better or easier.  I install on all and hardly
have any troubles with either.  I thought Red Hat came a long ways to making me
really enjoy the OS and offer me some tools that I appreciate.  The admin tools
still had a long way to go and the file system location for where binaries get
installed is still perplexing, but the system runs smoothly from install to running.
 (btw, the same for my Win XP boxes I build).    In both cases I've found using
supported hardware makes a HUGE difference.

None the less the biggest thing the leaving of RH does for me, and Linux in general,
is that it takes one of the biggest supportors and public image builders of Linux
out of the public eye.  I have read many articles today about the decision trying to
find out how this will impact my servers that I run.  I have found a few discussions
and have concluded what this means.

1.  This is a great business solution for RH.  They can focus on a solid money
making venture and not have to deal with all the calls that people have about
wanting support for the end-user product. In the long run this will affect MS more
then anyone else.  It perhaps will see one company trying to actually produce a good
Linux solution.  Yes, it cost but Business's want the support and you have to pay
for that.  I hope they do really well.

2. It will remove another Linux from the shelves.  I have no idea how many copies
were even visable to people but seeing copies in the stores always is a good thing
for future sales.  When Linux was starting to get big on the shelves with everyone
putting out a copy I stoped and read as did others.  That is fading fast.

3. It will causes all the geeks to reconsider the Linux version they want to run. 
This is a very bad thing.  As it will not help RH in the long run.  They will not
have all the new College kids who have been running RH at home promoting their
products at work.  This has been a great thing for many companies.  Give it away to
the college kids and let them learn it so they promote it.  I hope there is enough
Linux alternative server solutions out there that RH can overcome this lost.

Personally, I will have to re-think my solutions.  I have built some RH server
solutions based on the fact that a company was supporting the product and was happy.
 But paying $179/year or more is not something I find comforting or affordable. 
Many people complain about windows costing so much.  But even if I had to pay retail
for XP(I'm lucky I don't), I would buy it once and keep it for years w/o having to
pay again.  Yearly subscriptions to the OS is something I hope I never have to do.

I hope the Fedora project is something I like.  I would hate to see such a huge
change and have to learn again another Linux distribution.  Yes, all are similar,
but there are enough differences that you become annoyed.

Josh

Woah.

So many issues to address here, I don't know where to begin.

First, you're not talking about what you have to do with every GNU/Linux
distribution.  Get that clear, first.  Some are already configured
properly for this sort of thing.

Second, what you've done in your "Linux" example above is far more
interesting and flexible than what you've done with the Windows example.
There was a presumed level of interaction on your part and you went for
it; it's a whole different paradigm.  It's just as difficult (or perhaps
moreso) to do exactly what you did on the Linux system in Windows.  I, for
one, would have to check many references to write useful script in Windows
that would arbitrarily copy and rename files according some predefined
standards of naming based on date and time and file type.  Multiply that
by a ten thousand if you want it to happen every time you connect your
camera.  The approach you described in 1 assumes this is easy and
straightforward.

However, if you just want your GNU/Linux system to do what the Windows
system does in your example 2 above, then it's more like this:

apt-get install gphoto (or your favorite gui apt utility). Plug in camera.
It works.

You've got your gphoto icon on your applications menu.

And that's that.  The software does everything you can do with the
comparable Windows software (and maybe more) and has a common and simple
interface.

If we compare apples with apples, the differences vanish.

The concept of "stealing slack" is appropriate here.

If your convenience means someone else has to take more time and effort to
interact or react to you, then you've "stolen their slack".  That is to
say, your slack takes away their opportunity to slack.

Valuing laziness means being vigilant and mindful and careful so that
others may be lazy.

If people truly stopped to think about the negative impact of their
actions on others, they wouldn't be driving at all.

To be fair... AOL defaults to bottom-posting.  If you highlight the text
you wish to reply to, and hit the reply button, the text is quoted (HTML
blockquote style) and the cursor is set at the bottom of the message.

It makes it difficult to respond point-by-point, breaking up the message
(as I generally prefer)... but not impossible.  IMHO, it's still much
better than lookOut Express which quotes the whole message and puts the
cursor at the top, where everybody wants to type (Evolution does the
same, but with a different header message that encourages
bottom-posting).

My take on the whole thing:

A: Top-posting
Q: What's the most annoying thing on usenet?

Top-posting doesn't allow you to logically follow the flow of the
conversation.  In a high-traffic list (or on usenet) this is important
because folks simply don't remember what you're responding to, and don't
want to scroll all the way to the bottom of a post to find out... or
look back to the earlier (referenced) message.

For mailing lists, I'm really ok with both (although not together ;-)...
which is good, as I really have no say at all in how you quote messages
you're responding to.

For casual email, I often will top-post.  If I bottom-post, it confuses
some computer illiterates when they open the email and just see what
they already sent you.

For technical support emails when dealing with long lists of
instructions or whatnot, I almost always top-post, and encourage others
to do the same.  That is, if I email my parts supplier about an odd
motherboard problem I'm having, I top-post to their responses.  Unless
breaking it up makes sense... which it rarely does.  This lets the tech
support dude (sometimes me) easily glance back to an unbroken display of
what exactly was suggested, what the initial problem was, etc.  You
don't have to go look at some support database, or look up the old
emails you sent; it's all there at the bottom of the email if you need
to look at it.

My nickel (I'll collect change Thursday, I'm out of pennies)

Rob

Sir, please try to set your line wrap at a reasonable length.  73
characters is pretty standard... many of us keep our terminals at 80.

I've felt for a long time that Red Hat had outlived its usefulness to the
public.  I'm really glad to see them bow out right now and that, combined
with the buy-out of SuSE just might mean an end to the rpm-centric Linux
world.

Red Hat came about at a time when someone needed to show that Free
Software could be the basis of a serious computing system.  They did some
good things for PR and they helped make GNU/Linux systems more common and
accepted.

However, as the systems became more mature and the community developed
beyond the core university academics crowd, Red Hat became a restrictive
concept in the public mind.  When people thought of Linux, they thought of
the offerings from Red Hat, Inc. instead of thinking of the Free Software
movement and the vast array of possibilities.

> 2. It will remove another Linux from the shelves.

This is a really good thing.  First, I don't know how many people buy
software off shelves anymore, but it can't be too many.  The retail
software outlets of the late eighties are all belly-up and the shelves and
shelves of software at Fred Meyer have gone dry (games notwithstanding --
but hopefully the console market will wipe out that sector).  Second, the
shrink-wrapped box gave a false impression of GNU/Linux as a product
offering rather than a self-sufficient system outside any vendor's domain.

I can't tell you how good I think this is.

First and foremost, diversity is good for the ecosystem.  The more
different ways things are done, the more likely novel solutions will
evolve for every possible niche.

But second and almost as important, the destruction of a false (however de
facto the suits thought it might be) standard will ensure that people will
be educated in the general purpose concepts rather than the Red
Hat-centric system solutions.

There's still nobody out there doing general GNU/Linux support in a
sensible way.  I think perhaps it's prohibitively expensive.  Well, as
soon as we TOTALLY dispose of the idea of a living wage, we'll see it
happen.

Well, then you won't be buying Windows for a business system anytime soon.

Not if you understand the underlying similarities... the differences
fade considerably the more experience you have with more systems.

Whoops.

Looks like what you'd really want to do is this:
apt-get install gtkam
or perhaps
apt-get install kamera

...depending on your preferences.

The old gphoto doesn't support all the latest and greatest.

As I said in my first post, I prefer the split/embedded method also. It
works very well.  It's just not particle in _all_ situations.
 
For the purposes of example, let's pretend my above paragraph was all I
had said.  

Where would you split my message to embed your response?  

Most likely you wouldn't have. It would have become a bottom post
response.  As well, my response (this response) would have been bottom
posted also.

Taking my original post as an example.  I was not replying to anything
specific, just the conversation as a whole.  So I choose not to quote
anything.  And in this case it worked.  The conversation is fresh, and
no one needed a reminder.  But as you said, what if it had been a couple
days? Top posting may have been more appropriate.

gphoto2 is just the library and doesn't include a gui app like gphoto did.

Better to use either gtkam or kamera, which requires gphoto2.

No kidding.  That, and didn't everybody get tired of the way Yoda

Can someone give me a general idea about how stable is NTFS writing under
linux? 
I know that it is "experimental" and that people have gotten it working, but
does it generally work, or will it have me coughing up blood from newly
formed ulcers 2 weeks from now?
I have ~300GB of data on a couple NTFS partitions, and if I use the joy that
is Partition Magic, I'm fairly certain I will be getting an ulcer or two
anyways if I convert those drives to fat32 or something else. 
I do need to have that data with RW access, and although the data isn't
critical, I would be plenty pissed if I lost it. Backups? Well

Any other options?

Oh, and if anyone has a "top ten stupid things people do while trying to
write to NTFS" list, I would appreciate that too.
Thanks

Well, of course.  It's assumed the user knows chronological order
(normally dictated by written English anyway), and plan on
interspersing as you read.

Bottom posting is just as bad.  Edit wisely and keep moving.

That's slightly better, since you're probably going to have to skim
what was already written to put it into context.  If you don't edit
down and intersperse, you're not executing any control in the context,
so you can still lose clarity in what's being said.

That's why you have to edit a bit.  I'm demonstrating the standard

Jeme,

With todays huge displays you still use 80 charaters?  OUCH!

But okay.  I can shrink mine.  But seems a bit backwards if you ask me.

As for the rest of the comments.  I liked Red Hats approach to
delivering a product that was not on the cutting edge but still
supported the tools I needed.  I suppose not needing all the latest
greatest working on my Linux box let me choose my distro a bit
different.  But I liked that.  I left the cutting edge a while back.

As for Yearly fees on Windows.  I can buy the server and run it
forever(okay, until they stop giving me updates :-) ) without
subscribing to a yearly fee.  Yes, if I want OS support I would have to
pay, but I haven't needed that level of support in 5 years.

You are right about installing more versions of Linux would help me
better understand them but it was the decision to choose one that I
thought would be around a long time.  I would best leverage my time and
learn one well.  Even with its little issues.  I'd know them and that
would help me be more efficient.

But so goes life.  I have time to wait and see what happens in the next
few months.  Maybe I'll set aside some time and research the rest and
see what I like.

I still think having a product infront of others helps to build public
awareness that there are alternatives.  Last I checked you can still
buy Windows and Mac OS X in the stores.  But if your idea is to keep
Linux as a dream project of a free world and never a product that is
supported by a company then having it in the stores and selling a
product is not worth much.

Josh

It's been released as stable in 2.6.0-testX.

I think, but really don't know, that it might be released as stable in
2.4.23...

It's extremely limited, though.  It will not write new files or anything
like that.  It'll just write new contents to existing files, if I read
it correctly.

I've had my laptop NTFS partition mounted RW for a month or two now and
haven't had any corruption, although I haven't actually been *writing*
to it.  :-)

I still do.

I use a laptop most of the time.

My other monitor is but a 17" running at 1152x864.

My 'rescue' monitor is a 14" running at 800x600.

My 'rescue' laptop has a 12" display running at 800x600.

On my laptop (14" - 1024x768), I leave my mail client un-maximized.  I
couldn't get used to ratpoison.  This way I can look at many things at
once - gkrellm, gaim, my current IM, maybe a terminal or three.  If I
maximize my mail client that doesnt' work.  :-\

As such, for mail (and usenet - minus HTML) I really prefer HTML or line
wrapping at 72 characters.  I think most other folks do, too.

Tell that to my cell phone, or my PDA.

For that matter why would I want to fill up my huge display with a
single page of email?  

Aside from that English readers do best on lines of 10 to 20 words. 
(pardon me while I go find the reference)
Anything longer and something gets lost as the eye scans back to the 
beginning of the next line.

This is also a great risk. RH, as any other Linux in the business, used to
be smuggled in through the back door by the programmers, IT, etc. When they
had to sell it to the management, RH and its "support" made it somewhat easier.
With this decision, RH have closed this channel for themselves. Now they will
have to enter businesses through the normal business channels, the same way
Microsoft or Sun does (and Microsoft has the advantage of being "the standard").
Has RH built enough name recognition, and, more importantly, is Linux accepted
enough in business so they can survive without the "geek factor"?
RH bosses obviously must think they can. Are they right? I'm not sure.

Another problem they will face is that they will now actually have to _deliver_
some _useful_ support. In the past you bought a RH box for 70 bucks, you sort
of did not expect much support with that, and got even less. Now if they don't
provide real support, users can still use the software but not pay subscriptions.
After the initial bout of madness, RH recanted from the position that you have
to remove the Advanced Server/Workstation from the PC once support expires.
So they are very explicitly selling support contracts, and only support. If
this support is as non-existant as it was until now, businesses will very
quickly figure out a way to save $179 per year on every RH Workstation while
getting the same (zero) service :)

> 2. It will remove another Linux from the shelves.
This was pretty much happening by itself already.

> 3. It will causes all the geeks to reconsider the Linux version they want to run.
Oh, if they haven't lost ALL of their brain cells completely they'll figure
out something for colleges. They do have special programs for businesses (we
have free RH Advanced/Enterprise installs on all our server machines,
for example, not on desktops though). For colleges they'll probably do either
academic prices or free software with no support (and discounted support).

But the geeks, yes, geeks will turn away. I still don't get it why nobody
wants to make a RH-to-distro-X installer/migration tool and sweep all of the
RH home/hobbyist/geek install base in a week. Some sort of "non-agression
ethics" among Linux distros?

I use 80 character eterms... that way I can tile three across on my

Well, it'd be fine if your message simply had NO linefeeds
within a
paragraph, that way the client could wrap the display properly
regardless
of terminal size.  But when you have linefeeds in your message
AND long
lines, I (and I assume many others) get funny wrapping like
this.

You're writing to a fellow that runs Debian stable on many boxes.  Don't
talk to me about leaving the cutting edge.  You can't even see the glint
of that edge from back there.

I was under the impression that they were restructuring all of their
corporate licensing to annual fee models.

Has anyone else heard that?

Honestly, I think that's not true.  I think the better rounded your
understanding, the easier time you will have working outside the structure
imposed by the distribution and solving the problems that actually arise.
You simply wouldn't accept "its little issues".  You would have a means to
work around them.

We're not talking about learning all slavic languages to help you speak
better Romanian.  It's not that kind of investment.

I don't know anybody that can name their operating system that doesn't
have some idea what Linux is (however wrong-headed or misinformed).

Yeah?  Where can you buy OS X?  The Computer Store, maybe.  But if you're
going in there, you already know what you're getting.

That's an odd twist of my words.

But I would agree that having a product on the shelf isn't worth very much
when the very idea of the system is that it's not a product that you have
to buy off a shelf from some company.

I don't quite understand the motivation.

The geeks will do their own migration... if they want to do it.

Why put a whole lot of work into a program (and you're messing with
people's systems here, so it'd better be foolproof and fault tolerant)
that no system will ever run more than once?

It's not like anybody gets royalties for every Debian/Slackware/Gentoo
system out there.

Better let the former hatters choose their own paths and increase the
diversity.

You can feel whatever you like, but the fact is that RH was what brought
Linux to the attention of non-geek public, to the point that RH almost
became synonymous with Linux for many computer-illiterate and PHB folks.
You'll probably say that it's bad, and I don't want to get into the argument
whether it's bad or not because it's irrelevant. It just IS. Once a predominant
way to speak about something or call something is established, fighting
it is a sure way to get labeled as weirdo, but otherwise is about as useful
as flogging the ocean.

Ah, so if Jeme does not like a package manager, all other users should be
denied the opportunity to use this manager. Say, you would not by any chance
subscribe to the "be tolerant or be shot" doctrine?

Man, you must have put on your extra-tolerant hat for this message, and

but why must PC games disappear?

Do you take EVERY opportunity to learn something new, or you want things to
"just work" every now and then? Think about it. Stop yourself while doing
some regular everyday activity and think, could you have learned something
new if you were suddenly forced to do it differently? You open your faucet...
and nothing comes out. A great opportunity to learn about plumbing, to be sure.
Would you like a lesson like this every day? Immediately followed by a lesson
on electic circuits, then natural gas combusition, and then, if anything's left
of the house you could learn about infrared propagation instead of just using
remote (and it's even more learning if there's nothing left of the house, too).
But no, sometimes you just use things and would like them to work with minimal
disruption.

No, but people are paying for Lindows or Mandrake. Why are THESE guys
not doing it? If I had a Linux distribution I sold for money, I'd be
working on a "this is your salvation from RedHat crisis" tool for the last
three months.

You'll need to set up SASL authentication with postfix. Google for it. there's a howto, and some distro specific instructions floating around out there.

I think you maybe misunderstood.  I agree with what you wrote above.  And
I wasn't arguing whether that is or is not a good thing, only that it WAS.

There was a time when Linux needed that kind of boosterism to bring it to
the masses (or at least to the PHBs) and that's OK.

But the problem arose when, as you wrote, Linux and Red Hat became
synonymous.  For a time, distinguishing between the two would have been
just confusing and difficult and it was best to leave it be, but the
culture (Free Software) is more mature now and the culture (upper classes
of Western Civilization) can handle the difference, but there wasn't much
reason to make the distinction.

That's not an accurate interpretation of what I wrote, either.  It has
nothing to do with my preferences.

I just think the world is better off when "How to do XXX on Linux" doesn't
begin "download XXX-1.2.3.rpm".  The general approach is more broadly
suitable and more useful to more people.

Now, if the above were titled "How to do XXX on Red Hat Linux systems",
I'd be totally OK with it, but when the two are synonymous to the public,
there's no difference.

I'm not here to trade insults, sir.

I think the PC game market is making general purpose hardware more
expensive.  The gamer market is driving new PC and component sales.  The
hardcore gamer will pay anything to squeeze out slightly better benchmarks
or framerates or what have you.  Hardware manufacturers take advantage of
this by making the slightly bigger/faster/cooler hardware incompatible
with old systems in order to sell all-new, all-different hardware to that
gaming geek.

There used to be a residual benefit to other geeks wherein you could buy
last year's hardware at a decent price and follow an obvious upgrade path
to next year's bigger/faster/cooler.  Not any more.  Upgrades aren't a
smooth transition.  New memory means new motherboard means new processor
means new power supply means new case... sometimes new peripherals or
backward-compatible controller cards or the like.

Granted the unit prices are lower, but the waste is going up up up... and
the relative cost of going with last year's hardware isn't nearly the
great savings it used to be.

I try.  But sure, sometimes I'm lazier than I should be.

I assure you that if I had Microsoft faucets that only connected to
Microsoft or Microsoft-licensed third-party pipes, I'd be looking toward a
more general solution or, barring that, learning as many different pipe
systems as I can in order to better provide for my water when the shit
inevitably hits the fan.

But, at the risk of going off on a tangent that this thread doesn't need
to follow, I do think it's dangerous for a society to depend on technology
that few people understand.  That just creates a class of learned clergy
that pushes everyone else around.  Yes, I know that's how things have
always been.  But we've also always had war, oppression, poverty, hate,
and greed... that doesn't mean we should actively support those things.

I don't know as much about all the technology I use as I'd like, but I do
know enough to either call bullshit on those who would use it against me
or do without.  And that's as close as most folks could probably get
without living in a cave.

Right -- I had SASL configured (mostly), but I just realized that SASL
isn't compiled into the binary postfix package I was using.  Grr.

Just when I was about to recompile postfix (and maybe build a package for
it), I found out that SASL support is in the postfix-tls package (which I
was saving to install until after the other stuff worked).

So now it's installed and wants to work, but there's something going on
with the authentication method.  This much, I can do on my own.

The talk has been drifting towards "what will we do after Redhat goes
away" and "Redhat is abandoning the small users".  Again, the Redhat
in the box on the shelves is being replaced by the very similar 
Fedora Core 1.  There is very little difference between Fedora Core 1
and what any Redhat user would expect from "Redhat 10".  Probably the
main difference I have noticed is that Fedora Core has much more 
recent versions than I would expect to find in a box version coming
out about now.  Lag has dropped from months to weeks.

Since Redhat started releasing distros in boxes, high speed internet
has become much more widespread, and CDROM burners have gotten a lot
faster and cheaper.  It is true that I can still drive to CompUsa and
buy a boxed distro in somewhat less clock time than I can download a
distro from the web, but that is assuming the stores are open during
the Geek Standard Day.  :-)  Where do you go for a distro at 4AM? 
Fedora is out there, and on a lot of mirrors. 

The Fedora core release will be available in a few days, and it will
match people's expectations for Redhat 10.  Too bad it won't be ready
for the next PLUG meeting.  The news on the Fedora user's list is
that Redhat QA found a problem in Fedora serious enough to delay the
core release until after more testing.  That is a damned good reason
for a delay, and indicates that Redhat is taking Fedora seriously.
Imagine what would have happened if Redhat had just sent an image
off to the CD stamping plant - or paid for a time slot.  All the 
indications are that Fedora will be superior to boxed Redhat.

Now, if any of you feels that there must be a shelf replacement for
Redhat 10, you can get some Fedora CDROMs manufactured and boxed
and peddle them to the software wholesalers yourself.  I imagine
you could have something on the shelf by January or so, and Redhat
would have no issues with that.  Or you could wholesale sets to
various user's groups - the bake sale version of Fedora.  Nothing
is stopping us from putting copies of Fedora in every library in
Oregon.   We have a lot more options to spread Fedora than we did
with the "owned" Redhat.

As Eric said, the interesting question will be the nature of Core 2.
Redhat is still putting effort into Fedora;  after all, it is how
technology gets tested before it goes into their Enterprise product.
Fedora is unlikely to drift very far from existing ways of doing
things, or get very far behind, or piss off too many users.  Redhat
wants to keep us as "gamma" testers for Enterprise.

I am working to get Suse-style logrotate added to the Fedora Core 2.
By opening the Fedora process up the way they have, Redhat is losing
some control over direction but getting a distro a lot less affected
by NIH syndrome.  Debian and Suse users may wish to push the Fedora
team to incorporate more of their favorite features;  a "blended" 
distro might be more attractive to all.

The most likely downside is that Fedora will be too advanced and 
beta, and that we will spend more time chasing early-adopter bugs.
OTOH, unless you ran up2date immediately after an install, users
of Redhat were getting early-adopter bugs too, 6 months after the
rest of the downloading world.

Overall, I think I am a lot more likely to be pleased than troubled
with this change, a year from now.  And if I am wrong, there are so
many other tasty distros to switch to...

rescue monitor = one I plug in to the server when I need to *see* what's
happening on it (BIOS type stuff).

rescue laptop = spare laptop that can be used for testing stuff.  Ready
to load whatever OS I happen to need at the moment... it's an old P2

Funny.  I use my cell phone mostly to talk.  Yes, I can do email.  It
just isn't at the speed I want.  In a pinch only.  Then I deal with the
2" display.

I also don't fill up my display with maximize displays but my web base
squirrelmail does a wonderful job of wrapping the text.  YEAH!  It will
even go to 10 or 20 char if I really need to see some other window.  Or
look at the pretty wallpaper. :-)

I would hope if you really wanted Linux to succeed for the masses then
you would want it to be on the store shelves.  It has to be widely
available for that to work.  And not just a download.  Installed on
systems would be the best but being able to buy it and install would
be nice.

btw, I do think that Apple has now chosen to do just this.  You can
get Mac OS X and have what is basically a *nix* with a wonderful UI
and great tools.  Hmm.  Now why couldn't someone just do that same
concept with Linux.  Sure seems like it would work well.

Hello,
   I'm using VNC to export my WinXP desktop to my Linux box so I can 
some Windows apps.  Works well except that it won't show objects that 
are dragged around with the mouse in Visio (and perhaps other programs, 
I  haven't tested).  It's not the end of the world, but is there a way 
to get it to show up?

thanks,

Right :) You wouldn't quote the sig.  So it wouldn't be splitting the
message and embedding the response, you'd just be quoting, and deleting
the irrelevant portions.

Ah, and a good example of how removing relevant quotes effects the whole
point. ;) The question I was answering was "What's wrong with this for
every message?" (Referring to an intermixed quote/response.) My response
(and example) being that not all messages can be logically split.  Some
messages are kind of stuck being top or bottom posted. There's just
nowhere to split them ;)

Ah.  I just went to switch boxes for the monitors and don't have the
time for the OS load.  Good idea though.

You might want to try rdesktop  http://www.rdesktop.org/

It works on Terminal service and WinXP uses Terminal services to all
remote connections.  One of the best features to add to their desktop
system.  It is extremely more faster and better then VNC.

I use Vmware for that. The best thing about this solution is that
after I install an OS, I make a copy of the disk, then I can test
configurations or applications and I'm not afraid to fubar the system.

Which reminds me. I was playing with a Win2K virtual machine, checking out
some online games for kids (the kind that runs in your browser). After a
while I noticed that the network icon on the VM is blinking all the time.
I rebooted the VM, it immediately starts to blink again. I check task
list, nothing is running. I ran tcpdump on the host machine to see what
it's doing, and it's talking to port 80 of some host in China of all
places. Needless to say, this was the end of that VM. But all I had to do
to recover was copy about a gig of disk file from the original Win2K VM to
the experimental one.

I use SMS quite a bit because at least my friends and I use it for
quick one-offs or the occasional stuck-on-the-MAX conversation like a
mobile IM.  I just wish there was some way to SMS for free using smssend...

Thanks!  I'm using it now and it seems to work pretty well - it's 
showing all of the lines that were missing under VNC.  I especially like 
how I can specify an arbitrary desktop size so I can pack a few other 
apps around it's window.

SMS is different.  I have unlimited with PCS Vision on Sprint.  The
closest to free I know.  But what is smssend? Some app for the PC?

Great.  Glad it worked.  The best remote administration tool for
windows.  You can even remote admin all Win2K servers this way also. 
You get 2 free licenses to use as admins.  Saves lots of time when you
administrating machines in far off places.  This and 
psexec.exe(remote command console - like telnet) and remote
administrating a MS server is the just as easy as my *nix* machines.

Yes, GET was most likely the problem.  How would I submit my Javascript
variable using POST instead?  Doing a regular POST form submit would be a
PITA because of the way my HTML tables are dynamically generated...

If you want to have a javascript submit a post for you then you can do
call a javascript function like this:

submitMyForm()
{
  var v_form = document.MyCoolForm;
  v_form.action = http://WhereToPostFormTo.pl;
  top.window.open( "",postingwindow,300,300);
  v_form.target = "postingwindow";
  v_form.CoolFormName.value = "sayHello";
  v_form.submit();
}

If you call that function it will post the form named: MyCoolForm to
the v_form.action and do this all in a new window.  You can remove the
window.open and v_form.target and it will post in the same window. 
The v_form.CoolFormName.value line allows you to alter values in the
form before you submit them.

I use something similar with a lot more logic in many different cases.

Perhaps my biggest gripe with Outlook is that there is no simple way to
make it conform to bottom-posting & putting the greater-than signs along
the left-hand side; believe me, I've looked & asked Windows weenies who
should know, but Clippy ain't helpful. And it's infuriating to me
because it's just one more demonstration that MS thinks they know what
is best for me, & are making me do it their way. To paraphrase Lily
Tomlin, they've made over eight billion dollars from their software last
quarter; they don't have to care.

Subject: [PLUG] emacs: changing face color
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0311051011010.9168@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I've read pages 398-400 in the ORA Gnu Emacs book (2nd Ed.) and I cannot
change the text color in a buffer. According to the book, if I place the
cursor on that line and press Ctrl-button2 I can change the color.

  However, all that does is drop the Edit/Fonts menu and that disappears as
soon as I let up the button or ctrl key.

  Here's the environment: I'm adding references to my bibliographic database
(refDB), and it uses an emacs major-mode with syntax highlighting. Because
the emacs window background is black I find the dark red text very difficult
to read. The dark blue tags are not much better. What I want to do is change
the colors of those faces, but I cannot get emacs to do what it says it
will. Specifically, I place the cursor on the faces list for the one I want
to modify, and I click trackball button 2. Nothing happens.

  What am I missing here?

I don't understand your problem with downloads.  That's the right way to
distribute information, period: less waste, more portability, infinitely
redistributable, easily mutable.

Sure, not everybody has good bandwidth, but quite frankly, if you don't
have the bandwidth, why run a multi-user networking operating system?  And
how are you going to keep on top of updates?  Or contribute to the support
community?

Besides its proprietary elements, I have very few problems with OS X.
Apple sells upgrades in the store, I think, mostly because they have a
legacy audience that expects it.  If you're running OS X, you've already
got a relatively recent computer which you purchased from Apple, so the
shrinkwrapped software is just kind of a value added product that doesn't
have to actually make any money.

Yeah, you know, it sure would!  That's why all those shrinkwrap Linux
companies are making money hand over fist!

Let's see, your GET problem had to do with submitting the form all at once, with the normal submit button, I thought.  If it's that we're discussing, I'm not sure why your tables would matter.  You just want to keep the <form> tags outside of the tables, and use method=post.  But I'm probably missing something.

If you want to use JavaScript, the form.submit method should work--again using method=post in your form tags--as Mr. Orchard mentioned (though you might better put quotes around the URL after "v_form.action = ").

OK, I've been staying out of this, but it's all your fault I cannot resist. 
Why is this even an issue? Both my newsreader and mail clients auto-wrap just 
fine.

And real geeks don't use punchcards- they use toggle switches.

I see Sparc install CD images, and those "Live Eval" images for x86 that
I was talking about. You can't install from those. 

Nothing useful.

The "Live Eval" image runs from the CD, and is not an install CD. The
only way to install without buying from them, is to do an FTP install.

Which violates the license agreement they were purchased under. SuSE
specifically says you can't distribute their CD Images, because they
have certain software that isn't GPL'd on the CD. 

Don't argue with me about it, that's how they word it, and I've been
dealing with it for 3 years. 

If you want to argue about how this violates the GPL, take it up with
them. I'm simply relaying what they've told me when I tried to get a set
of ISO images from them.

This will allow you to change the fg/bg colors, probably not what you
want.  However, if you did, the menu you get has an entry at the
bottom: "Display Colors" which shows all the colors (your) emacs will
display.  The Foreground Color and Background Color entries in the
menu may show past colors in the submenu, or select "other" (by
releasing the mouse on "other") to run (set-foreground-color) or
(set-bacuground-color), respectively.

Use M-x customize-browse, or choose customize emacs from the options
menu, then browse custimization groups.  From here you expand the
options tree by clicking the middle mouse button (button 2) on the
+'s, or on the "Group" corresponding to the gropu you want to
see. (Open options to edit them in this same way--or open a whole
group at a time).

Poke arround in the "Faces" options tree, you should be able to find
what you need.  

Be sure to click "Set for current session" to test, or "Save for
future sessions" if you like the change.

Here is where you still believe that everyone should be a programmer.
That they can and want to pay for a high speed connection and want the
computer to be part of their daily lives.  I know so many people who
just want to print a photo and don't even care about the internet. 
They get email and occasionally look up some feature.  The 56K
connection for them is perfect.  Now how do you expect them to
download the OS of the furture and write code to make it better.

They want a tool, not a job.

Not one single company has even come close to creating an easy to use
interface like Apple or MS.  They have not choosen to put the effort
into doing such.  Why?  Who knows.  Maybe because Linux truely can't
be an end user product and they all know it.  I don't know.  I think
it can, but it sure lacks too many features to achieve that.

What it needs is a company that will promote it and create an easy to
use product.  Heck, they could even do something like Apple. 
Manufacture the hardware and build the systems.  They could then build
deals with all the CAD companies to port the software and take over
the entire CAD Workstation world from all the Unix boxes.  btw, MS has
been doing just this for the last few years and they will soon take
over the big SUN/HP workstations.  Why didn't Linux think of taking
over some of these.

There are so many ways this can be done and make a company lots of
money.  The market for low end affordable CAD systems is huge.  Or
cheap desktop system.  I do know a company that is making dumb
terminals from linux that then connect to a central Win2K Terminal
Server.

Gramps?  Hehe.  Now that is funny.   I think you need to open your
mind to what is out there and consider that the old(not me) have about
10 Trillion dollars to spend.  A recent study believes they have saved
that much.

I suppose that England and France didn't try 
to replace the church and that the church 
didn't preserve anything for posterity.  If 
the outcome of attacking the church is so 
good, why is it that nearly the fewest 
people for any state practice some sort 
of religion? Protestant denominations have 
split so many times it's hard to track 
them all and I bet noone could name all 
of them.  I'd say many Chrisitians 
understand a lot more about their faith 
than Jeme lets on.  And as far as clergy 
pushing people around, has Jeme watched 
the news lately?  Indeed many clergy are 
embarassed about sex scandals even 
though a minority among them committed 
crimes.  Who's really getting pushed 
around?

I don't think religion is the same 
as technology, diversity is better
for some things that it is for others.

And as far as intolerance and 
hatred, I'd guess that Jeme 
is not religious but still 
very capable of both.

As far as Fedora goes.  I think the 
more flexibility is becoming easier 
to integrate into friendlier Linux 
distribution where hopefully 
inventiveness will narrow the gap 
between Redhat and Debian systems.  
This use of markup language 
in config files is interesting.

I've gotten very good with rpm.  
It's not easy always to figure 
out what's needed to install 
something but rpm is very nice 
for finding where config files 
are or what package owns a file, 
etc.  With 1000's of files on a 
Redhat system, one frequently 
needs to look at a subset of 
them.  

One problem I've run into is how 
do I carefully update howtos to 
get language corrections without 
potentially losing information 
if things change?  It may be 
wise to keep the help for an 
older version of something 
around as that may be in use still 
or the old doc may clarify 
something in the new doc.  When
running multiple servers it would
be nice to link their help systems
somehow so that they know which 
docs they are supposed to have,
which ones are shared, etc.  It
might be interested to do something
like CVS and nfs for documentation
and wipe all but a central doc
server of documention.

I cheated. I used wget to snag the tree from
ftp://ftp.orst.edu/pub/suse/suse/i386/8.2/

Then I fired up an FTP server on my local LAN and did my own FTP
install. It went much faster. 

The tree is just over 6 gigs.

We don't all use your news reader or mail client.  :-)

I know slrn doesn't auto-word-wrap.  Nor would I want it to, I see a lot
of long URLs or file locations in slrn.

When folks don't work wrap and I use Evolution for mail, it makes things
complicated when I reply (one > for three lines of text).

I think it's just easier for everybody if we cut our lines down to 80
characters or less.

Rogan,

  A bit of trial-and-error solved the problem for me. First, I used the
"Faces" menu to list them all. Second, I scrolled down until I saw the ones
for this particular major mode. Third, I discovered that "button2" means
both buttons simultaneously. I thought that was "button 3", but ... it
works. Marking the text and getting the proper prompt in the minibuffer was
also a case of the blind leading the lame, but we got there eventually.

Thanks,

Rich

Hi, PLUG!

I'm pretty new to using linux, but have decided that I would really like
to get my feet under me with OSS.

I'm using Red Hat Linux Version 8 on my old laptop, and still don't
quite have a good handle on the whole linux thing.  I would like to get
a wireless networking card for my laptop, however, so I can experiment
with my laptop in the living room while my girlfriend watches RealityTV.
Could someone please suggest a good wireless card for a linux laptop?

Thanks!

Geoff

Here's one I would NOT recommend:
the linksys WPC 11 v4.
Version 3, if you can find it, has fairly easy instructions, and won't 
cause you too much angst if you're new to Linux. But I'm still working 
out how to install version, which uses a different chipset (and 
different drivers) than V3. Good luck - let me know if you find anything!

The MA311 I guess is good.  I've always 
wanted to try some Orinoco Silver or 
Gold cards, the gold has better wired 
equivalent privacy but you shouldn't 
rely on this because it's easily 
cracked.  Why watch reality tv, the 
exploitation of people on it is 
appaling.  I hope your not living 
with this girlfriend if your not 
married to her, it'll cost you and 
her a potential lifetime of happiness 
together if you are.  Don't believe 
me, look at the statistics on live 
ins and divorces.

I was down in California just last week and belately decided to take a
laptop with me. I stuck a stray Lucent Orinoco Silver card into the
bag on my way out the door.

Red Hat 9 had no trouble at all with it. I can provide more explicit
instructions if need be, but the Orinoco Silver card works great.

As I wrote in my message (which you didn't read because you block my mail
under the now proved-to-be-mistaken assumption that I don't have anything
useful to write to this list), mail and newsreaders are perfectly capable
of wrapping long lines, but when the sending client includes linefeeds
within paragraphs, the linefeeds mess with the wrapping.

This is always a problem when quoted material is involved and the quote is
separated by line indices as above ("> ").

Any card based on the Prism2 chipset would be good.  You can get a 200mw
card for under $100.  And less powerful ones for less.

A good resource for your wireless questions would be

the local wireless crowd.  They meet the last Wednesday of the month.

True - new ones crop up on a regular basis (even the ones that claim to 
be non-denominational end up being denominations after many years if they 
survive).

Stretching the analogy even further beyond what Jeme intended...

Couldn't the Protestant Reformation be analogous to the Open Source 
movement?  One of 
the main ideas of the Reformation was that the Bible should be available 
to all and in the native language of the reader.  It was a very 
anti-clerical idea - you no longer needed a priest to tell you what the 
Bible said, you could read it for yourself... Sounds kind of like Open 
Source.  And Lord knows (pardon the pun) that Open Source projects have 
a tendency to fork about as often as Protestant denominations. ;-)

...and come to think of it, the forks tend to happen for very similar 
reasons in both camps. (forks aren't always a bad thing)

Well, another way to look at it is that the truth has come out and it's

aren't we all to varying degrees... seems to be a basic feature of human

I really like my Atmel based card.  It's a Belkin card.

The Atmel chips, for whatever reason, tend to provide slightly better
range than you'll get with other chipsets.

The drivers aren't included with the 2.4.x kernels, though, you have to
go grab them from either SourceForge or Berlios, depending on the
version you want.  The SF drivers tend to be better for PCMCIA cards,
though.

OR, you can upgrade to 2.6.0-testX, where drivers are included, so you
just need to grab the firmware.

OR, just go get a different card.  I think most, these days, do have
Linux support in some fashion or another.  :-)

I've handed off GNU/Linux systems to many people who find the interface
they're given perfectly adequate.

My oft-used example of the punk house full of early twenties non-technical
girls who have a PC I built shows that if they don't like the interface,
there is enough information there to change it.  Within a month, each of
the girls in the house had her own themes and, in a couple of cases,
different window managers.  One of them even disabled the gnome session
manager and used enlightenment alone.

Do you even know what Gnome and KDE are like?  What do you want?

Well, Linux doesn't think of anything.  It's not a person or a legalized
fictional person like Microsoft.

Why didn't some predatory billionaire Free Software geek push people into
upgrades and lateral spending that wasn't absolutely necessary?  Hmm...
let's think about that one.

Now, IBM is using Linux systems to replace some big iron.  And they're
fairly successful at it.  So there is that.

No, there aren't.  Otherwise, it would be done already.

I think you have a pipe-dream understanding of capitalism and a fairly
poor grasp of real market mechanics.  Basically, you don't make money
unless you either directly funnel public funds into your coffers or have
enough money to bully people around.

They're going to need it for private healthcare.

They certainly don't need to spend it on unix systems.

Any Prism2 card is supported.
Linux-wlan-ng seems to be the most actively developed now, you can
download it from here, and check their hardware list:
http://www.linux-wlan.org/
Most distributions package the wavelan driver:
http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Wavelan.html
which supports Prism as well. Also part of the regular kernel is the
Orinoco driver. RH9 should recognize Prism and Orinoco based cards and
just load the correct driver.

This being said, I use Netgear wireless card, which RH 8 used to handle
wth wavelan driver, but RH9 after upgrade decided to load orinoco_cs
driver, and it also works (may be they merged them in the recent kernel, I
don't know).

  I've been very happy with my Orinoco Gold card.  It works great on RH 9.0.
The Orinoco is my second card.  It replaced a Linksys card which was a
little short on power.  The Orinoco Silver and Gold cards also have an
external antenna jack in case you need a little extra gain.

Make sure if you go Orinoco Gold, that you go Classic Gold.  I've got both
due to clicking on the wrong item, sigh.

Anybody know of a place in town that sells the antenna?  My walls seem to
inhibit reception by quite a bit and could use the boost.

In evo, you click on the quoted long line, goto the style pulldown which
should say "preformat" and change it to normal.  Walla!  I did above to
the "OK, I've been" line and the word "resist" was wrapped.


Evo will also add > when you click in the middle of the quoted text and

The only bad thing I found recently is when the client had numbered
items like
  1.  Number one
  2.  Number two
  3.  Number three

Evo kept "discovering" this as a "numbered list."  Every time I hit
return in after the "one" it would autorenumber the list so It looked
like:

>  2.  Number three

Minor pain that I will one day fill out a bug report on.

60 or 72 has been standard for years (print and terminal).  As Jeme
said, either 72 (or less) or no breaks works best.  No breaks does not
always work for all emailers, but its better than 85 for readability. 
72 allow for 8 char to be put in front for quotes ("> > > > ").

Another trouble is mailers like mozilla (at least it used to be) that
based the margin on the size of the window at the time you click send. 
That had me sending some goofy email for a while.

I'm going to try to keep this to clarifications, rather than going off on
this absurd topic.

I'm really not sure how you saw my remarks as an attack on religion, per
se (though I'd gladly do that when the situation warrants).  I think
you're just hyper-defensive and knee-jerk reacting.

Very few (relatively speaking) self-professed "Christians" (let's just let
that be people who believe in a divine origin for Jesus Christ rather than
those who follow the teachings of said dude) are aware of anything more
about Christ's life than appears in the King James Version of the New
Testament of the Holy Bible.  Most know absolutely nothing of the
so-called apocrypha because the "learned clergy" of the middle ages
excised the bits that weren't consistent with what they wanted folks to
believe.

The point here is that keeping the knowledge from the common people led to
their manipulation.

Are the clergy considered the most learned people in our society or
culture?  Certainly not anymore.

In fact, it's almost a prerequisite in most orders to be ignorant of or
outright reject modern understanding of philosophy, science, and history.

This seems to me to be a bare minimum requirement for a package management

because nobody can agree on when line breaks are meaningful and
when they're not, and there's no simple way of marking the
difference between meaningful and meaningless line breaks.  I
think the future will be "reader sees exactly what writer saw
when the message was composed, or sees an automatic translation
when that's not possible", but the world is nowhere near that
yet.  maybe in a couple decades, after people stop trying to make
naive separations between "content" and "style".

Assuming, of course, that the reader has the same display (and vision)
hardware as the writer.  Even if you intentionally exclude all but
sighted, literate people, displays can vary from tens of thousands to tens
of millions of pixels, mono or color, driven by a variety of software.

You've heard of PDF, surely?  Though to implement your idea properly, we'd

Have they figured out what the "new way" is going to be yet?  I have a

translation is always going to be necessary.  it's futile to
write a meta-language version of Hamlet that will automatically
be rendered correctly in any language.  this problem applies to
all forms of communication.

for limited problem domains (eg, "computer manuals"), it's
probably useful to make a form/content separation that will work
for almost-all documents and will be easy to render in almost-all
anticipated forms of communication, but rendering is a complex
enough process that every rendering will still need to be checked
for quality.

and that's just one narrowly defined domain.  any such scheme
gets awkward when you go too far outside its domain.

PDF is the wrong approach.  screenshots are probably the wrong
approach too.  (the obvious question is, what's the right
approach, and I don't really know yet.)

> Quoted text reformatted for readability,

so, umm, why did you mention that?  it validates the point that
formatting is important.  you've applied a "readability"
translation to my original text.  whether that translation is a
faithful representation of my intent could easily be a debate.
(I happened to choose linebreaks in the original text that were a
specific form of arbitrary meaninglessness, so you're
misrepresenting my message, blah blah blah.)

the point is it's a judgment call, it's difficult to automate
these decisions without solving the AI problem.  and I'm never
going to pedantically label everything with XML or whatever.

Ok, fine, but my mail reader does not have this problem. Every time someone 
gripes about "your line breaks are too long" I see it as a problem with their 
mail reader. Because mine wraps text just fine. So rather than crabbing at 
people about their line breaks, how about using a mail reader that handles 
the text intelligently? It's no different than telling people to use a less 
virus-friendly mail reader, or one that handles HTML messages safely.

Actually, I thought this was a great idea.  They cause problems so
they pay for them. It will be in incentive for them to fix them so
they don't have to pay for them.  Also, it will put help stop the
silly hackers.

We have rewards for shop lifters too.  Does that mean that the stores
are not trying to stop it from happening?

Big snip....

Basically I get that you just think Linux is for a few geeky people
and an end user ease of use product is not for the masses.  Okay. 
That is fine.

I still see many more options that can be used.  I work in an
environment that has started to use it.  And to develop software for
it.  Yes, I'll find more ways and perhaps develop some of these ideas.
I have even thought to propose some to people that could help.

You can stay in the 'Free World' as you like.  And just b/c one
company fails VA/Linux does not mean that it didn't work.  You would
need to look at their entire business plan and marketing to truely
understand why it didn't work.  There are so many factors.  Time,
Money, Contacts, Market....

We just disagree on where we would like a competitive OS to exist,
that is all.  No biggie.  I just want the tools I use to be there.  I
now see many more coming about and that is great.  But still not all. 
Perhaps close enough for me to try all development there.

      Instead, Rael is going to discuss hacks in general.
      O'Reilly has also sent a care package of goodies to
      give away which I will bring with me.

      P.S.  I highly recommend O'Reilly's Hack Series of Books.
      I have personally found them very useful, and well worth
      the money I paid for them.

the "net" command.   Does anyone know the package that has that

Because that would just be too easy. We need to get people to stop using
these fancy new programs and go back to the old standbys. This damn vi
editor is too fancy - people should just stick to good old, tried but
true ed.

You're getting it all wrong.

I'm saying that the "end user ease of use product" IS for the masses and
it's here.  But it's for general purpose computing systems, not web
terminals.

No point in putting a system that requires administration in the hands of
people that have no intention of doing any.

The problem is capitalism as a whole.  Unless you've got a way to directly
funnel public funds (tax money) into your coffers, you can't succeed in
business.  The software businesses have worked around this somewhat by
using public funds to enforce their monopolies via the copyright fiasco of
the last century, but without that kind of state protection, there is no
way to profit.

That doesn't even make sense to me.

They are, aren't there?

What's missing?  I asked that before and you ignored it.  What is NOT
there in existing Free Software?

I agree with this.  So many factors.  Rembember Loki?  In that case, the

Keith Lofstrom says:

Toggle switches?  You had toggle switches?  We had to program with wire
nuts, and glad to have 'em, too.  Hand twisting wires with mains voltage
on them sucked.  Then all those kids came along with new-fangled soldering
irons and plug boards.  Where's the adventure?  But toggle switches - we
would have died for toggle switches.  We nearly died anyway, what with 
all the electrocution and such.  You aren't a Real Programmer until you've

I've been extremely happy with my Avaya Gold World Card (or whatever

card is.

I need to extract some addresses from evolution, but the database type
is unknown to my RH8 box, anybody out there know?

He owned a business that sold software and had non-owner employees, so
that's an oxymoron.

... which is about Microsoft offering rewards for the arrest of the

Good idea in the abstract.  However, how do you prove that person X
wrote the virus code, as opposed to having the "evidence" planted on
their insecure machine by a virus writer and their friends?  Imagine,
person X pisses off the virus writer community.  Person X is not a
10/10 super security guru.  Person X's machine is cracked, virus
development material is left in an obscure directory, the virus writers
drop a dime on person X, and get the reward.  

Yeah, the script kiddies aren't nearly so smart, but the twisted
geeks that write this material might be.  While I think a good and
careful computer forensics team would be able to see through the
scam - there would be pieces that don't fit the puzzle - I wonder
how many forensic teams are that careful.

The other worrisome part of this is that a productive virus writer
probably uses Linux boxen for development.  Much better programming
tools.  When the twerp is caught and the fit hits the shan, there
will be those that blame all this on Linux rather than the twerp
who abused it.  We should be ready to counter that.

Alright!  Finally, the voice of reason.

I think, in addition to using ed, we need to work on abolishing HTML.

It is evil.

Unless you're some kind of BerkeleyDB guru, there are two known ways to export 
contacts from the Evolution address book:

1. Save them as Vcards. Which you can then open in another program that lets 
you do what you want with them, if it supports Vcards

2. Import your addressbook into Netscape, then use Netscape's features to do 
stuff.

Not the best answers, but as far as I know that's about it.

apt-proxy is supposed to work with apt-rpm.  I haven't used it.  I have 
built local repositories for apt-rpm, both rsync of redhat updates and

Subject: [PLUG] linux issues, identical hardware, one works with linux, the other just with windows. Solar flares?
Message-ID: <E1AHbfa-0005bH-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

Okie dokie. I seem to have a possessed machine that just doesn't seem to
want any version of Linux on it. Sorry about the length, but I wanted to get
a lot of details in here.

In a nutshell, windows 98+2k3 works on the box that I want to put linux on.
I can stress test it without problems and it has been stable as far as I can
remember. No hardware errors showing up in event viewer, etc. I don't think
it has ever blue screened under 2k3 (uptime was 62 days when I rebooted to
put linux on) 98 is a POS, but I had it running on that box for some reason
about 6 months ago, I don't recall it being any more unstable than usual.

Linux distros don't seem to work. I've tried 2 so far.
Now, what makes this interesting is that I have the identical board with the
identical power supply, case, floppy, et al (dif proc speed 2100xp vs
2400xp, same board + bios rev too). Linux works fine with that, as far as I
can tell, none of the errors the bad machine is getting.
So, same hardware, except the "good" box has an audigy and a scsi raid card.
Different video card ("bad" box having an old matrox, "good" is a radeon
7500).
A gig of ram in the good one, 256mb in the "bad".

I've tried Slackware 9.1 and redhat shrike.
Redhat wouldn't even install, it kept looking at hdd when the cdrom that it
booted from was in hdc. When I finally got pissed, I burned another copy and
put 1 copy of cd #1 in each, it got to past the language selection, and then
promptly hung. Verified the iso checksums and gave up, went to download
slackware. 
Also had some bread errors before it hung. 

Slackware installed, seemed to work fine, although on startup I get
different variations of about 20 uhci errors followed by the helpful comment
"very bad". Still, slackware booted, I could login, launch gnome or kde,
play with the gimp and nibbles. No problems. 

That is, until I tried create a new fat partition out of free space on the
drive. Created, changed type, but when I tried to write the change to the
drive, it came back with the error, unable to read partition information,
etc. Cussed, reboot, checked fdisk - partition was "created" (and in the
right place apparently, I didn't overwrite another partition). I formatted
it, began to copy some stuff into the new partition. A couple minutes later,
a kernel panic (with blinking keyboard lights even) and when I reboot, all
the partition info was scrambled. Lilo came up, the penguin shows, and then
the kernel panic when trying to load the root file system. It was reiser_fs
if that has any bearing. 
I tried a couple of recovery tools, but nothing could recover the data on
any of the partitions. I took a look at the new partition (hex) I had made
at the end of the disk and LILO "stuff" showed up right at the beginning.
Normal? I don't think so, perhaps on the boot / active partition, but I
don't see why it would be on a partition w/o an os. 
Anyways, I'm confused, I even opened up a can of air on the case and
reseated ram and the vid card. 
Any ideas?

Everything points to hardware, but the damndest thing is I haven't seen any
problems under windows. . .

Because any time I try a new mail reading program, it causes
enough problems or slows me down enough that I end up reverting
back to my old system, which lets me triage incoming messages
very quickly in a way that makes sense to me.  (One keystroke per
message.  System is based on MH and Emacs, with MIME processing
disabled.)

Since I'm nobody in particular and there's no pressing reason for
us to communicate, feel free to ignore my peculiar formatting
desires.  Well, parts of the world are still being run by
technology dinosaurs who are comfortable with their own archaic
email systems, and it might be helpful to cater to their whims.

But I'm sure in another couple months they'll all be dead, so go
ahead and send email as RTF or RDF or PDF or whatever format
people think is cool these days.

hmm... I hear Microsoft Word is getting popular, maybe there
should be a mail program that will handle that intelligently and
safely.  The easiest way is probably: start up an isolated
virtual machine to render the document, then scrape bits off the
virtual screen.

I revere old technology dinosaurs, bless your saurian ole selves. I'm still 
having trouble understanding why it is so difficult for a mail reader that is 
so great in every other way to wrap text messages. Is the code not open? Can 
it not be modified? I can open a message in Kmail (and most other mail 
clients) and squish the window to a narrow width, and the text rewraps 
itself. How nice! I, the user, control the display. Isn't that one of the 
primary points of Free Software? User control?

So does the fact that I have stock options in the company I work for make it

Options mean nothing.  If you have control of voting stock and some
employees do not, you are equivalent to the "morally corrupt" owners. If
you and every other employee have control over voting stock that pays
dividends, then it's slightly better.  If all of the premium voting stock
belongs to all the employees, then it's just about acceptable.

Do you just want to use bandwidth more efficiently? Or do you actually
want to give user A 80% priority and user B the remaining 20% of
bandwidth? Because IIRC squid doesn't do traffic control. You want to
look at the kernel. Documentation for the concept is at
http://www.lartc.org/ look for the "Dive In" link and read chapters 9
and 15.

If you just want to make more efficient use of your existing bandwidth
by use a web proxy, then you can either: a) configure all your machines to
use squid; or b) set up transparent proxy. In the case of (a) there
isn't much to configure in squid other than to change the default rule
that basically denies all traffic (so as you don't run an open proxy by
default). The squid.conf file is pretty self-explanatory. For (b) you
should read section 15.5 of the lartc (see above).

If you have any questions about traffic control, feel free to ask. I
just recently finished setting up my own firewall to allow constant
bittorrent traffic at maximum bandwidth while still being able to
browse the web just fine and have zero latency ssh sessions in and
out. In other words, certain protocols take priority and are guaranteed
bandwidth, but in my case any leftovers are fed to any consumers still
around.

Okay, who wrote this junk!  You have to acquire an anti virus company
to improve your security?!?!?!?  I think it would be better for
Microsoft to leave the best anti-virus companies independent and
simply let anti-virus companies see the guts, all of the guts, of 
Windows.  These anti-virus companies do not need to be run by
a corporation that believes in security through obscurity.  
That money.cnn.com article is odd this way.  There's another 
risk.  For the virus writer hearing about the bounty 
he/she might think, "geez, I'll just give Microsoft the fix 
and collect a cash reward shortly thereafter introducing 
another virus to get another cash reward..."

Gates could impress us by trying to adjust his Windows business
plan to involve more openness and through that develop a product 
with greater value.  If he hadn't killed the market for non 
Microsoft programs under Windows his system would be doing 
much better right now.  His other option is to break his
company into a software company and an OS/Internet 
specialized company, he'll never do that though.  He has 
more than that these days though doesn't he?  He should 
just do one thing well instead of a lot of things poorly.
He has a very bad habit of buying out his competition.

Hopefully changes in technology that bring the power community
that's in a text console configuring things by hand and the gui
community that pushes a graphical button to do nearly the same 
thing closer together will help make Mike Szulik's dream of 
OS'es being worth very little come true. This will shift 
profit to providers of quality products over providers of 
merely the best advertised products.

Gate's is choosing to be desperate.  At any time he can
stop his anti Linux/OSS FUD, he himself apparently liking 
Linux, and most likely end up earing more money because 
of improved credibility telling the truth about OSS, 
Linux, and the various products of other competitors...  
Somehow, I keep thinking the software business is a 
people business.  His asbergers must be really severe,
he seems like an animal that thrives on squashing his
competition instead of allowing competition to improve
his product by playing fair.

Okay, I've had problems with certain fujitsu 
hard drive where it will not partition properly 
period but I don't know why.  The uhci errors 
refer to the usb.  Maybe go to 
http://www.linux-usb.org for help?  Make sure 
with the video card that it doesn't draw more 
power than the slot it goes into is designed 
for and watch out for the possibility 
that a card does not work on a particular board 
because of some bug either in the card or the 
board.  If one type of card works and you can 
swap parts off of identical motherboards, 
see if you have trouble only swapping out the 
matrox card.  See if you can possibly isolate 
the trouble to a hardware combination or a bad 
part.

Get a memory tester, Shrike runs with 256 megs of ram 
but not if the memory is bad.  Windows normally doesn't 
install if ram is bad, but I bet it could.  Another 
thing with Athlon's is that people on the list have 
been seemingly concluding that the clocking is very 
sensitive.  Is the clocking the same in the good 
system verses the bad?  BTW, there's a free memory 
tester at http://www.memtest86.org or was that .com.
Check the seating of your cards and if you clean the
board or components, make sure they are completely
dry before applying power.  With ATX it takes longer
for the boards to power down than AT, so it's easier
to fry things by touching them too soon.

The keyboard lights flashing means you can't mount 
the root partition, I've run into that with LTSP.  
I don't think it can signify something else, but 
I could be wrong.

Now as far as the usb goes, can you disable it?  It
may be a buggy implementation of usb 1.0.  If it
were USB2 it would be EHCI which you can get cards
for now.  I don't know which one to get if you need
usb2.  Another thing to look into is a custom
kernel.  Linux can mostly ignore the bios and 
set devices up directly based on I believe how
the kernel is compiled.  I've got the D845PEBT2
Intel board but it's basically impossible to get
the built in sound working.  If I could get the
same basic board without the sound card instead
throwing a live in there, that would be much 
better.  

I've run into problems with shrike and power 
management.  The recommendation seems to be 
to upgrade to kernel-2.4.22 to get around 
this issue.

It's a lot easier if the program can understand 
wrapping at eighty characters.  The vi editor has
set textwidth=80 or something similar.  This
is a better approach than Window resizing also
being more accurate.  How exactly do you size
a Window to get eighty characters per line of
text?

Smashing. I selected a few hundred contacts and then told evolution to
send them as vcards, which it did in one big file. I get a fixed length
columnar output from this. Import into word processor, convert to table
specifying number of columns as the number of lined entries, and viola,

Mozilla won't do, and I wasn't willing to put Netscape on just for

the best answers are the ones that are workable. As far as I can tell,

Sorry if this is a tad OT, but I need some quick advice from you network admins.  What are the going recommendations for firewall software and virus software, on Windoze boxen.  This is for an extremely end-user demographic--farmers on dial-up, in fact--so it has to be easy to install.  (And hardware firewalls are out, because these people could never be persuaded to buy one.)  Probably around 50% Win98 and 50% XP.

I'm thinking Zone Alarm and McAffee, so correct me if that is not up-to-date:  for all I know, XP comes with a firewall.

I ask on behalf of my father, whose telecom firm resells an ISP service which has been hit hard lately by all the Winvirii.  I've finally convinced him that he needs to block the offending systems until they shape up (which is a real struggle for him as a competing service provider).  But he wants to know what he should suggest to his customers for securing their Winmachines, other than just OS patches and safe email.

Thanks in advance,

Whatever you say clergy basher.  All clergy are 
dumb unsophisticated people except for the ones 
who are lawyers, scientists, philosophers...  Oh 
and I've never read the King James bible because 
it's a poor translation compared to the Jerome 
or better yet the original greek, hebrew,
and aramaic texts.

I'd say your being a little arrogant claiming the 
assumption that you don't post useful things to 
the list isn't true or that this assumption has 
been made by others.  Course, I might start making
this assumption about now.

The biggest problem with Galileo for example is
that he personally attacked his best friend who
happened to be pope.  I will point out though, 
he was merely humiliated by the church which he 
arguably needed to stem his excessive pride.

I'll go halfway with you on that one. ZoneAlarm does a pretty good job,
but gets tight when "upgraded", even blocking out all traffic in one
case for me. It's great for the price.

After using McAffee for years I got too irritated with their poor
customer service. I've wasted too much money on online upgrades that
didn't work to be happy any more. Customer service at McAffee hasn't
been willing to refund for non-working upgrades, either. I'm very happy
with the Symantec product, either SystemWorks or just the antivirus,
they both work well, update definitions in the background and are easily
renewed annually.

That's what I do, anyway.

Too bad a hardware Firewall is out.  But since it is, Zone Alarm would
be my first recommendation. It is even free for personal use. 
Something that may be on the list.  The professional version gives you
a lot more flexibility and allows for custom setups.

As for anti-virus software.  I think McAffee or Norton is fine.  No
idea which is 'really' better.  The firewall actually will block most
problems.

XP has a firewall but is not a good choose.  Supposely MS wants to fix
this in the sp2 release but no idea if they will.

Oops- forgot this point. XP DOES have a firewall. 

I can't trust it though. It's like putting the fox in charge of the hen
house, if you get my drift. ZoneAlarm will block all of the MS "stuff"
that they want to pass down the pipe, the XP firewall doesn't seem to
see the MS internal traffic...

I'm sorry, but ... BUZZ .. wrong answer :) *Looks up at the quote he's

The attached script makes a bootable dvd image from the ftp tree. It does not

Dear PLUG:

I am very confused here.

Do I nominate Michael's post for the most absurd off topic,
knee-jerk-to-nothing-in-the-content "post" of the year, or do I shoot
for the what-the-fuck-poster of the year?  Can he win both in one post?

In 29 years of Internet and USENET I have rarely seen mental illness so
brilliantly displayed.

Can someone please sneak in and see what he is doing *when* he posts, or
maybe 20-30 minutes before?

Is this just a utter lack of comprehension, or is this pre-formated
responses to gain karma ala Slashdot bots.

Or is Michael posting to random groups?  Does he do this elsewhere?  Is
he blind and clicking on sender and not Subject?

Please help me convert his response to a possible rational response.

Does it seem like I am picking on Michael?  Yes.  But before you defend
him in anyway, please read the sequence below.  I *wish* it was unique. 
I wish it was unique *today*.

And no, I have not taken near enough mind altering chemicals to start
defending Jeme politics and philosophies, though I agree with his
comments below, but that has nothing to do with Michael's response.

Zone Alarm is the one I recommend all the time.  Assuming I can't
convince them to get an old 386 for next to (if not) nothing and put a
small Linux on it ;)

I agree here, Norton is about the best in both stability and
compatability. I've heard more horror stories about McAfre and PC-Cilin
then I could possibly remember.

Not quite what I meant. (But useful anyways.)

They were supposed to hammer out the rules for "Community Involvement"
in the development and maintenence of packages.  They have yet to
release anything on how that is going to work.

The best use for ZoneAlarm is for the stuff going out.  It catches all
sorts of programs that try and phone home.  One of the easiest ways to
spot spyware.

I also recommend AdAware and SpyBot Search and Destroy.  Both will help
you track spyware/adware/backdoors.  They both seem to miss some things,
but the two together gets just about everything in that field.

because emacs doesn't have an easy distinction between data and
presentation of data.  what you see is what's there, mostly.
emacs will wrap lines, but it doesn't wrap at word boundaries.
to get a buffer that looks word-wrapped, you have to insert
actual newline characters into the data (and redo it all whenever
the window width changes).

modifications like that tend to have all sorts of nontrivial
effects.  for instance, it makes it awkward to copy and paste
regions of text verbatim, which is an issue when the text has
some fixed format, like patches.  (instead of editing the data,
you can play games with things like text properties, but that has
problems too.)

generally, I don't like having too many layers of interpretation
between me and raw data.  the less processing involved, the fewer
surprises (and bugs).  which means I get to learn how to read
text that's been encoded oddly.  or just delete it unread when I
don't feel like puzzling it out.  most of the hard-to-read
messages are spam anyway.

sure, it's all fixable, but it's not really worth the effort yet.
I think the hard part of open-source software is convincing
maintainers to take a code change.  making your own mutant
version of a program is usually a losing proposition, since it
adds nontrivial amount of effort to every program update.

                       "Novell eats SuSE. Now what?"

   Thursday, November 6, 2003--So, what to make of Novell's purchase of
   SuSE:
   http://news.com.com/2009-7344_3-5102360.html?tag=nefd_top for $210
   million in hard American cash? A lot of punditry already has been
   committed on the subject, including four items alone at the CNET link
   in the last sentence. But the comment I like best so far is by Nat
   Friedman, who writes on his weblog:
   http://www.nat.org/2003/november/, "La la la. Hacking the planet . La
   la la." The three central words link to Novell's press release:
   http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/2003/11/pr03069.html on the
   matter.

   Of course, the release mostly is PR jive. For example, Novell wants to
   provide "enterprise-class service and support on the Linux platform".
   Like Red Hat, HP, Sun and IBM don't all do the same thing. But a few
   items stand out, such as the phrase "from the desktop to the server,"
   which appears three times in the release. Also, IBM has invested $50
   million in Novell convertible preferred stock. There is accompanying
   mumblage about commitment to commercial agreements between IBM and
   SUSE LINUX, but there has to be another reason. What is it? News that
   IBM won't buy Red Hat?

   By the way, I always found the weird upper and lower case SuSE name
   charming. Kinda like NeXT that way. I hate SUSE LINUX. It screams at
   me for no reason. Hey, if you don't like your name, leave wrong enough
   alone.

   Who will buy Red Hat, anyway? Isn't that the other shoe here? I mean,
   isn't Red Hat the only buyable distribution left? I've been asking
   folks about that, and what little agreement I've found all seems to
   point toward Oracle.

   In June 2002, Oracle, Red Hat and Dell (yeah, Dell was involved... who
   knew?) announced Unbreakable Linux, a few days after Caldera,
   Conectiva, SuSE and Turbolinux announced UnitedLinux. (We covered both
   here:
   http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6120 at the time.) Two
   months later Turbolinux sold itself to a Japanese company and
   disappeared. A few months after that, Caldera turned into SCO and SCO
   turned into a volcano of anti-Linux FUD. Now, Novell's buying SuSE.
   With UnitedLinux so thoroughly divided, one's mind naturally turns to
   what Matt Szulik said:
   http://siliconvalley.internet.com/news/article.php/1276851 at the
   Unbreakable announcement: "I guess you could call this an
   'Unbreakable' partnership."

   Just how unbreakable, Matt? Shopping for a ring these days?

   Speaking of SCO, which I hate to do because the veins in my neck might
   burst, I received a press release this morning from SCO's PR agency,
   bragging about how CEO Darl McBride will be giving a keynote at
   Enterprise IT Week's CDXPO:
   http://www.cdxpo.com/ in Las Vegas later this month. To be unfair,
   there are no less than eight keynoters at the thing, so it's not that
   big a deal, but still I have to wonder: Are they insane? The press
   release actually brags on this one-liner from Darl: "The Internet
   created--and creatively destroyed--great wealth. It also created a
   culture legitimizing intellectual property theft."

   Let's see a show of hands. How many among you would like to turn back
   the clock to when there was no Internet and your intellectual property
   still was, presumably, safe? Thought so.

   Back to Novell. I've known the company for a long time, since nearly
   the beginning. I even consulted for them for a while. I think Novell
   gets scant credit for a number of huge innovations, starting with
   changing the network conversation from an argument between proprietary
   locked-in silos to an agreement around the need for a roster of
   interoperable services, including file, print, security, directory,
   management, messaging and so on.

   The Novell people responsible for changing that conversation, Craig
   and Judith Burton, are two of my best friends. In fact, we became
   friends because I was an extreme fan of the jujitsu moves they put on
   everybody else in the market at that time. It was amazing to watch.
   Remember Digital's OmniNet? Wang's WangNet? 3Com's 3Server? IBM's
   Token Ring? Ungermann-Bass' NetOne? How about Microsoft's MSNet?
   Remember the whole debate between fat and thin Ethernet cabling? Or
   the various expensive proprietary forms of wiring IBM wanted you to
   buy to replace whatever it was your company already had spent hundreds
   of thousands to pull through your buildings? No?

   Thank Novell. They blew all that up. They played rope-a-dope with
   everybody else in the category, and when it was over Novell was King
   Network Rat, in spades. Nobody else even was in the game.

   Then, somewhere along in there, Novell CEO Ray Noorda turned into
   Captain Ahab and Bill Gates became his Great White Whale. Ray wanted
   to kill Microsoft. For that he bought WordPerfect, so he could compete
   in office suites. He bought UNIX from AT&T and rebranded it UnixWare,
   so he could compete in operating systems. He bought Digital Research
   so he could get DR-DOS and needle Microsoft about ripping it off.
   Worst of all, he got rid of Craig and Judith. When he retired, he left
   a company with a roster of moribund acquisitions and a huge legacy
   business that continues to sustain it to this day.

   People have been predicting the death of Novell for ten years. But
   NetWare's customer base is shrinking like the ice cap on Greenland.
   One correspondent writes, "I have one huge client that's still running
   on Netware 3.11 The hardware is so old that I have to go to
   electronics outlets to find parts".

   So the first person I wanted to talk to about the Novell-SuSE deal was
   Craig Burton. He's not optimistic:

     My friend, Doc Searls, likes to say "You are where you come from",
     and I agree. Companies have legacy DNA that's very hard to change.
     Novell may be in Boston, but they still come from Utah. And they
     still come from NetWare. Look at their Web site. It's still mostly
     about NetWare.

     I don't have much faith that they'll ever figure out how to be an
     OS vendor. They tried with Btrieve, with UNIX, with Digital
     Research. And failed every time.

     It's not just about being an OS company. It's about being a
     developer-centric company, which you have to be if you're an OS
     company. I was the one who bought Btrieve when I was there, with
     the intention of making them a developer-centric company, and it
     didn't happen. It took two years after the release of NetWare 3.x
     before the development platform from Novell became available to
     developers. Microsoft is serving developers two years before the OS
     ships. You can get Longhorn specifications right now and it's two
     years away. The difference between the way Microsoft and Novell
     have done the OS business in the past is frightening.

   But his take isn't all negative.

     They can be active in services. Not only file and print, but
     identity, security, presence. They can do the next generation of
     file services. iFolder is a real good redirector for files services
     for the Internet. It's way too NetWare-centric right now, but
     presumably with these acquisitions they're going to get away from
     that. And they have a really cool print server, I think it's called
     iPrint, which is integrated in with directory. They don't have a
     metadirectory yet, and that's a problem. I don't know what they're
     going to do about that.

     I really would like to see them succeed. It's just kind of late. I
     hope for their sake that they're going more for the infrastructure
     than for the client. If the client is their top priority, they've
     got a tough row to hoe.

   When I asked him why, he said this:

     The issue is symmetry. Microsoft for years pushed the idea that you
     needed symmetry between client and server. Both had to be the same
     breed. They needed to relate only to each other. It was a lock-in
     strategy.

     The last Longhorn was Cairo, which was going to be the hammer that
     hit the anvil that caused the customer to believe that you needed
     the same platform--symmetry--on both sides. Linux and Apache blew
     that all to pieces and continue to do so.

     Yes, the client side of Linux has made progress, but not a lot. Not
     like the server. But since you don't need symmetry anymore, that
     doesn't have to matter. And there's lots of opportunity, as well as
     success already, on the server side.

     On other issues, they will gain a lot of new management in Europe,
     which is both good and bad. It's good because Europe's tough to
     break into, and it's bad because they're on a different timeline.
     And just think of the cultural issues. Germany vs. Utah. Open
     source vs. Novell's past business.

     So the question is: Can they change where they come from? And
     that's a tough one. It's something that every CEO after Ray Noorda
     has failed at, so far. Only time will tell.

   To balance that, I got a very positive response:
   http://governmentforge.org/archives/000328.html from Tom Adelstein, in
   GovernmentForge:

     Those of you who recall a rather contentious company called Novell,
     should clear your memory cache. Ray Noorda moved over to SCO some
     time ago and took with him the likes of Darl McBride. The Novell we
     once knew and about which we scratched our heads changed some time
     ago. During that time, the media focused little attention on
     Novell. So, we may need a refresher course...

     Consider Novell a new company with new management, key personnel
     and a bright and friendly smile. The sincerity and professionalism
     looks very authentic. It comes from the confluence of Cambridge
     Technology Partners who merged with Novell in 2001 and the
     dedicated survivors of the old regime.

     I've spoken at length with people in Novell management and even
     took their course on Linux with Novell services.

     Anyone can download it for free from here:
     http://www.novell.com/training/linux/linux_linux_book.pdf. You
     should find it a relatively short but extremely enlightening piece.
     After today, it should become required reading for the Open Source
     Community.

     I have done my due diligence on Novell and like what I see. I read
     all their SEC filings, tracked down management histories and read
     everything on which I could get my hands. I even did calculations
     on their stock prices, did timeline analysis of their financial
     statements and coordinated them to significant events.

     This is a new management team, very bright, very intelligent. They
     had a regime change and that brought the company back to life. It's
     a brand new, very exciting group of people. A new company and a
     model for others to follow.

     If you have any lingering pictures of Novell, put them on the side
     of the road. This is all goodness for OSS. I can also tell you I
     was skeptical going into my review. So, this was a pleasant
     surprise.

   So those are your two extremes.

   Most of what I've been getting is guardedly positive, such as this
   statement from Phil Windley:
   http://windley.com/, former CIO of Utah:

     I've been hearing some rumors of this for a few weeks. Nothing
     specific, just "Novell's moving big into Linux."

     Clearly this shows Novell is looking [to] be a player in a way that
     they could never accomplish by just selling applications and system
     add-ons for Windows. The acquisition of Ximian gave Novell a cache
     of great Linux products, but that doesn't really help them out of
     their funk. Novell still has a large installed base of NetWare
     customers that they need to migrate to something with a future or
     lose to Microsoft. Now they've got a server they can use to
     backfill Netware. They can't do that with a Linux server that they
     don't have pretty tight control over, so buying a Linux company is
     a natural choice: it gives them a product, lots of Linux expertise
     to tap, and some credibility.

     This is probably a good thing for Linux users in general because
     there's likely to be some good work done on making Linux work well
     inside the corporate IT shop. Most large IT shops don't have the
     luxury of being a pure Linux or Microsoft shop. They have to be
     both. Linux has made some great strides toward being a good
     corporate citizen. This provides more pressure in that direction.

     I guess it's hard to find a downside.

   Dave Aiello, president of CTDATA:
   http://ctdata.com/ (a Linux-savvy company that builds database-driven
   Web sites for companies in the New York Metro area) sees the buy as an
   Open Source community play:

     I think you have to look at the SuSE acquisition in the same light
     as the release by IBM of Eclipse as a free product. A network
     effects calculation is being done here. I think IBM looked at
     Eclipse and said, this product has greater value to us if it's in
     the hands of [the] Open Source community than if we keep selling
     it. If we keep total control of it, we have to enhance it, market
     it, and provide for the development of ancillary products from our
     own resources.

     If the product is backed by an Open Source community, the founders
     get the benefit of free labor, free product enhancement ideas, and
     ancillary product branches that they don't have to support unless
     the company has an overwhelming interest.

     I think this is what's happened with Netscape->Mozilla and
     WebSphere Studio App Developer -> Eclipse. It is what Red Hat hopes
     will happen with Fedora, and ultimately, what IBM is hoping for
     with SuSE. I think IBM's ultimate interest is in having a credible
     alternative to Red Hat that they have substantial influence over,
     without having the overhead of developing internally.

     This is more about addressing customer CIO level concerns about not
     repeating the Wintel single source market than about the fact that
     IBM doesn't like Red Hat's Enterprise Linux strategy, per se.

   Allen Harrell, an IT outsource specialist in Arizona, says this:

     If Novell can make Linux work across the enterprise regardless of
     size, this is a good thing. After all, Novell was the first company
     to get print services running across the network. Novell 6's client
     for Windows machines is a slick piece of software. Letting you
     access all the files on your network regardless of type -- an area
     where Windows fails at miserably. I have a Red Hat 6 drive in my
     machine right now that the BIOS picks up but Windows doesn't even
     list it.

     NetWare also logs off all the clients and notifies you, which
     allows them to keep running while it reboots, which is an area
     where Windows gives you the blue screen of death.

     With Red Hat getting out of the personal OS biz:
     http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/33760.html, Lindows will get
     some more traction. I mean, hell, if you can buy a Lindows computer
     at Wal-Mart, those folks who were afraid of 'trailer trash' showing
     up on the Net have a real good reason to fear now.

   One upbeat response I've been hearing is this deal will be good for
   Debian. So I asked Debian co-founder, Ian Murdock CEO of Progeny:
   http://www.progeny.com, for his take. Here's what he said:

     My initial reaction is that this is very good news for Linux, both
     [the] industry and community.

     Industry-wise, the distribution world has started to head down a
     dangerous road this past year, and this move certainly promises to
     shake things up quite a bit. My hope is it will shake things up
     enough to allow a course correction. I'm optimistic, because from
     what I've seen, Novell is doing all the right things. They seem to
     understand that what's truly unique about Linux is the ecosystem
     and community around Linux, and they seem genuinely interested in
     building a symbiotic relationship that benefits both Novell and the
     larger community of which Novell is now part.

     Community-wise, the bigger our community and the bigger our
     friends, the more we as a community can accomplish.

   I also asked Ian about Red Hat's recent decision to discontinue Red
   Hat Linux, leaving Fedora:
   http://fedora.redhat.com/ in its place. He responded:

     This is another case of Red Hat leaving a void in the market, and
     voids equal opportunities. We're still assessing what opportunities
     might exist for Progeny as a result of this latest move. I can tell
     you that we've seen a lot of interest in Debian in the enterprise
     over the past few months, when people first started to see this
     coming, as well as a more flexible migration path from Red Hat 7.x
     than [what] Red Hat is offering.

   Ian also pointed to his blog, where he wrote:
   http://ianmurdock.com/archives/000068.html:

     The IT industry wants to break the chains of single-vendor reliance
     and proprietary lock-in, whether the lock-in is based on
     proprietary technology or some clever new scheme. But is the only
     way to break these chains to bring everything in-house?

     Actually, no. Progeny provides a third option: We're an outsource
     provider of Linux distribution maintenance that allows companies to
     essentially have their own Linux distributions, with a feature set,
     roadmap, and support model tailored to their needs rather than the
     vendor's, all without having to bring the distribution management
     function in-house.

     It's a non-intuitive business model for an OS company, at least at
     first, because we're so used to being at the whims of our vendors.
     We're so used to it that the same model has carried forward from
     the proprietary OS world to the Linux distribution world. Now that
     Red Hat is turning the screws on the thumbs that have been so
     carefully positioned over the last several years, people are
     starting to realize they moved to open-source operating systems
     precisely to get away from this kind of screw-turning.

   Unlike pontificating, we-solve-everything major vendors, however, Ian
   doesn't pretend to have all the answers--or even close to enough of
   them.

     And now, a Cluetrain:
     http://www.cluetrain.com-inspired question: Progeny's primary focus
     is on building distributions for what we like to call
     "Linux-powered products", products that are Linux-based but where
     Linux is just one layer of the overall stack, and possibly an
     invisible one at that. Lately, though, we've had a lot of folks ask
     if we might consider applying our customer rather than
     vendor-centric approach to Linux to the more general-purpose
     deployment/enterprise space. Could we provide support for
     enterprise Debian deployments? Could we keep the updates coming for
     Red Hat 7.x after they are end-of-lifed at the end of the year?

     So, market, would this be interesting to you? Talk to me, good, bad
     or indifferent.

   Frankly, I'm having a problem even caring about what Novell is up to.
   That's because I'm fed up with the Cult of the Vendor. And that's what
   this subject is all about, at least the level of attention we give to
   it.

   Linux isn't a vendor product. Never was, never will be. It's not even
   a product. It's a project by a development community that includes
   many vendors but isn't driven by any of them. Same goes for other
   members of the LAMP suite, with the single exception of MySQL, which
   owns the code (making it, in that sense, proprietary) but locates
   development squarely inside the community rather than in its own
   corporate container. In other words, they are very
   unvendor-like--market-compliant, I'd say.

   Development communities like Linux's grew out of the need to do what
   vendors couldn't do or wouldn't do. That doesn't make vendors bad or
   anything; it just puts them in perspective. They can't do everything,
   and now they don't have to.

   It's only natural for press guys like me to look at vendors as
   leaders. We've been doing that since the dawn of the Industrial
   Revolution. But there's another kind of revolution going on here, and
   it isn't happening on the supply side. It's happening on the demand
   side.

   Linux and open source are ways that the demand side supplies itself.
   Of course, in some cases the demand side also supplies--IBM, for
   example. But it helps to remember that IBM went gaga over Linux only
   after the OS was already widely adopted inside the company, by
   technologists who in some cases also were Linux developers. The
   company wisely got in alignment with the market reality it was
   experiencing at the cellular level. They did it first (for a big
   company, anyway), and they deserve kudos for that--but not for driving
   Linux. They help a lot; but it's not their project to drive.

   Perhaps Novell is going through the same kind of cell-change thing. My
   point here is that it doesn't matter as much as all the breathless
   headlines and analyses say it matters.

   Here's how Doug Kaye, the author, analyst and Web services guru, puts
   it:

     Fifteen years ago the vendors provided the vision. There was no
     other source. No "community" of users and certainly no Internet by
     which we could share ideas. The trade shows (Comdex, NCC) and the
     trade papers (Computerworld) were how we got our vision, and they
     were controlled by the vendors.

     High schools and colleges are now all about open source. It's LAMP
     everywhere. Open source is now also the new source for "vision" for
     IT managers and CIOs. How do you know what's real and not just
     vaporware? Go to the bookstore and look at the O'Reilly end cap
     display. There you'll see the LAMP titles: Linux, Apache, MySQL,
     and the Ps. These are the technologies from which one can quickly
     and inexpensively build industrial-strength applications.

   Bottom line: You're on your own, but you're not alone.

Did you have a good look at the capacitors on the motherboard while you

causing bizarre problems.

How does Knoppix run on it?

To totally reset the partition information, write zero's to the drive, 

dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512

that aught to do it.  Warning -- this will erase any and all data on the
drive.

More specific errors would be helpful with further ideas.

Well... FWIW, I've had exactly the opposite experience with it, in
general.

I haven't had any real problems with McAfee, PC-Cillin, or Grisoft's AVG
when it comes to AV software.  And I've worked on systems with all
three.  The closes to a problem I've had with McAfee was it not wanting
ot take a new license - that was fixed with (you guessed it) a reboot.

Norton, on the other hand, has given me nothing but problems over the
years.  System Works caused terrible instabilities back when I was
running Windoze as my OS of choice.  The AV software still plagues my
father's system (running XP) with constant problems, including not
wanting to patch itself.  The only remaining 98 system won't let me
install Norton on it at all right now, but other software installs
without any issues.

For a firewall, I would definitely go with ZoneAlarm - it's free, and
does the job just fine.  Just make sure if they have a small LAN, they
don't install it on the 'inside' computers - I don't know how many times
I've fixed networks 'not being able to talk to each other' by removing
the inside firewalls.

For AV Software - if they want cheap, Grisoft's AVG does the job quite
nicely, and is very very cheap (free).  

To the OP - I wonder, are y'all reselling Web-Ster, by any chance?  All
the farmers down here seem to use Web-Ster, re-sold to them in some
fashion or another.

(Deliberately top-posting because I want to)

This article is a 20/20 hindsight piece. This writer is
too selective about how he portrays events and people for
my liking. He blames Ray Noorda for Novell's woes and thinks
that his friends, the Burtons, would have done a better job.

Yes, Ray Noorda fired Craig and Judith Burton, but there were
good reasons. I'm unwilling to mention the details here because
this list is archived and I see no point in digging up old dirt.
Let's just say that Craig and Judith were responsible for their
own actions and Ray had little choice. 

Yes, Ray Noorda was responsible for the WordPerfect affair that
lost Novell a ton of money. But he was also responsible for
Novell having a level of ethics head and shoulders above other
companies. Ray coined the term "coopetition" and stressed that
cooperation between Novell and its competitors would result in
a much bigger market than if they were all greedy. This meant
open protocols and standards for interoperability that would
result in a positive user experience. Microsoft was/is the
antithesis of coopetition and compatibility. Ray felt that
Microsoft needed to be dealt with to protect the marketplace -
hence, the WordPerfect affair. I probably would have done the
same at the time.

Noorda was responsible for the acquisition of Unix. His plan
was to replace NetWare's proprietary core (kernel) with Unix, so
NetWare could be an application server where standard tools could
be used for development.

Noorda was the force behind Project Corsair that he started in
1993. This was an effort to create a Linux-based desktop that
would integrate with NetWare. Novell had working prototypes.
They had a web browser before Netscape released theirs. They had
a graphical desktop. Had this project been allowed to continue,
the WordPerfect suite would have been ported to Linux. Novell
could have had a complete Linux desktop by 1997, with a word
processor that people loved.

Novell would have then supplied Unix-based systems "from the
desktop to the server" in the 1990s.

Instead, Noorda was replaced by a CEO that wanted Novell to
get back to its core business - supporting NetWare servers and
Windows clients - a recipe for, at best, a lackluster business.
It's now 2003 and Novell is back to where Ray Noorda had them
nearly a decade earlier.

Very cool script, thanks for sharing. I'll using parts, at least for

  I've just looked on freshmeat.net and the only two CASE tools for database
design are a year or two since the last news on their home pages. I'm
looking for a tool that will allow me to set up a database schema by drawing
entities and relationships and then produce the sql that can be used by
PostgreSQL.

  Anyone have suggestions?

Hi Rich,

Have you considered using one of the persistence and O/R mapping
frameworks (my favorite is Hibernate, http://hibernate.org)? The
database schema, even the creation of tables is handled by the
framework. But you'll have to subscribe to their object logic. I use
Omondo, http://www.omondo.com/ these days to create the objects in UML
and XDoclet to generate the Hibernate mapping files. 

Otherwise there are a few Eclipse plug-ins for database tasks, you may
want to look at the Japanese Clay,
http://www.azzurri.jp/en/software/clay/

All above mentioned tools are free.

Dia is a very nice program that can do these sorts of diagrams. And
there are some programs/scripts that can generate postgres schema from
the diagrams. IIRC the one I looked it, however, didn't necessarily use
E-R as a source, but rather a mutilated UML.

Holger,

  Thank you very much! This looks perfect as I already have Eclipse here for
java coding. And, Poseidon for UML work. Both recommended by you and both
eminently suited to the tasks they undertake.

  We're using UML to model business, transportation security and
environmental impact assessment processes and Poseidon (version 2.1 just
released) dumps the results to code that Eclipse can use. Then it's a matter
of integrating this with the inference engines, rule-database and other
computational intelligence.

  I'll get Clay installed and set up a project today.

Chris,

  I could use 'tgif' to draw the diagrams, but I want to be able to
associate tuples with the relations and have sql code generated. Holger's
suggestion of Clay is an ideal solution because I'm already using Eclipse.

Thanks,

Two almost identical machines, and one works?  This makes the test pretty
easy, though it may still take a number of tests to narrow down the 
diagnosis.  This will take time, but your chances of success are good.

First, on the balky machine, try running Knoppix 3.3 straight off a CDROM.
This may not help you diagnose the particular failure, and Knoppix may
not run, but if it works it will give you the confidence to keep going.
If KNOPPIX doesn't work, well, you've learned something valuable.

If you can run the machines side by side, bring them both up into CMOS
mode (on some machines, hitting DEL during boot does this ... your startup
screen will tell you).  Look for differences.  Sometimes there is a feature
turned off - or on - and that can make a difference.

If you have your working Linux system set up to autodetect hardware, then
you can swap the different pieces into the working system one by one until
things quit.

You can also swap the hard drives between the machines.  If the working
drive doesn't work in the balky system, you've narrowed it down to hardware.

This should "just work" of course, and most of the time it does, but 
installing Linux is still only a 95% thing, and we need to do more work
with the corner cases.  I wish I had the time to help you debug, because
we could learn important things to improve Linux install for everyone
from it.

In any case, write down what you discover and put it up on a web page
somehere.  Even if - especially if! - it turns out to be "something 
dumb".  There are probably hundreds of people out there on the planet
with the same linux install problem right now, and if your discoveries
help them solve their problems you have done a Real Good Thing.  That
is what is so very cool about Linux, is that there are no laws against
us helping each other!

Message-ID: <20031106181519.GB7138@gate.kl-ic.com>

Fedora Core 1 is out.  This is the equivalent of RedHat 10.  I 
downloaded it last night, and I will try loading it onto two machines
today.  Note, it took hours to find an open FTP site, and that was
BEFORE the release was publically announced. 

I have the 6 images (3 binary 3 source), about 4GB, and although I
cannot serve them from my machine, I can probably get them uploaded
to an open FTP site if anyone here has blazing outbound bandwidth
and can tell me how to upload, and others how to download.

I plan to bring about 6-8 sets of Installs and Sources with me to the
meeting tonight.  I expect there will be a LOT of people wanting them,
so here's the deal - with the indulgence of the group, I would like
to dutch auction them, with the proceeds going to Linuxfund.  I hope
the price goes astronomical, and for those of you who can't afford
that, go in with a friend or three, locate a CDROM burner and make
more sets; then sell *those* to recoup your investment.  I may reserve
a set or two for schools or good download sites.

I'm jazzed.  Redhat/Fedora may not be your flavor of distro, but I
think "exponential distribution" like we will be doing will blow the
doors off the Microsoft retail linear distribution.  Let's see how
fast we can spread this sucker around the world!  Even if it is not
your favorite Debian/Slackware/Suse/Gentoo/other, demonstrating the
awesome power of sharing would be Really Cool!

I am assuming this is a rollout to many people.  A added box has a
number of new points of failure:

1)  The hardware (Chips, memory, etc.).
2)  The floppy.
3)  Its network card.
4)  The network card in the windows box.
5)  The cable (assuming a crossover).
6)  The power supply to the box.
7)  People believing that the "box" is broken.

1-6 are huge when everything is remote.  

7 is enormous.  People see this "other" box, and it does black magic,
and therefore it is the evil thing.  I am not exaggerating.  I had a
tech savvy client call me 6 or 7 times because the proxies I built were
down.  I would walk them through a process to only discover that the
proxies were clearly blocking only HTTP calls that were routed to the
database, the same database that went down repeatedly.  Each time I had
to explain how difficult it would be for the proxy to suddenly go down
for one type of call over the other when it did no content filtering. 
But each time they blamed the black box rather than run a simple test. 
I finally created an active web page to do monitoring, but that is
another story of human stupidity.

The main advantage of a box approach is with SSH you can log in and
monitor the connectivity and answer questions.

The real problem is the box only protects against direct port attacks
per se.  If you add squid it can filter adware, some malicious code.  If
you add A/V streams it will catch downloaded streams.

It will not catch malware that is not detected in streams.  It will not
protect IE from attacks (unless the filter is updated constantly).

It will not protect if these machines are portable.

Thank you for setting the record straight. Especially about the ethical
standards that Noorda stressed (although there were regular violations
of those standards, the ideal was very clearly stated). I was no fan if
IPX, but I did admire both Noorday, Novell, and Netware. It will be
interesting to see how Novell evolves with the Ximian and SuSE

Hrm.  The problem is that when a person has their line breaks set at 80 or
a little
over, most readers wrap the long lines so they fit on the screen, then,
quite
properly, obey the newline at the end of the just-wrapped line.  Just one
of those
corner-cases that occur in any software system.

And how would a mail-reader handle the above case intelligently?
Magically widen the screen or magically know which newlines to ignore?

Indeed.

I'm glad you found a good solution. I do think you misunderstand,
though. Dia is a Visio-type application. Files are saved in XML (IIRC),
not as images. Good luck with Eclipse!

  These can also be good things.

  We also have a problem with my wireless broadband business with a clueless
customers and old Win machines.  Our basic premise is that we *do not want*
to open the customers case or install software.  We're trying to avoid
playing the blame game over sudden failures on or around the installation
time.  The techs doing the installs carry hardware firewalls (and USB NIC's)
in their trucks.  

  The customer is notified when we schedule the installation to have a NIC
card and firewall installed.  If they fail to do that, we *highly* recommend
that the purchase a hardware firewall from us.  (At a tasty little markup.)
If the case needs to be opened, or software installed, we point them to
local PC service providers.  

  Our service agreement also includes a clause that strongly states that we
*will* disconnect their machine from the network if it becomes a problem.

One further recommendation I'd pass along is that they use Eudora or
Pegasus instead of Outlook. Just doing that has blocked 95-99% of all
viruses on my wife's Win 98 laptop.

(Once I'd say 100%, but somehow an infector virus managed to get into
her computer, & I had to spend a few hours cleaning it up. I'm still
amazed to find that one got onto her computer.)

It requires at least two things. Turn off HTML formatting, and use a

By the way, I'm at work and don't have access to my CD-R blanks, so if 
you want them bring me enough blanks to get the job done.

FWIW, just a warning, I have downloaded:
yarrow-i386-disc3.iso
from limestone.uoregon.edu two times now, and both times the MD5 does not
come out right.
Just wanted to throw that out in case it saves anyone some time.

So, are you wrapping your lines at 83+ columns here to demonstrate your point?  (Yes, I failed to rewrap them on purpose of demonstrating mine.)

Steven,

  In linux-speak you have /dev/hda and /dev/hdb. Were both recognized and
partitioned by the Red Hat installer? If you type 'df' you'll see the amount
of free space on every partition and it will show you the mount point for
each hard drive partition.

  Assuming that they're both partitioned and formatted for linux, all you
need to do is edit (as root) /etc/fstab. Unmount /u02 (as root, 'umount
/u02'), change the mount point of /u02 to a partition on /dev/hdb, then
remount it ('mount /u02').

  If you have a free partition on /dev/hdb, you can change its name in
/etc/fstab to "u03"). If not, then you'll need to run 'fdisk /dev/hdb' and
make some space -- and a mount point -- for it.

THIS is what the debate is about?? I've been using a GUI mail client for 
so long, I was thinking that long lines meant having to scroll 
sideways! Which is extremely annoying. But that's not the problem, is 
it. The problem is some lines getting broken up funny! Come ON! It all 
fits in one window, no matter how the window is sized- who CARES where 
they break?

I think this calls for a beer. Right now!

pine users, of course, know that Ctrl+J will wrap/justify paragraphs
according to the composer-wrap-column of their choice (mine being 70).

Practically speaking, only 2 and 7 are real problems.  4 need not be
considered, network cards are at least as sturdy as win-modems (and more
stable from my experience).  The floppy router will need to be running a
"real" modem, which will make for a much better connection and they seem
to run forever.  As for 5, network cables are at least as sturdy as
phone lines, subject only to physical damage.  Sure there is a chance
that other hardware will fail (you forgot the memory), but most of the
older stuff that is still around is very sturdy.

If you start with a fresh power supply and CPU fan (if it needs one),
then the average time to failure should be at least a couple of years.

So, it really comes down to the floppy as the main weakness.  This can
be solved by using a slightly newer box that will boot a CD-ROM
firewall, or by wrapping the floppy drive in a plastic bag.  It looks
tacky, but it does solve at least two of the most common problems.  Dirt
collecting on the media as it sits waiting for a power outage and people
ejecting the disk because they have been trained to think that a
computer shouldn't be booting the floppy disk.  Heat build up is not an
issue, because the floppy drive is run so rarely.

The beauty of these black box's is that they just work.  When the end
user gets used to this idea, they learn to start their trouble shooting
elsewhere.  I have a feeling (but no concrete evidence) that supporting
a herd of floppy routers (essentially configured the same) would be much
less expensive than supporting a herd of winblows machines directly
connected to the web, just from a man-hours required point of view.

Not if it can't dial out.  But, you can have the customer log in (this
could be over a null-modem) and follow instructions from tech support.

I will have to admit that this is true, but this is not part of the
firewall function, it is a function that MUST be run on winblows to make
up for the lack of careful design, independent of the firewalling
technique.  There is a difference between network intrusion and software
intrusion, the firewall should be responsible for stopping network
intrusion, and software on the local host should be responsible for
stopping software intrusion.  You can't get away from running software
intrusion stoppers on each winblows box.

This is also true, and short of running a reasonable OS on the portable,
I don't have a good answer to this one.

I know this will probably never fly, but it sure is fun to imagine an
ISP that will provide linux boxes as a firewall solution.

A deep bow to all for your speedy replies.  From the lack of consensus on the AV question, I'll optimistically assume that any decent product will do the job.  The Grisoft AVG hint was a bonus (wee like free).

By the way, this is not a rollout, just advice for existing customers.  Some of these machines are 486s running Win98 (my personal favorite) or possibly even 95, used for email and the Web.  Those infected may or may not be upgraded, I'm not sure.

I should look at more rigorous design practices but stick with the
rock-throwing design method.  Put something together, give it to the
users, and have them throw rocks at parts they don't like.  Well actually
I usually can't get them to sit down and _really_ analyze/describe what
they want done.  So I put something together that I think is right and 
they throw rocks at it - I fix the broken parts and we restart the cycle.  
The rocks do get smaller and fewer as we go along.

   So I can't say which of the above is good, bad, or ugly.

Hi Billy-

Did you check out any of those links posted for ya on the Salem LUG list?

I think that traffic shaping stuff is really going to be your best bet,
and the most powerful setup for you.

Squid will only be able to manage bandwidth per user for HTTP downloads
and stuff.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0311061743531.17610@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  When my Slackware machines boot -- using the frame buffer display --
there's a small image of Tux sitting in the upper, left corner of the
screen. Looks almost 3D and is a nice addition to the information scrolling
by.

  On the new laptop, the Emperor Linux folks replaced the simple,
distinguished Tux with a banner across the top of the entire screen that
screams, "I got mine @EmperorLinux.com". Ugly. And, if they want me to
advertise for them I need to be paid for the service.

  So, where is this image controlled? I'd like to replace the advertising
banner with the plain, ol' Tux sitting there having his feet scratched by
the information scrolling by beneath him. Is this something a mere mortal
like me can change without completely trashing the boot process? They do
have a custom kernel and I'm wondering if this banner is a binary built in
somewhere.

TIA,

Rich

I have copies of all the discs.  Bittorrent is a much better way to get
the discs.  (It checksums as the download progresses and does not slow
down as more people try to download it.)

AFAIK, that's in the kernel itself, and is all built-in.

If you take their .config (they did provide you one, right?)... you should
be able to just rebuild the kernel and get rid of that nasty thing.

However, if they patched other things in the kernel, as well, you're
probably going to be looking at needing to locate which patches they
applied and where.

Then again, there may be a boot-time switch you can pass to lilo (or grub,
I like grub myself) to tell the kernel to turn that nasty buggar off.

Are you booting with GRUB? Look for something like this in grub.conf:
splashimage=(hd0,0)/boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz

Then all you need is to find the image you want displayed, and edit GRUB 
accordingly.

It's built into the kernel.  The tux image data normally lives in
  include/linux/linux_logo.h
Since they changed the size, you may have to unpatch their kernel to
take it out.  Alternatively, you could get the fblogo program and create
your own linux_logo.h.  It would need to have the same dimensions as
their logo.  Another option would be to hack their logo file to something
simple, like a solid color.

It looks like the dimensions for the logo are in fbcon.c.

Rob,

  I came to that conclusion, too. When I searched my RH workstation for
'tux' one came up in the kernel/modules directory.

  Messing with their kernel is something I don't want to do. They've patched
it to work with all the built-in capabilities of each machine they support.
So I guess that I'll live with that. After all, it's not like everyone in
the world will be seeing it.

Many thanks,

  When I commented it out and rebooted all that splash screen does is
provide a background for the grub screen. The one to which I refer comes up
after the kernel to boot is selected and grub starts the init process in
motion.

Galen,

  That's too much low-level fussing for a novice like me. I'll live with it
as I live with Opera's ads in the corner (which I don't notice most of the
time).

  If it was something easy to do I'd change it, but it's not worth digging
into kernel code.

Many thanks,

Rich,

<lurk>

Talk to the supplier. You have commented previously that they have
provided you with a nice machine configured the way you wanted it. You
seemed pleased with their product at the time they supplied it.

Why not ask them for the easy way to remove their boot logo? You could
use a variety of excuses why it is inappropriate for their corporate
bootsplash to appear on your floptop.

If they care about their customers they will surely supply you with an
alternate image or instructions to remove theirs from your machine.

</lurk>
Just a suggestion

Message-ID: <20031107060628.2866.qmail@web9601.mail.yahoo.com>

I was thinking about getting another hard drive for
either internal or external use, so I wandered into
Circuit City. My eyes nearly popped when I saw a WD
160G drive, $90 after rebate. Oh, boy! What a steal!

So I open the box, and out slides this controller
card. Except for the lastest systems, they say, you
need to use this controller because the drive is
larger than 137G, Drivers are included for Windows, of
course.

Does Linux suffer from the same limitation? If so,
does it have its own drivers? If not, can the drive be
used without the card, merely sacrificing some of the
drive's capacity, which is gargantuan? At least, by my
standards? BTW, the PCI card is for 2.1-compliant
systems. My HP Pavilion 7950 is fairly new, so can I
be pretty confident that this requirement is met?

With hard drive capacity increasing continuously, I'm
sure that many potential upgraders would be interested
in the answers to these questions.

Oh, yes. If it doesn't seem suitable for installation
inside the computer, could it be used in a FireWire
enclosure without the controller?

Aren't they using BitTorrent?

If not, does somebody want to set up a BitTorrent server for them?

I don't use/like/even want to see RedHat's latest and greatest, even if
it isn't called RedHat anymore... but I don't have a problem with

This has come up on alt.os.linux.slackware quite a few times in the last
few weeks.  I'm pretty sure it just came down to needing to use a recent
kernel.  AFAIK, the controller you use shouldn't be an issue.

Hopefully somebody here knows for sure.  Since my biggest hard drive is
a 40GB drive (just got a second one, as a matter of fact, I don't know
what to do with all this space!  :-)... I didn't pay much attention to
the threads in AOLS.

If you're using Firewire, the controller is going to be in the
enclosure, I believe, so any controllers inside your system shouldn't
matter.

The 137G limit is an ATA/IDE limit. LBA24 (large block addressing) can't 
go any higher.  The controller card probably supplies LBA48, whether it 
works with Linux I guess you'll be finding out. But any limitations in 
the Linux kernel are probably up in the terabytes.
 
Oh, and that 137G is the usual inflated fakey gigabyte- 137 billion 
bytes. Which is about 128 "Real" gigabytes,  2^28 bytes, or 268,435,456 
sectors of 512 bytes. (I just happened to be looking at this my own 
self...)

Need more details on the chipset of the add-in card. I've used off-board 
HPT and CMD controllers in the past without much hassle. Just have to be
sure you get all the drive lettering straight ahead of time. :-) Early
on many of the chipsets either had no support in Linux or had serious
hardware bugs. These days everything is pretty much a non-issue.

(Side note: The only tricky bit these days is the pseudo-RAID ATA
controllers that are shipping more and more with popular mainboards.
Either don't use the board's RAID [Linux's md is usually faster anyways],
or be very careful about which drivers work in the kernel or don't.
Why is this an issue? These controllers aren't really RAID. They
facilitate the OS booting and then pretty much leave all the legwork to
Windows drivers.)

Thanks for all the help folks. 
Okie dokey. 
Problem solved. 
There is some kind of problem between the video card I was using and my
chipset and every linux usb driver that I tried. 
Switched the video card, had my finger over the power button in preparation
for the inevitable hang and the damn thing worked. 
What? How? No bloody clue. Tried the old video card again, nope, switched to
the other one, yup. Did this a couple of times while the "wtf" in my head
wore off. 
Put in a 7500 Radeon, that worked and then tried a GLINT 500TX card. I
figured a $7000 card should have drivers and it works great as plain vesa at
640x480, I have a bit of work to do, but hopefully I can get the glint
drivers installed without too many problems. Anyways. 

So hardware that conflicts. 
ECS K7s5a pro w/ SiS 735 chipset and 
Matrox MIL2P rev a 
512mb ram. 

Distros tried
Slackware 9.1
Knoppix 
RH shrike
Older knoppix
Gentoo 1.4 for athlon xp 
Whatever is used for the "acronis partition expert" software.

Now, whoever got the "google hacks" book at today's meeting can set me up to
have that come up first in the results when uhci is entered, that would be
cool ;) It was a really great meeting btw. 

Ram was a bit funky too. Memtest86 showed an area ~131mb that went bad the
exact same way ever 20 passes or so of test #5. Since I did have a 286 in
the wee old days where they actually cost over $2000, I suppose I was
overdue for a bad stick.

Other stuff
-----------

-Did you have a good look at the capacitors on the motherboard while you
were in there?  The things are still bulging out all over the place,
causing bizarre problems.
Yeah, they looked ok. No "gunk" near the tops either. I see this so often
too when working on boxes for people. 

-To totally reset the partition information, write zero's to the drive, 
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512

Ok, cool, did. Took bloody long (like 3 hours for a 60gb drive), putting a
task in the background in a console is just so damn cool though ;)

Does anyone know if this is a good choice for a 
linux WiFi card?  It comes with the pci adapter 
so if I get it I'll have at least part of what 
I need to play with wireless, although I guess 
nowadays there are finally some pci card choices 
that are good :-)

I'm wondering if it can take an external antenna.  
The PCI adapter alone is probably worth $15.



And I'm working on setting up a dial up server...

I was looking at a skutch telephone simulator that 
can do dailtone, but it costs $215.  For that kind 
of money, it makes more sense to get a second line.  

I have a skutch AS-4A, though I'm at a loss on how 
to connect a 95 box to a linux ppp server through it.  
Something about sending ATX0 to the modem on the 95 
box came up googling around, though I'm admittedly 
having a hard time finding complete instructions 
on how to hook the two modems together over this 
no dialtone line simulator.  The modem in my test
server is an internal 28.8 diamond legacy isa card 
and the other modem in the test client is an old 
IBM PS/1 system 2400 baud modem with friendly 
jumperless dip switch configuration.  I got close 
once to hooking them together getting the modem on 
the linux box to talk when I did something on the 
client box under hyper terminal...

I'm trying to get it working under Redhat 6.2 though
other options I have readily available are Slackware 
3.4, 3.5, and 8.  I have an isolated machine with a 
worn hard drive, though it is working 
well enough for experimenting as long as I don't 
partition where the bad sectors are.

The person that posted that forgot to add the count argument.
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1

Without the count argument, the dd command will write to the entire
disk, thus the 3 hours to complete.  With a count of one, dd will just
wipe the initial boot code and partition table, which should be
sufficient.

Flash memory is far too slow to be useful as swap storage. It's
better to spend your money adding fast memory to avoid swapping
or a hard disk to have fast swap storage.
Flash memory also has a finite (but large) number of writes before
it fails (you can no longer write to its storage).

It reminds me of the time I demoed a RAID5 array of USB flash
memory drives. It's cool that we can do it but ultimately not
practical.

fakey gigabytes - I love it. You could also call them "ordinary
people gigabytes" or "luser gigabytes" since it's based on the
normal base 10 system we're all taught in school, where
1 gigabyte = 1000 megabytes.

Instead of "real" gigabytes to describe situations, such as
memory, where 1 gigabyte = 1024 megabytes, we can call them
"computer geek" or "elite" gigabytes since ordinary people
don't normally think in these units.

Or we can use the more boring international system (SI) of units
where 1000 megabytes is called a gigabyte and 1024 megabytes
is called a Gibibyte, where the "bi" part stands for binary
or base 2. This system has been in place for years but has
never caught on. My publishers have always 86ed these terms
in my books, so the old system of confusing base 2 and base 10
units is assured a long life.

If your motherboard is recent enough, you don't need the new card, i
so try it first. If your motherboard IDE controller supports UDMA/100,
it'll almost certainly handle large disks, and if it supports UDMA/66
the odds are good it will too (these features are not related, they just
usually go together).

The card is most likely supported by Linux out of the box, it'll probably
be recognized by the same IDE module, if you have a recent 2.4 kernel.
I tried the cards which come with Maxtor and WD drives, they all work.

> Does Linux suffer from the same limitation? If so,
Linux supports large drives just fine. It does not even need the BIOS
support (of course it does need LBA48 from the controller, otherwise the
bus just does not have enoug bits to address the disk and it cannot be fixed
in software).

> Oh, yes. If it doesn't seem suitable for installation

It should work fine inside, I have a 250G disk in my PC and a 160G one,
no problem. But if you want to go external, you can get an enclosure
which converts IDE to USB2 or Firewire. They are about $60 at Fry's or you can
get them from the net for half of that (newegg sells USB enclosure for
$30 now). You need to make sure they have large disk support, most new ones
do but if you buy from ebay you should ask.
Now we get to really interesting stuff, whether that will work with your
Linux box.
I obviously haven't tried ALL distributions, but I know that stock Linux
kernel has a problem with USB-2 and if you try to copy several GB of data
onto external USB2 disk it'll lock up. RedHat patched their kernels, since at
least 2.4.18 they work just fine, I often write out over 150GB of stuff on
USB disk in one command.
I don't have a firewire disk, I do use Firewire-to-SCSI module (sbp2), and
it works for stuff like scanners, I just don't know how stable it is for
large disk (on the other hand, my scanner can send several GB of data when
it scans a roll of film, and I never had problems with it).

  How about drive sizes in exponential notation? For example, a 127x2^28

I wouldn't recommend it. Writing to flash isn't fast enough to justify
it and flash has a limit to the number of times it can be rewritten
(granted it's pretty high, but if you use it as swap on a small system,
you're going to hit it *much* faster).

That it would, very much so. To help answer the above question in the
context of this one, you *can* run Linux without a swap partition. This
is particularly done in these kinds of scenarios.

Have you tried bittorrent? It's working much faster than any ftp site

But you have to reply to them in order to get that functionality.

And you have to be the FIRST to reply to them since the lines were wrapped
badly, at that!

We're talking about courtesy to our readers, here, not just those who

Very cool-

When I run this to correct my own disc3 problem it says:
bash:
rsync://distro.ibiblio.org/fedora-linux-core/1/i386/iso/yarrow-i386-disc3.iso: No such file or directory

So I looked at the man file :0, and it looked like it could use a
destination file, so I appended one, same. I tried changing the site to
where I actually downloaded mine, same.

Is this the error you'd get if the site was at user capacity?

I currently use 2.4.18-14, fairly recent. And it's a

I currently have a FireWire enclosure, and have had no
trouble using the 20GB disk now in it with Linux. I
don't know whether it has large disk support. If it
doesn't, it might be worth the trouble to get one that
does. There are many ways to use large amounts of
storage which, fortunately, is getting cheaper all the
time.

Is there a comprehensive listing of supported hardware
anywhere? I imagine that not all labs for the
distributions test the same components.(I guess I
should contact HP first, but whether they'll respond
immediately or with the necessary information, I don't know.)

The problem is that every kernel version has a different set of
hardware support. That, and distributions often backport or import
from CVS newer hardware support into their kernels. So any
supported-hardware list would have to be keyed to every single
possible kernel -- a daunting task!

How do I enable underlined words in the console? When I read 
man pages in an xterm, certain words are underlined. But opening the 
same man page in a console, the underlines are not there. (for 
additional amusement, the underlined words are called "italic") 

I've read man terminfo and man ncurses and some others. Must be an 
answer somewhere. Or is this one of those hilarious insider oldtyme

Interesting. 

Is this a kind of "distributed ftp" project? it looks like the client is
bidirectional.

There isn't much on the site about the project.

That's pretty much exactly what it is, just it doesn't use FTP itself.

It's a distributed application that allows one master server to control
a bunch of clients, so you share and download whatever it is you're
working on getting.  The end result is a system that doesn't get clogged
up when a new release happens.  If 50-million folks all started
downloading something via BitTorrent, the only place you might run in to
a bottleneck would be at the controlling server.  There may even be a
way around that, I haven't looked in to it enough.

If 50 million folk start downloading something via BitTorrent, it has 50
million sources, too.

This is the way Pat decided to distribute the slackware 9.1 ISOs. 
BitTorrent was the only way to get them for a few days, until the
mirrors grabbed and put up ISOs themselves.  Bandwidth at slackware.com
has always been such an issue, I think it was the perfect solution.

Subject: [PLUG] Big Hard Drives (>137GB) on Linux
Message-ID: <20031107185700.GA17741@gate.kl-ic.com>

I use a number of large hard drives under Linux, with the 2.4.20 and
later kernels.  Here's the scoop:

The new LBA48 drives can sometimes be jumpered down to an 8GB drive
(uh, who cares?) but other than that you need an LBA48 driver card.
The good news is that Alan Cox has written drivers for these, and
these drivers are in the recent kernels (and in Fedora, Redhat 10,
and probably the most recent Suse distros).  The first drive will
probably show up in your system as /dev/hde .  The second drive on
that cable would be /dev/hdf, on the second connector on the card
/dev/hdg, etc.

Most of the boards that come with the drives are rebranded Promise
boards.  I have also seen HPT chipsets.  A.C. built drivers for both.

Them's the good news.  However, it gets weird if you get exotic. 
With one of my motherboards, *two* drives on these cards gets confused;
the motherboard doesn't quite figure out which drive to boot from.  On
another motherboard, boot works fine.  That is with any combination of
one or more large and zero or more "small" drives.  (120G is "small" :-) )

USB2:
You can also talk to these large drives with some of the USB2 interfaces.
I do this because I use the big drives for backup and want to hot swap
them.  A.C. has written IDE hotswap drivers that work with the regular
cards, but these have not found their way into the mainstream kernels
yet.  Probably by spring 2004.  So, more about USB2:

You take a speed hit.  The big drives are ATA-133 - that is a theoretical
raw 133MB/second, while the USB2 is theoretical raw 40MB/second.  I have
never seen either interface reaching those speeds.

I have a SanDisk InClose removable drive swap rack, driven off USB2 - 
this will talk LBA48.  However, the card appears to suffer from buffer
overrun or something, and when I move large quantities of data very fast
(like 1GB/minute for 5 minutes) it sometimes locks up.

Today I will be trying out some ViPower IDE to USB2 swap racks;  I want
to see if they suffer from the same overrun problem.  They have a different
chipset.  According to ViPower tech support, their cages work with the
large drives.

On external USB2 to IDE enclosures, the ADS LI5-USBX-804 enclosure will
not talk to LBA48 drives.  The GWC Technology UD-200 USB to IDE adapter
cable will not talk to larger drives, but by Q1 2004 the UD-200A will
(according to email from their tech support).    

There are a lot of other options out there.  I hope I have conveyed the
impression that most things work with large drives most of the time, but
expect a little hassle, mostly hardware problems and not Linux problems
per se.

Most of the LBA48 solutions are described as "up to 300GB", while LBA48
has a theoretical maximum of 144,115,188 GB;  however, I suspect that
by the time we get to those capacities we will be talking to the hard
drives very differently!  At full ATA133, such a drive would take more
than 30 years to write.  The 300GB limit is probably because the interface
makers don't have any larger drives to test with.

And yes, the new big drives ARE cool.  But consider how you are going to
back them up!

Carla,

  That's done with ANSI escape sequences. I do this for colored prompts on
both consoles and vts, but I don't know enough about them to know how to
invoke them with the 'man' command.

This is pretty simple, but have you compared your TERM variable?  I
believe this is where man decides which escape sequences to send to the
controlling tty.

Oh, but you'll never see this message, so fuck you.

Here, put this in your mail filter:
sed -e s/fuck/$@#!!/g

That might make your life easier.  I'm not kidding.

Oh, if only you could make headphones like that.

Seriously, it's just a word... and if the word isn't nice for you, then
remove it from your mail.  Takes two minutes and doesn't hurt anybody but
you.  But censoring me hurts me and everyone else that might want to see
what I actually write.

There's a reason alright.  Ignorance will get you everywhere you care to
be.

I have a FireWire enclosure, FWEIDE35, which uses the
Oxford Semiconductor OXFW911 chipset and is said to
support Ultra DM? ??de 5. It works fine with Linux
using the small hard drive now inside it.(Ultra DMA
Mode 5 is Ultra ATA/100, according to information
found elsewhere.) 

They should flat-out say whether it works with drives
larger than 137 GB, as some other manufacturers do.
FireWire enclosures cost about $100, a little more
than those for USB 2.0, but FireWire seems better
supported by Linux, at least at the present time.  

Does Ultra DMA Mode 5 mean that it supports LBA48? I
might prefer to go this route instead of the dealing
with the problems involved in installing it
internally.

My take on Novell/SuSE/Linux/IBM/etc... is every once in awhile
something happens that may alter the course of the Information
Technology industry.  I'm going out on a limb and saying I think this is
such an event.

The Linux kernel and distributions have come a long ways on the road of
maturity in the last couple of years.  Many of the behemoths in the
industry, except Microsoft, are betting big bucks on the technology.

At the same time, it looks like choices Microsoft seems to have made
early on about security and reliability are now coming home to roost.
During Microsoft's most recent conference call, Chief Financial Officer
John Connors said earnings are already being hampered by corporate
buyers who are holding back on purchases because of security fears. 

The Novell services stack is mature.  Running it on Linux offers
Corporate America a way to begin weaning themselves from Microsoft.
Starting with eDirectroy and then possible NetMail are big wins.  As the
Linux desktop matures, there may be more incentive for Corporate America
to get out from under Microsoft's thumb.

The confluence of these events is what I think is altering the course of
the Information Technology industry.

Fortunately, this time around trying to re-invent its self, Novell has
bought Linux and Open Source expertise and products.  It's up to Novell
to make it work.

But does it just put them under a different thumb?  And is that a good
thing?

I might argue that a lower price point (due to less monopolistic
aggression) is NOT a good thing... decreasing the monetary cost of being
oppressed does not decrease the oppression.

Novell is still a software company in the old-school sense.  They sell
bits.  I've always considered SuSE to be something of an interloper in the
world of Free Software.  Sure, they do pay some developers to work some
public stuff, but that's just the "smart business" angle.  They're still
getting way more out than their putting in, then using what they get out
for their private gain.  Their number one goal is not making a better
world for anyone but SuSE.

The situation begs the question of what it means for for-profit software
company to get involved in Free Software.

Will Novell continue to sell bits and, if so, can their commitment to
Free Software and the GPL can be trusted?

This can only be answered in the fullness of time, but unless there are
serious changes to the business model at Novell, I don't see this as a
particularly good thing.

The bigger the software company, the greater the damage when our system is
exploited.  IBM works alright because they are emphatically NOT a software
company.  They sell physical goods.  The software is becoming what it
originally was -- a value-add.

If you haven't figured this out already, you might want to take a look at
the settings in the system's app-defaults directory.  E.g., here are 3
relevant lines from /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm on my
system:

with bittorrent, everyone collaborates to distribute a large file
throughout the net.  the large file gets split into pieces, and
you ask a couple neighbors, "do you have piece X yet?" and in
turn you offer any pieces you already have to neighbors who want
it.  by requesting pieces in random order, the work of
distributing the file gets spread across the network, more
efficiently than simple mirroring.

  This weekend I want to copy all user files from my current workstation to

rsync before.

  Is the man page the only (or best) resource for learning the intricacies

I do know that for many tools, the man page is a great resource for syntax
and reminders of specifics when you know what you seek but it's a poor
resource for learning.

Can you tell me how to do that with Outlook (sarcastically)?  I'm not using
Linux on the machine I use to read email. Sorry. I get this email at work. I
have Linux boxes I work on at work, that's why I'm here (on this list).

Don't make assumptions.

Also, it wasn't the *word* that offended me so much as the attitude. I was
in the Navy for 10 years. *Words* don't bother me much at all. Least of all
the Anglo-Saxon expletive you've given.

And, seeing as you're spouting off all the time about making the world a
nice place to live, I am at a loss to explain how the attitude you displayed
furthers your argument.

Anyway, we've taken a 237.7 degree turn to OT, so I'm done.

That's a great tip, thanks- for Xterm. :) I'm trying to figure out how 
to make the underlines appear in a console- no X. Or italics, or 
however they are supposed to be displayed.

It's no great life-changing deal, just one of those funny little Linux 
things that's going to drive me nuts until I figure it out. As it says 
in man man:

"The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used 
as a  guide  in
       other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used 
together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable."

When reading a man page in an xterm, there are lots of underlined words 
(which may not show up in a mail reader), so they are rather important 
to understanding the man page.

Man pages are not so great as teaching tools, they're better for command 
references. http://transamrit.net/docs/rsync/ is a good quick n dirty 
rsync guide.

If you're just doing a one-time copy, scp is good. See the 'Copying over 
the network' section in http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/
library/l-knopx.html for the quick n dirty scp guide.

The man page is all that I used to get going with rsync.
Along with explanations of all of the multitudinous options,
it has plenty of examples.  Pretty useful, that.

The only assumption I made was that you knew how to control your own mail.
I guess I was wrong and I'm sorry... both that I assumed and that you
don't.

I'm not the guy to ask and this isn't the list for it, but surely there's
a mail filtering method in Windows.  Try google or USENET.

You said you didn't appreciate the language, not the attitude.  Perhaps if
you had written what you meant the first time we wouldn't have had this
problem.

It was a joke, actually.  I didn't bother with a smileything because I
didn't think I had to worry about the person to whom it was directed
getting offended and I CERTAINLY didn't expect anyone to whom it was not
directed to be offended.

> Anyway, we've taken a 237.7 degree turn to OT, so I'm done.

Sure.

Oh, and could you please trim your post of unnecessary quotations?

I suspect you'll need to look into fbcon. Although I can't offer any
more details than that.

As a side note, underlining was introduced in the era of typewriters as
a way of representing text that should otherwise be italicized, as
typesetting italics on a typewriter would be impractical. Strictly
speaking, anywhere you see underlining you should consider it to be
italicized. Of course, years of ignorant high school English teachers
have colored our own perceptions of this issue. ;-)

I've done full-system backups with rsync, and I just used the man page.  It's really not that complicated.  Just a smart copy program, essentially.

Without using some sort of display altering software, I believe you are
stuck with the characters that are represented by the 256 ASCII codes. 

I know in DOS, you can change the locale, and get different characters,
but your still limited to that, except where multi-byte characters come
into play. 

The catch to that is that when you change the locale, all the existing
characters on the screen change too. So, if you change to an italic
character page, all the capital 'A's become italicized capital A's.

I believe it's the same with the linux console.

Heh, they sell you the hardware, and license the software on the chips.
So you own the box, but none of the software.

As far as AIX goes, if you upgrade, you have to tell them what the
serial number of the machine you are upgrading is, because they keep
track. They also keep track of what add-ons you've purchased for the
machine.

Actually, only the first 7fh numbers are ASCII, starting
with 80h to ffh are the OEM extened ASCII, ANSI extened ASCII,

I've found the magic phrase (for me) is:

$ rsync -avP -e ssh user at source:/stuff /stuff

or to go the other way:

$ rsync -avP -e ssh /stuff user at destination:/stuff

-a is archive mode and does a lot of stuff, check the man page. -v is
verbose. -P is --partial and --progress, meaning it will won't delete
partially transmitted files if interrupted and it gives you a purty
progress bar. -e ssh uses ssh as the remote shell; good for obvious
reasons. This covers 95% of all my non-anonymous rsyncing needs. If
ou're feeling gunshy, use --dryrun to see what you _would_ do.

OT: Jeme's rude remark reminded me of a joke...

    An ill-mannered passenger cut his way past a long line at the ticket
    counter and demanded that the airline employee wait on him before the
    other passengers. The woman politely explained he would need to wait his
    turn like everyone else, and asked him to please return to the line. He
    blustered, "DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?!". The airline employee calmly picked
    up the PA mike and announced, "Ladies and gentlemen, we have a passenger
    who does not know who he is. If anyone can identify him, would you
    please step forward." The egotistical passenger blasphemed, "F at CK YOU!!"
    - to which the airline employee replied, "I'm sorry sir, you'll have to
    stand in line for that, too."

Message-ID: <1068255724.5166.35.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

It's model MAE3043LP.  On the sticker I have ID0 through ID4, must be
the scsi id's but shouldn't there be eight of these?  I also have
WRITE PROT, START CMD, SINGLE/WIDE, DIFFSENS, SP SYNC, IDD RESET,
LED, and TERM PWR EN.  I think the jumper block is on the front
of the drive though I'm wondering which jumper is jumper one.
Sticker says there's an led next to one side of the jumper block, 
there's something that looks like one.  If it lights up when 
I just hook the power up I'll be set.  I like to power a drive 
once before hooking it to any interface in case it smokes 
so that it can only destroy itself.  The drive is too cold 
right now to apply any power to it, it sure is taking a long 
time to come up to room temperature. 

I've never set up raid before, I'll have five of these jobbers
soon and an Adaptec 2940U2W to hook em up to.  Can you put five
drives on a high desity 68 pin scsi bus?  I've only seen a cable
for two.  Is there a special trick in the form of an adapter or
something to hook up devices that have the same interface as the 
Jazz 2 gig drives to this scsi card?  I have an Onstream SC50 to
hook up to it.  What would really be cool is an LVD scsi to LBA48
ATA/ATAPI6? tray for the 137gig drives that plugs into my scsi
card and can be removed hot.  I've got firewire on my Athlon, I'm
debating whether to build with my Athlon 800 or my Alpha PC164 366
mhz box.

Subject: [PLUG] rpm woes
Message-ID: <20031107175713.A29557@defiant.ncplus.net>

trying to summarize

I want to install quanta. It needs some qt lib that I don't have, and
haven't sorted out how to get. I decided to break down and install
apt-get so that it can sort out what I need to get quanta working.

apt installs, and I run apt-get update. It runs off and gets lotsa
stuff, and then informs me that I have two versions of rpm, and I need
to remove the old one in order for apt-get to work properly.

I run:

  rpm -qa > pkgsIgot
  sort < pkgsIgot > sortedPkgs
  grep rpm sortedPkgs > rpmPkgs

cat rpmPkgs:

  rpm2html-1.7-3.7x
  rpm-4.0.3-1.03
  rpm-4.0.4-7x
  rpm-build-4.0.4-7x
  rpmdb-redhat-7.2-0.20010924
  rpm-devel-4.0.4-7x
  rpmfind-1.7-4.7x
  rpmlint-0.32-4
  rpm-perl-4.0.4-7x
  rpm-python-4.0.3-1.03
  rpm-python-4.0.4-7x

I run rpm erase with typescript:

  Script started on Fri Nov  7 13:01:37 2003
  [root at auger whatHere]# rpm -e rpm-4.0.3-1.03.i386.rpm
  error: package rpm-4.0.3-1.03.i386.rpm is not installed
  [root at auger whatHere]# ^D
  Script done on Fri Nov  7 13:02:00 2003

Now, I'm confused. The query says it's there, but it can't be
uninstalled. I also ran "rpmdb --rebuilddb" (syntax?) to be sure that
the db was correct, and re-ran the above sequence, and got the same
results. How do I fix this confusion so that I can get on with my
original task (getting quanta installed)?

Thanx!

  Common error, Bruce. When installing a package the full _package_ name
needs to be provided on the command line. However, when erasing the package
only the _file_ name is to be provided on the command line.

  What you want is:

[root at auger whatHere]# rpm -e rpm-4.0.3-1.03

heh, mine is "rsync  -e ssh -azv --delete --stats /path/to/stuff/ 
user at remotesys:/path/to/stuff"

Though maybe I'll add the -P, looks good.
Things to watch out for is the difference between "directory/" & 
"directory".  The slash says contents of directory.

No, they're binary. ID0 = 1, ID1 = 2, ID2 = 4, etc. So if you want a
drive at 5, you'd jumper ID2 and ID0.

For a standard LVD setup you shouldn't need to set any of these, IIRC.

You can hook up 15 on LVD if you want. If you have heavy traffic, you'll
see a lot of bus contention, so beyond 5 or so isn't recommended per
channel. (And a 2940U2W only has one channel.)

SCSI cables are really expensive. Generally.

Yes, but you don't want to. Kinda like ATA33, putting an SE (single
ended) device like that onto an LVD channel will cause the entire
channel to come out of LVD mode. Which means your drives will negotiate
at 40MB/sec, not 80MB/sec.

Fortunately...

The 2940U2W has a multi-headed channel, so you can actually connect
single-ended devices on the 50-pin connector on the card. (I'm trying to
visualize the 2940U2W's I've seen, and I think it has one. Should have
an SE 68-pin connector, too.)

Connectors do exist. Search for Addonics. Typically, your overall cost
for a RAID will add up to be more expensive than just going and buying
a 3ware card, though. Plus 3ware makes hot swap ATA enclosures certified
for use with their cards.

BTW-Wanna buy my Jaz2 drive that's collecting dust? :)

The most fun you can have with this is go to a computer store like

That's worse than the time I pkzipped the entire system at Radio Shack,

Boot knoppix into fluxbox and that's proably enough right there to
confuse the hell out of 'em.  :-)

Or, better yet, try LNX-BBC and hackedbox.  :-)

Now that's a worthy prank. Much worthier than my habit of changing the

That was back in the days when the stores would use one of the display 
computers to transmit daily figures. I happened to be playing with that 
machine. :)

I would have loved to see the look on the face of the manager...

I used to just change the shell line in win.ini from progman.exe (or
later, explorer.exe) to calc or something similar.

  Ah, my kind of people! My faith in the quality of PLUGgers is restored.
Unfortunately, the pranks I, and my cousin, pulled when we were kids were
not computer related so they'd be off-topic for the list.

Way back in the '80s, when Commodore 64's were popular and sold at
Sears, I'd have some fun like this. I'd crank up the volume full blast,
then write a little program that would say "Please do NOT press any
keys." When someone pressed a key, it would flash the screen like
strobe light, and play a horrendous sound. It never took more than
about a minute for some schmuck to see it, look around, press a key,
then panic as the "alarm" went off!

Do you really want to live in a world where folks change each others computers

Naww, naww: In the Commodore 64 days you used to SAVE programs with a shoe-box 
cassette player/recorder:

Press 'Record' and 'Pause' on the tape player, cable up from the 1/8" audio 
jack on the back or side of the chassis, and into the tape player.

Then type SAVE with the cursor, release 'Pause,' and hit a carriage return.
(You'd load from tape using LOAD command plus 'Play.')

This could lead to two kinds of fun: (a) record programs over your older 
brother's Hendrix tapes, or pop one of said tapes into the player, LOAD it 
and see what 'All Along the Watchtower' looks like translated into BASIC.

Been running bittorrent since about 10am yesterday. The Iso's downloaded
before 10pm and I'm uploading my "torrent" at 10 k as we speak, over
platinum DSL. 

I'll consider using bittorent if you guys will let me know when cool
stuff is avail using it.

Oh- Must have been a thread I'd lost interest in. I'll try to read more,
maybe I'll even make a rule to flag "bittorrent"... Hmmm, the machines
doing the thinking, that could have possibilities.

Go here:

it even lists the commands for you to try (instead of btdownloadcurses you can use btdownloadgui or btdownloadheadless, they all take the same arguments).

I have never able to reach more than about 60KB/sec in the past on large 
BT downloads (and usually with a little poking I could find a mirror 
that I could download at 300KB/sec) - have they updated the clients 
recently?

I did that on purpose, that way the extra FAT at the end will be wiped
out too, making very sure that the old partitions cannot be recovered.

Have you tried limiting the upload speed when you're trying to just get
the stuff downloaded?

My connection, for whatever reason, totally bombs out whenever I'm
uploading anything.  I have 256/512 DSL, I think (they never told me
exactly what I have, but I'm able to hit ~60K down and ~30K up on good
days)... but whenever I'm uploading at, say 5K/sec, my download speeds
drop to near 5K/sec and latency skyrockets to the point SSH sessions are
useless.

I'm planning on checking out some traffic shaping abilities in Linux to
see if I can help reduce the effect uploading has on my connection, but
until then, I just can't share out anything that might lead to uploads
taking place...

When I downloaded the Slackware 9.0 ISOs, I was pulling 50KB/sec, which
is decent for my DSL connection.

I was allowing an upload of 1-3KB/sec, depending on the time of day.  I
don't think I was getting throttled too badly.  :-)

After the download finished, when nobody was using the Internet
(Midnight-6AM, I'd say), I let it go, full speed ahead, until my upload
count was twice the amount I had downloaded... to make me feel like less
of a leech. :-)

I think you can throttle back the upload speeds quite effectively
without risk of being throttled back yourself.

OK, for the last two weeks, I have diligently reported my spam to spamcop.net. 
I set up mutt so that I can de-spamassassin it, and forward it with two 
keystrokes. 

Then I've gone to their website, and processed the resulting reports. 

When I started this little process, I was dealing with 10 - 15 spams a day. 

Now, I've had over 50 a day for the past 4 days, and my mail server is now 
rejecting 60%+ of the attempted connections on an ongoing basis. I had a high 
of 87% last week. It seems my problem is getting worse, not better. I'm 
spending a couple of hours a day dealing with spam.

I have other things that I'd rather be doing. 

Is this typical?

  With regard to having other preferred things to do, yes. To have spam
increase, no.

  I filter very aggressively with postfix and average 6 or fewer spam per
day that come through. Some I report directly to the originating ISP, others
I report via spamcop.

  My reject proportion has gone from about 30% of incoming messages to about
60% of incoming messages over the past month or two. But, I don't believe
that has anything to do with how I report spam. It has a lot to do with a
few types of Microsoft virii that come in floods.

Many suggestions for using bittorrent.  It looks wonderful.  It would
be nice if the subject lines of the discussion included it, rather than
Fedora.  

If I were to use bittorrent, I would first have to:

    "rm /comcast/service/terms/no-servers" 

or risk getting my service cancelled.  I imagine bittorrent is not
quite as wonderful over 56K dialup, the other option out here in the
border lands.  I suppose I could first 

    "rm -rf /comcast/management/buttheads"

but that would probably require: 

    "cat megabucks | stock-market | tee boardseat | comcast -f clue "

or the highly illegal and rather messy:

    "cat /round/7.69mm | kalishnikov > /comcast/management/buttheads/skull"

Hence, I am stuck with downloads, and no bittorrent, sigh.

Message-ID: <1068333848.9855.74.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

David Weston and I finally got ours done.  We lost Jiah.  I hate to see
people fall out, but I suppose there are many reasons for it.  

I tried to talk to my ex's older sister, she was very friendly but the
friend wasn't.  I might have been dumped because of pressure from the
friend on my ex explaining her we shouldn't see each other attitude. 
Still, I'd take back comments about my friend's sister being rude even
though she is.  If I could do it over again, I wouldn't talk about PSU
at all either.  Then again, maybe crashing the party is a blessing, it's
wishful thinking to say I'd be happy if things had worked out.  I hope
if this is the explanation that my ex matures at some point.  One of the
things I love about her so much is how kind she was being only nineteen
years old.  With this friend of mine, his personality can be deceptively
friendly.  I think it's part of it is ego where the other part may be a
filtering mechanism.

Being a young newlywed with probably the first guest isn't easy either.
Perhaps it would have been a lot better if I had met the bride before
the wedding.  I guess I looked kinda needy especially with couples
smooching all over the place.  The wedding was the first time I got to
wear a new double breasted suit getting to try out a flashy red suit
shirt. This shirt kinda changes in the light from red to green.

My dad wanted me to march in a parade today, but the friend complaining
I don't deserve to, I didn't feel like it.  I'm near the bottom of my
family, not the middle or the top.  I'd say the top people are usually
red hots, the middle red hot wanna bes, and the bottom, at least in my
experience, are not well known at all.  For my friends the average age
seems to be fifty five.  Women who like my mother mostly.  I kinda got
set up with Lucy by a couple of mothers.  My dad tried to entice me to
march in my new tux with "some single gal you might like is back from
Iraq."  I agree with the organizations work, but to me right now Knights
is a married men's club where I'm neither married nor at all capable of
changing that at this time.  I'm not even certain I should shoot for
marriage, only the mothers seem to know ;-)  

Still, I've kinda grown up with the knights.  Maybe someday it will be a
lot more fun to be a knight.  Right now, it seems like wearing gold just
makes my dad go all over the place.  The Knights aren't well liked in a
lot of places even among Catholics, sometimes you just want to say I'm
Catholic and not mention Knights membership even though one of the major
points of the organization is to make that statement. It was set up to
protect widows and priests in the old days which it still does today
after nearly 100 years.  It's a large insurance organization, very
large.  The pomp and ceremony it has among male members is unique
though, we'll among the ones who participate in that anyways.  I imagine
it's nothing like San Diego anywhere in this State anymore except
perhaps remote places in eastern Oregon.

In some ways I'd say that the breakfasts and going to dinner is more fun
than ceremonial stuff.  Especially when a friend says you don't deserve
to be in the ceremony where sword, feathers, cape, and suit are worn... 
The costumes are really fancy.  It's as close to the look of a uniformed
military officer as one can get without being military.  One of the
requirements for gold is that my dad is a retired navy commander.  My
father says he's concerned about peoples' fears of the ceremonials of
the organization highly influenced by a time when the knights protected
Catholics physically where noone else would in this country.  That
function is gone in a physical sense, there's no swordsmanship anymore
and no defensive arts training, etc.  In some cases, the organization
has simply decided to abandon the swords at ceremonies.  You can't form
a nice arch without them, they really add something.  It's better to
leave the swords behind than it is to be kept out of the churches in
some cases.  Security for the D.C. event was so high there was no way
anyone could be armed in any manner, even for the sake of ceremony. 
It's not a real military organization.  I shudder to think what the
insurance runs for a group of armed men, especially where popular
culture shuns the group.

As far as the soldier gal back from Iraq, I don't deserve to date a
potential war hero!  I haven't been in this war or any other war for
that matter.

I haven't been following the recent Spamassassin discussions here but
let me mention I have been very happy with Spamassassin. After
downloading additional rules somewhere and adding a few of my own the
hit rate is very satisfactory. About one or two of each 100 spam mails
slip through. That's up to 4 on a hot day for me.

My problem with spamassassin when I last used it was too many false positives.
What's your experience there?

I have never able to reach more than about 60KB/sec in the past on large 
BT downloads (and usually with a little poking I could find a mirror 
that I could download at 300KB/sec) - have they updated the clients 
recently?

Subject: [PLUG] bittorrent (was Fedora Core 1)


Many suggestions for using bittorrent.  It looks wonderful.  It would
be nice if the subject lines of the discussion included it, rather than
Fedora.  

If I were to use bittorrent, I would first have to:

    "rm /comcast/service/terms/no-servers" 

or risk getting my service cancelled.  I imagine bittorrent is not
quite as wonderful over 56K dialup, the other option out here in the
border lands.  I suppose I could first 

    "rm -rf /comcast/management/buttheads"

but that would probably require: 

    "cat megabucks | stock-market | tee boardseat | comcast -f clue "

or the highly illegal and rather messy:

    "cat /round/7.69mm | kalishnikov > /comcast/management/buttheads/skull"

Hence, I am stuck with downloads, and no bittorrent, sigh.

I've heard lots of folks with this complaint (i.e., spam rising quite a
bit once they start reporting to a centralized authority).

My spam load has been pretty steady for about the last six months (before
which it did jump dramatically, all at once).  Certainly no change in the
past few days.

I would say I also get 50 or 60 spam messages per day.  I reject no mail
at connection time and I would say unsolicited commercial/scam mail
accounts for about 30-50% of my daily message count.

I use spamassassin and it catches all but maybe one message every other
day and is yet to catch a message that I wanted to read.

Personally, I think all that business of blocking and reporting is a waste
of time and energy and just makes the problem worse, but you know that.

Almost none. Mails with score between 5 and 8 are moved into a special
folder to check. It contains app. 5% of all spam. I find a false
positive less than once a month. Everything with a score of over 8 I
never look at. I send out a response telling about a keyword that can be
put into the header to get around the filter. Nobody did this so far. Of
course spammers don't even receive it. 

I almost exclusively receive spam mail on one account that I used as
administrative contact for domain registration. That seems to be
harvested heavily. My private address is only used for direct
correspondence. When I post to newsgroup I use an address that I change
every other month. After an address becomes invalid sendmail will return
an error message that tells about the current one. Again, spammers only
care if it worked on the first shot. 

Lastly, I use dedicated email addresses for eBay and alike. It is just
interesting to see how they are handed around. If the spam level
increases for a given account I change the address with my subscription.
With these dedicated accounts I wouldn't even need SpamAssassin.

I suspect it works like the soups my father used to cook. No recipe and
when one was especially tasty he couldn't tell what he put in.

Oh, spamassassin gets 'em. It's just I'm reporting them all the same. 

I also have a folder that I put false negatives in, and the sa-learn routine 
goes through weekly. 

Maybe I should just trash the ones that spamassassin properly flags.

I don't recall.

If I did, it was a LONG time ago and I hadn't given the situation serious
thought.

I can see how a person might think that on first blush, but any real
consideration of the mechanics and circumstances immediately reveals that
anti-spam action outside the recipients' mail system counteracts the
network's ability to make us more free, individually and collectively.

I certainly wouldn't EVER condone reporting to a self-appointed authority
like spamcop.net which uses bullying to shut down other people's
connections on other people's networks.  Very ugly.

I set my required_hits *below* the default 5.0 score and still get no
false positives. I can't say enough good things about spamassassin.

After having downloaded the CDs all I can find is the GPL agreement in
the COPYING file. It is true, not all on their distribution is GPL'd.
But you'd think they would put a fat warning on their images if they are
not supposed to be copied. I couldn't find it. It could be that the
downloaded ISOs have this cut out, but that is highly unlikely. 

I also don't find anything about this elsewhere (i.e. SuSE's website). 

Who at SuSE told you about this? 

Thanks!

I too ran into the bad MD5SUM problem, so I gave this a try, and it
didn't work.  Actualy, the result I get suggests rsync is trying to
connect to ftp?

   ftp: Unknown host
   rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes read so far)
   rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at
io.c(151)

I even tried a copy/paste to insure it wasn't a typo, same result.  Can
anyone tll me what I'm doing wrong?

Also, While I'm at it, What's with the odd name of the third source
disk? ".yarrow-SRPMS-disc3.iso.V6a8nR" (As it appears on limestone)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0311090718340.20149@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I added a second hard drive to my new system and now need to prepare it
for use. I know that the first step is 'cfdisk /dev/hdc' (it's the master on
the second IDE bus with the cdrom as the slave on the primary ide bus) to
partition the drive and designate mount points. The second step is to make
the file system, which is reiserfs on this machine.

  However, I cannot find the appropriate 'mkfs' syntax. The man page is from
1995 and does not include reiserfs. Using apropos I find references only to
minix and sco in addition to ext2.

  I'd greatly appreciate a pointer to a reference that will tell me just how
to format this drive using the reiserfs.

Thanks,

  I guess I need more coffee this morning. 'apropos resiserfs' returned
three tools, the first of which is mkreiserfs.

OK, I guess you found it.  I was going to suggest;

	This looks like a good starting point  --

	http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/tutorials/2926/1/

If the reiserfs utilities are available (see below) 'mkreiserfs /dev/hdc1' should create 
the fs, and options are applied with mount.

>From page 5 of same:
"Once the new kernel is built and tested, you can use the mkreiserfs utility to format 
partitions as Reiserfs filesystems. As with the regular mke2fs command, this will erase 
all the data on the partition! (By the way, after you build the kernel you have to go into 
a subdirectory of the kernel source and separately build the Reiserfs utilities, which 
include the mkreiserfs command. Instructions for doing this are found on the Reiserfs web 
site.) Once the desired Reiserfs partitions are formatted, you can use the mount command 
(with -t reiserfs options) to mount them just as you would with regular ext2 partitions. 
You can even put Reiserfs filesystems in the /etc/fstab file to have them mount 
automatically during system initialization."

Thanks, Carla. 

Seems I'm ok with my copies. 

I wonder whether it was a pleasure to the SuSE people to answer your
questions or they felt pressured to answer ;) Well, they were nice about

Now, it also looks like my doom and gloom is not quite as bad as I thought. 
You can reproduce and distribute SuSE linux CDs. You just can't make any 
money off of them, if they include the YaST program.

English as second language.  I deal with a company in Germany and though
my main contacts speak and write English better than I do, others there
don't and I get some rather interesting messages.

   Probably they 'the SuSE people' were trying to say they are 'happy' to
say.  Reminds me of High School spanish.  If memory servers me correct a
literal translation from Spanish for 'joking/humor' is 'to make one drink
hair'.

I seem to remember that the client wanted 16 bit color or something 
equally silly.  Is there a debug mode for the client?  Do you have access 
to someone who can look at the server logs to see what it shows on their 
end when you try and log in?

Sorry about that.  I had intended to say 'probably forgot'.  I didn't
mean to sound so definitive.  That's pretty painful, though, to have

Subject: [PLUG] SuSE 9.0
Message-ID: <20031109223037.33fc4336.russell-evans@qwest.net>

I had a chance to play with SuSE 9.0 this weekend and thought I would
post what I have found so far.

Wine on 9.0 will install MS Office97 Pro and will run all but outlook,
access, excel, word.  MS Office2000 Pro didn't make it through the first
screen.

My monitor was blurry using 8.2 with the nvidia drivers. 9.0 is
noticeable better. Whether this is nvidia driver updates or X I don't
know, but it really is better. I used to have to work with the monitor
to get X to line up correctly, 9.0, no issues straight out of the
install. 

Wireless setup is much better. In 8.2 if you had a card that was
identified via wlanX the network scripts would not work with it. Network
scripts in 9.0 work reasonably well. RH 9.0 has the ability to sense
media, and will complain that there isn't link on the ethX. SuSE has yet
to implement something like that and it is a draw back to wireless on a
laptop with a built in Ethernet port. Only one of the interfaces will
setup routing when both are set to use DHCP.  SuSE determines which one
gets to setup routes by the alphabet sorting of the interfaces, ethX
wlanX in my case. There is a setting that allows the manual setting of
which interface should be primary, but is quicker for me to add a route
than edit a file.  I have been working on adding a media check to the
scripts as I did in 8.2 to work around this. I had it working in 8.2 but
forgot to save the file I munged before upgrading. The really nice
addition to wireless is the hostap drivers, and bridging tools are now
included. This makes it very easy to build a wireless ap out of an old
box. I've been building an ap from an old box with SuSE since 8.1 and
have had to go get the tools, do the setup and kludge everything
together. Now it is pretty simple. Vtun and OpenVpn are there to make it
easy to secure as well. The 2.6 IPSec setup looks pretty good too, but I
old read up on it, haven't tried it out.

There is more system management configurations in yast now and a few
server management tools beside cups. It all pretty easy. If you are a
KDE person yast is not embedded in the kde control center. It looks
pretty slick. There is also this new tool that looks a lot like the
hardware tool in windows. I can't remember it is is a kde tool or SuSE
specific tool. The other MS window-ish thing is a vnc setup dialog in
yast for remote help. 

I have some issue with the yast runlevel editor, on two boxes after
doing the updates and turning off what I don't need, the yast run level
editor modules hangs when loading a 28%. SuSE 9.0 have a lot less
services runing than 8.2. The most notable to me was that atd is now off
by default. 

Firewall setup is easier than ever. The more detailed firewall setup is
available under yast in the /etc/sysconfig editor or by editing the very
well commented configuration file. 

DVD writing tools are there for dvd+rw drives. I bought a dvd-+rw at
fry's for $129 a couple of weeks ago and the dvd+rw tools are usable to
make a dvd-r/rw on that dvd writer. k3b seems to be the default GUI tool
in SuSE 9.0 and it uses dvd+rw tools to write dvd-r/w media so probably
it makes no difference if the drive is strictly dvd-r/w. 

I have been using opera for a web browser for a while because I like the
interface. The google entry box, tabs, the ability to strip down the
gui to make it compact, the small size really works for me on my
laptop. You do have to buy the thing to get rid of the big, at 1024x768,
ad box to make it really nice and compact.. I would place opera as
something I would not want to give up because it works so well for me.
That said, SuSE 9.0 ships with MozillaFirebird and I'm using it only. It
has got all that I like about opera and none of the stuff I don't;
paying for each time they make the xx.x to xx.y jump, and the really
annoying I found the address you are typing in the history file and now
I'm not going to let you type anymore, so get busy and grab the mouse,
issue. It took about an hour to get to the point where I said OK, I like
it. It took another hour installing extensions to make the tabs be more
opera like, and getting the very important extension that lets you use
external programs.  

Which brings me to mail clients. I have been using pronto for a while
and I think it really rocks. It is another program that I don't want to
do without. The problem with pronto is that it is a perl gui and is
pretty memory intensive. 

So SuSE 9.0 comes with Sylpheed-Claws. When I was looking for an email
client, Sylpheed was in the range but it had some things that didn't
work at the time, I think it was filtering, that made me choose pronto.
I think the spell checker was also one of the things that
wasn't there, Sylpheed-Claws has pretty good filtering and the spell
checker beats the spell checker in pronto very easily. The only thing I
wish I could figure out is how to map control-d so that when its keyed
over the folder list it deletes the mail in the folder instead of
deleting the folder itself, a la pronto.  SuSE already has the update
for the security issue in Sylpheed-claws that came out this week.

SuSe 8.2 did come mplayer and xine. SuSE 9.0 only has xine. I think the
picture quality is better with mplayer and that is the only reason I
care. There is a new KDE video player out, so that might be the reason
SuSE dropped mplayer. It not like I wouldn't compile it anyway. 8.2
introduced firewire hotplugging that worked, SuSE 9.0 continues to have
better and better hotplug support. 

I'm sure there is more groovy stuff that I have missed. KDE or
Gnome users probably will note many more things than I because of my
choice of window manager. The install is easier than
before and it was pretty much cake since 7.3. The other really handy
thing is the installer can shrink or grow ntfs partitions.  Very nice as
most vendors are shipping MS on ntfs now. 

Thank you
Russell

That was supposed to say it can run word, excel, access, but not

Message-ID: <1068447120.3283.13.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Googling a bit I run into something called slapper and
another worm called lion.  I don't get how Lion supposedly
does this, but reportedly it can take the system passwords 
and send them to China.

I run apache as a non root user, the only thing
that would be better would be to run it chroot.

What I don't get is how someone can do damage through
your web server.  Web servers aren't supposed
to be able to cause side affects on the machine they
are running on.  How are people getting web servers
on remote sites to run arbitrary code?

What's this bind vulnerability that slapper supposedly
takes advantage of?  How many worms affect Linux systems?
How about virii and trojans?  Installing chroot is a pain,
but anymore it seems like the only way to protect against
software flaws.

Well, I've known for a long time that C has some very poor
functions as far as no bounds checking goes.  I guess what
I don't get is why the system can't do bounds control and
catch an overflow attempt of any program running on it.
I thought in a Unix environment that users were kept
successfully within their own memory space.  One trick would
be to give prorgams enough room to overflow some in order 
to catch the problem.  I have a hard time following assembly 
code.  I guess the major point is that if you don't check data 
someone gives you it can be arbitrarily well conceived code 
that when it overflows some buffer it loads into it'll execute.  
In high level languages such as C++, overflow comes up and can 
be dealt with by good programming.  J Nix's course wasn't very 
good on this topic, this is one reason why I didn't go on 
to the Beowolf clustering section.

When you overflow a buffer don't you usually overwrite it 
from the beginning or top, rollover so to speak?  If an 
odometer rolls up to all nines it will flip to all 
zeroes, this is one form of overflow.

One thing I don't get, why does the stack grow down on
IA-32 from a fixed address?  This seems horrendously
limiting.  I never did get why it's supposedly better
to be on the stack than in RAM on an IA-32 machine 
since the stack isn't on the processor unless it's 
in cache memory.  Is it faster to access RAM from 
address zero on a PC than from other locations?

How many programs have been stack overflow audited
in Linux distributions?  Is there a way to run a 
virtual machine to audit for stack overflow?  Don't 
know how much that can help, if you overflow your 
virtual machine's memory space you'll probably 
still have your host system affected.  Seems the 
only answer is a compiler that actively breaks bad 
code before it executes, seems like it would be 
tricky to write one that smart.  Coming up with 
an executable analyzer that can catch binaries 
with stack overflow problems is something that 
might be doable.  If a stack overflow or seg 
fault happens, how does the exploit still manage 
to execute?  If only the OS could catch that 
an instuction will overflow soon enough to 
prevent the damage that can do.

What's the largest bug-free program you've written?

The source code to Apache 2.0.48 is about 20 megabytes, which is
4 times the size of the complete works of Shakespeare.  How long
is it going to take you to read 4 Shakespeares and make sure
there are no plot holes or inconsistencies?

(1 Shakespeare is also approximately 1 KJV Bible.)

It depends on how affectively I use modularization, functional
abstract, in some languages classes.  It helps to program 
piecewise.  This is where a statement of what code does 
can be nicer than the looking at the code itself.  Where 
such a statement is concise, accurate, and covers what's 
needed to depend on that code safely it can be satisfactory
to skip direct code inspection.

I'd rather document programming and systems than write
software.

I think some of my data structures stuff got up to four to five
pages, maybe 1000-1500 lines of code.

What version of Wine?
Did you test anything on Access?
Was there any special setup on Access?

I ask this because all the info on the Wine web site seems to indicate that
Access and similar programs won't run, so I had scrapped the idea of moving
a
VB program that I wrote over to Linux in favor of re-writing it.

Getting it to run under Wine would make some things easier.

Any pointers anyone?

  I tried to pull the Fedora ISO's off "limestone.uoregon.edu" several times
over the weekend.  It looks like their Disk 3 Binary image was no good.  It
didn't have the correct MD5 sum and didn't pass the installation disk
checker.  

  I'm FTP'ed into limestone now.  They're re-syncing the ISO directory
again.  It should be back up and working with correct images in a few hours.

This is great stuff.  Have been using it like crazy just the last few
days.  Am continuously amazed at the great tools that I didn't know about
but how useful they are.

Anyway, can someone please clarify-
1) Can SCP (which I use all the time) do the same/similar to rsync via ssh
example above?  I presume the advantage of rsync would be that rsync is
smart about only copying the changes?
2) How does this vary from the dd utility?  When would it be better to use
dd?
3) Have been thinking about a tape backup, but would it instead be a bad
idea to just rsync the important directories from each host, to every
other host in some sort of mesh (with one target hosts offsite)?  Then
occasionally save the really important stuff on a CDR in case of flood?

Thanks!

Steve, et al.:

  Sometimes the obvious is invisible and I seek the more complex solution. I
changed /etc/grub.conf so the kernel command line video option is now
'vga=normal' and there's no banner because frame buffers are not being used.
D'oh!

Yes.  The larger the file, the bigger the advantage of rsync.

The dd program is a dumb block copier.  Read the paper on rsync for an

Rsync and related backup methods are a good idea.  Stay tuned for an
"advanced topics" presentation of the topic in December.  I'd just say
here that for many people CDR is wholly inadequate for this purpose
just on a capacity basis.

Strictly speaking, you don't need that stuff, though it certainly can

Of course, hard drive backups seem pretty safe and fairly sturdy and the
cost per gibibyte (heh) is insanely low.  I didn't like hard disk backups
before because of the constant spin and the lack of inexpensive hotswap,
but the external enclosures mean you only need to power up the drive when
you're doing the backup/restore.

Oooh, perhaps one could put a firewire enclosure in a UPS that is serially
controlled (USB or otherwise) so you could actually power up the enclosure
and do the save/restore all automatically.

Neat.

Well there are two other options:

1)  Use a serial controlled switch.  There are ($$$) switches for server
rooms that can be controlled remotely. T urning a UPS on and off may not
be a smart thing to do.  I am not sure they are built to take many
cycles. Sides, will a UPS turn off right away, or will it drain?  I
wonder....

2)  Some USB, and therefore it should be that some Firewire, devices get
power off the pins.  That is the main difference between 4 and 6 pins. 
I do not know of any firewire enclosures that do this, but I have heard
of USB hard drives that will power off the port.  Given the ability to
shut off that power, you have what you need.

3)  Making a relay that runs off the com switch or parallel port is
pretty strait forwards.  Run the power through the relay, and switch off
the com port will get you there as well.

4)  You can do this all with X10 for about $40 (get the right sale, and
it should be less).  Most of the computer controllers have 1 switched
outlet on them (almost always Port 1).  Hook a serial line up, grab any
of the X10 programs, and walla!

UPS's typically lose battery power even if "off" and unplugged - I've seen
this with all my APC UPS's from the peasant commercial ones to the behemoth
Smart UPS 1400 and some of the crappier ones I've had. I'm not sure exactly
what causes the drain, but the battery discharges relatively quickly.

You can turn an ups off, (i.e. no voltage to devices but it stays fully
charged) - I don't want to be overly generic but my smart ups 700 and 1400
have serial ports that I have tested this with, and I'm sure that this is a
common feature by sending a command to it via serial. Newer models use USB,
so you get a bit of extra fun with those. 
Heh, I can drive up to Canada with my 1400 quietly humming away in the back
powering my tower. /geek.
I'd post specs, but different UPS's have different commands and the such.  

Actually, I might have a bunch of X10 devices if anyone is interested (like
10 or so, including the serial controller) Never tried them under Linux. I'd
have to find them. 

Good luck.

3)  Making a relay that runs off the com switch or parallel port is
pretty strait forwards.  Run the power through the relay, and switch off
the com port will get you there as well.

4)  You can do this all with X10 for about $40 (get the right sale, and
it should be less).  Most of the computer controllers have 1 switched
outlet on them (almost always Port 1).  Hook a serial line up, grab any
of the X10 programs, and walla!

Speaking of UPS, here is another question: Yesterday I ripped the tired
(lead-) batteries out of a UPS and hooked it up to an auto battery I had
laying around. That battery was charged and a test with the computer
running from the UPS for a while was successful. Did any of you test
this setup over a longer period? Does the average UPS charge this large
of battery properly? 

Thanks!

I am continuing with another aspect of using Linux
with large drives and offboard controllers. RH8 and
Mandrake 9 are two distros known ot work with such
controllers.

As at least one member of this list reported, hda and
hdb can appear as hde and hdf when the drives are
attached to the offboard controller. So I suppose that
if the Linux installation is cloned from a smaller
drive, fstab should be modified to reflect the
anticipated changes, prior to grabbing the
screwdriver. Any other potential problems?

The possible use of a removable "rescue" system to fix
such problems intrigues me. I downloaded Linuxcare's
Bootable Toolbox and have experimented with it, but
are there other recommendations for such purposes?

I'm not an EE where my older brother could give a better answer
if he were on the list now.  I've heard that concrete kills
lead acid batteries.  I don't know why though.  Evidently, any
battery sitting on a shelf slowly discharges.  Keeping a 
battery cold such as in a refrigerator is good, I'm guessing
this slows some chemical reaction that is causing the battery
to lose it's charge.  Heat being a catalyst for that reaction, 
refrigeration helps slow it.  Something builds up in lead
acid batteries over time, but there's a treatment using
some acid like boric or something that can bring these
batteries back to life.  I'm not a chemist though, so ask
a real one if you want to know.  Chemistry seems a whole 
lot more practical than kinematics for programmers.  Why
do programmers have to take physics to get a B.S. from
so many schools around the area?

I guess the big thing with charging is to maintain the
proper voltage where I've heard that slow charging is
better than quick charging.  My guess is that heat 
catalyses a reaction in batteries making them 
discharge faster than they otherwise would.

Make sure the proper gauge wire for the input and output of the
battery is connected to it and that the proper resistors are used
as well I guess.  An Ohm meter is a good idea for checking
the phase of the power off the UPS.  Don't plug the battery into
AC.  Wish I knew more about this, but I'm not an EE.
I guess transformers are used to control voltages off of a
power source, but you lose power I think with every transformer 
so fewer are better.  Don't must good ups units discharge one
battery while charging another one?

The size of the battery should match the charging unit in the UPS.  If
the battery pulls more amps then the unit is rated for, it will burn up
over time.  Of course finding what the real rating is (vs. what the
company will tell you) can be tricky.  Googling is good.

But on to more pressing matters.

HOLY SHIT.  WHY THE FUCK DID YOU ANSWER THIS?

Not only is most of the information just wrong, damn near every other
line says you do not think *you* do not not know what you are talking
about.

Why are you talking then?

Just because someones asks a question, does not mean *you* need to
answer it.  If you don't have a clue, don't prove it to us.  Really we
already know.  Go flame Jeme for some unrelated post...

First off if you want to know about batteries, look at
www.homepower.org.  The best information about batteries is found at the
various alternative energy/living/vehicle sites (Electric cars, wind
power, solar power, dome living).

For the record I am an Electrical Engineer....

> I'm not an EE where my older brother could give a better answer

It depends on how fast the battery approaches the concrete...

WHAT THE FUCK?  What does that have to with anything Stephen asked
about.  Not only is nonsensical, it is completely irrelevant.  Now if
you were mention God in there, then it would be normal, for you, still
nonsensical and irrelevant, but normal, for you.

>   Evidently, any
> battery sitting on a shelf slowly discharges.

This is one of the few correct things in here.  Batteries are stored
chemical power.  The potential energy will find a way to get released. 
Some batteries do this quicker than others.  Car batteries tend to be
slower.

>   Keeping a 
> battery cold such as in a refrigerator is good,

Nope.  This is a myth, and wrong.  There is a slight charge gain back
for taking near dead household batteries and putting then in the fridge,
but it is short lived.  Putting fresh batteries in the fridge actually
shortens their lifespan.

Batteries have energy equal to the chemical reaction in them, anyone
with an Electric Car will tell you their range is shorter on a cold
day.  There is less Chemical Potential Energy.  While you do not want
the batteries to boil, the more warm/ambient the better, within a range.

The plates get covered.  There are a number of treatments, which many
people swear by, and others swear are frauds.  Time is a pretty good
friend here.  Just let the battery sit for 40 years.

Again, why post?

Do you ever read your own posts and say "WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT GUY
MEAN?"  Most of us do.

>

> better than quick charging.

Wrong again.  Proper charging involves a fair amount of interactions
between voltage difference, frequencies, fluid conditions, etc.  There
is a curve that is optimal that is pretty damn fast for many batteries. 
Ask an Electric Car owner.

Don't guess.  Go read on the subject instead.

Don't guess.  While sufficient gauge wires might be important (Stephen
mentioned he replaced an existing battery), there should be no resistors
unless you are trying to change the voltage, or create heat for no
apparent reason.  Given your post, I suppose that is likely.

>   An Ohm meter is a good idea for checking
> the phase of the power off the UPS.

Um, you spelled "Ohm" right, ever thought to look up what it means?  It
is a measure of resistance.  It has nothing to do with Phase.  To get
Phase, if you wanted it, you need an oscilloscope, or one of the cool
Fluke meters, or some other time-based measuring device.

>   Don't plug the battery into
> AC.  

Why not?  You have been guessing all along.  It might be fun.  Of course
hammering the poor little double-A's into the wall socket might wake the
neighbors, but someone has to call 911.

> Wish I knew more about this, but I'm not an EE.

If you truly wish to know more about this, then go research it instead
of giving wrong information.

I was trying to see if I merely re-arraigned the words if I could make
that sentence correct.  I can't.

Transformers change voltage levels (eg 110V to 9V), they do not control
them (Same transformer might make 100V into 8V).  You lose power with
any component, but transformers do not significantly do this.  With the
right kind of motor, and an understanding of Capacitance and Inductance,
you can gain power back.

This is almost accurate.  2 or more batteries gives you redundancy in
terms of batteries.  If the batteries are always supplying the voltage,
you get a more consistent (but not necessarily smoother) waveform.  A
smart config might charge one battery while the other produces, but it
turns out that has issues as well.

Really, Michael, stop posting so much.  Just because you *can* answer,

Exccuse me Zot.  He wants to know about whether or not a battery
situation is good.  Curiousity about what needs to be known
is not a bad thing and not irrelevant to post even if I get 
corrected entirely.  The question about why take physics instead of
chemistry is a good one because it is an option I have where it would
seem that knowing some chemistry would help more with understanding 
batteries than the physics.  Especially taking into account that
kinematics seemingly has nothing to do with electronics.

I'm disappointed so many show such a complex about physics, a lot of
peers tell me their tired of the political bullshit that surrounds
taking it as a requirement.  This is why you should say your a physicist
when taking physics, it's one of the few good lies a CS major needs to
say in their career.  The concept of lying about being more knowledge
than you are by never saying anything wrong is dangerous though.

I got him some information in a round about way.  By putting the wrong
information out, unintentionally, I hopefully got you to say the right
thing.  How is this not good for Stephen.  If answering others annoys
you that much, maybe suggesting good sites instead of the standard go
google would be good.  Face it, if anyone could know what you do by
doing a little googling your profession ceases to exist.  Searching with
a search engine is not that precise, it takes special skills, sometimes
you have to know something going in.  Geez, sounds like part of the
definition of a profession to me.

Another thing, it is not normal for me to mention God on this list. 
Your not very observant.  When I have mentioned God it was because
someone else took his name in vain, etc.  There was a reason.  Just
because Godwin's law is popular doesn't make it gospel for everyone.  
I wouldn't teach Godwin's law unless I was an agnostic, but even 
then it might be too much because there's God in it ;-)  
  
The last time I had God or anything close to God in a message I really
did screw up and I even said, I miss posted.  It's obvious I did as it
was clearly a conversation with someone off list.  I haven't made the
points I was after from the times I've mentioned God, though holy means
different so I don't know why holy shit is considered such an insult. 
I'd almost argue it's a compliment, I've been accused of coming up with
something new where the shit part is just your opinion.

You don't like me obviously, so what.  With your political views
clouding your judgement, I'd say your a product of a cold and sarcastic
culture exhibiting language filled with colorful metaphors as part of an
acerbic manner that should make you look dumb.  If you didn't say
intelligent things frequently enough to balance the stinky attitude, I'd
say you are dumb.  Who in their right mind wants to work with a guy like
you the minute they find someone equally smart or smarter who is also
decent?  I'm not going to hide because I'm ignorant and say, "oh the
world is upset because I'm ignorant."  Nor am I going to be pressured
into being an acerbic jerk, saluting the Feuhrer, elevating agnosticism
above sectarian views, denouncing constitutional freedom of religion,
denouncing constitutional freedom of speech, denouncing every person's
right to live ...  it would be un American.

Bad manners isn't a religious issue, it simply shows a lack of
professionalism.  I should have never reenrolled on this list and I've
been trying so hard to stay out of trouble but I have to say I question
if it's worth trying or if I should just move on.

Is there a formatting solution using printf to get commas every three

The source disk 3 was also bad - hopefully they are fixing both.

I'd never seen that cool branching before. Neat. Just goes to show
what someone who knows sed well can do. I had to assign a variable and
write a loop:

  x=9123456789123456789

  while [ $(expr "$x" : '[0-9]*') -gt 3 ]; do
    x=$(echo "$x" | sed 's!\([0-9]\)\([0-9]\{3\}\)\(\.\|,\|$\)!\1,\2\3!')
  done

And I should've used either the word boundary marker or a negated
class ([^0-9]) instead of my "dot, comma, or end-of-string" thingee.

Live and learn.

Ask any auto-mechanic or battery manufacturer. A battery sitting on a
concrete, or dirt floor will discharge. To properly store a battery,
place it on a piece of wood. I've stored batteries for months this way,
and that's what the battery rep I used to buy from told me. 

> Keeping a battery cold such as in a refrigerator is good,

In storage, I'm not so sure. I do know that a cold battery loses it's
ability to deliver amps. 

Ever wonder why most batteries fail in the fall? That's when the
tempurature drops. There are two things working against you at that
point. The battery isn't able to produce as much "push" (amps) and the
engine requires more, since it's colder.

Are you talking about sulfates, or corrosion? Sulfates occur when a
battery is idle for long periods of time. You see this most frequently
on Motorcycles and ATVs. Any equipment that sits idle. The battery
manufactures also sell lots of motorcycle/atv batteries in the spring.
There are "treatments" you can purchase for this, but they are mostly
stop gap measures that just prolong the problem. 

Corrosion is that white stuff you see. It's mostly a nuisance. Easily
cleaned up with a little baking soda.

However, a battery doesn't "pull". A battery "pushes" amps, and you can
in turn, "push" amps back in by overcoming it's electrical potential. 
If that's wrong, then my instructor at LCC lied to me. :)

And, as any mechanic can tell you, storing a lead-acid battery on
concrete will cause it to discharge. A fully charged battery can be dead
in less than a week stored on concrete.

A quick google search shows that this is no longer true.  Here's 
an example.

http://www.interstatebatteries.com/www_2001/content/faqs/tech_talk/maintenance/storing.htm

Will storing my battery on concrete drain the charge? No. Regarding
today's batteries, this is a myth. A battery placed on concrete will not
discharge any faster, but a battery will discharge over a period of time
wherever it is placed. If the battery has a surface layer of acid or
grime which is conductive, the battery will self-discharge more rapidly
than if it were clean and dry.

This myth does have some historical basis. Many years ago, wooden
battery cases encased a glass jar with the battery in it. Any moisture
on the floor could cause the wood to swell and possibly fracture the
glass, causing it to leak. Later came the introduction of the "hard
rubber" cases, which were somewhat porous. A current could be conducted
through this container, which had a high carbon content, if the moist
concrete floor permitted the current to find an electrical ground. The
wise advise of the old days to "not store batteries on concrete" has
apparently been passed down to us today, but it no longer applies.

I would not believe somebody just because they are a "mechanic". There is no way to know what their qualifications are. Just about anybody cat get a job in a garage changing oil. Would you consider this person to be an expert on batteries? 

There are a lot of unscientific "beliefs" floating around that people continue to regurgitate because they heard it from somebody else. Some of these are based in fact, some are not. This particular bit of wisdom once had a basis in fact, but is no longer relevant. A very quick google revealed the following three links. 


>From www.batteryfaq.org/carfaq14.htm#concrete

14.1. Storing a battery on a concrete floor will discharge them.

All lead-acid batteries will naturally self discharge. The rate of self discharge is most influenced by the temperature of the battery's electrolyte and the chemistry of the plates. Some experts believe that storing car or deep cycle batteries on a colder concrete floor might actually slow down the leakage rate because the floor acts as a heat sink. (Please see Section 13.)

In the early 1900s, when battery cases were made of porous materials such as tar-lined wood boxes, storing batteries on concrete floor would accelerate their natural self discharge. Modern battery cases are made of polypropylene or hard rubber. These cases are sealed better, so external leakage-causing discharge is no longer a problem, provided the top of the battery is clean and free from wet or dried electrolyte and the same temperature as the floor.

Large differences in temperature could cause electrolyte stratification within very large batteries which could accelerate it's internal "leakage" or self discharge if the battery is sitting on an extremely cold concrete, stone or steel floor in a warm room, boat or submarine. Stirrers or bubblers are used on these types of batteries to keep the electrolyte from stratifying.

>From http://www.powerstream.com/Storage.htm

Continental Battery: 
Q: Will a battery rapidly self discharge if placed on concrete? 
A: No, placing a battery on concrete will not cause it to discharge any faster than any other surface.

>From http://www.pacificpowerbatteries.com/aboutbatts/Deep%20Cycle%20Battery%20FAQ/dcfaq10.html

10.1. Storing a battery on a concrete floor will discharge them. 

A hundred years ago when battery cases were made of porous materials, such as wood, storing batteries on concrete floors would accelerate their discharge. Modern battery cases, made of polypropylene or hard rubber, which are better sealed, so external leakage, causing discharge, is no longer a problem. However, the top of the battery must be clean and dry. Temperature stratification within large batteries could accelerate the internal "leakage" or self-discharge if the battery is sitting on a cold floor in a warm room or is installed in a submarine.

>From http://www.becksgunsmithing.com/exide.htm

Will placing my battery on concrete drain the charge?
A battery will not lose its state-of-charge strictly from placing it on a concrete surface, but will discharge it over a period of time, due simply to neglect.

This used to be true when the battery cases would allow a small leakage
current if stored on a moist floor.  Refer to any of the Links off this
Google search:

If you're interested in the chemistry behind a lead-acid battery, try this
link:

http://science.howstuffworks.com/battery3.htm

If you want even more info, the reaction itself is fairly advanced high
school chemistry.  I bet you can find it or one much like it in the
electrochemistry chapter of any good high school or college freshman
chemistry text.  A bit of study will show you why some batteries have
different voltages than others.  (I.e. lead-acid vs. alkaline vs. NiCd vs.
NiMH, etc.)

Try not to get too discouraged by folks jumping down your throat on this
list.  It takes a pretty thick skin to stay here.  Since you have not been
actively adversarial, it's safe to say they're just differences of
opinion and/or misunderstandings.

One of the many reasons that the old "appeal to authority" is not a valid
argument.

If you can't be told WHY a thing is true, don't believe it regardless of
the experience and perceived wisdom of the preacher.

Sometimes elders are just dumb old people.

Not only would I not consider them an expert on batteries, I would not
consider them a mechanic. 

As with anything, there is a certain amount of qualification. In my
post, a "mechanic" has proven to your satisfaction that they indeed have
the qualifications. 

In other words, you are the judge of the information. Take it for what
you will. 

As Zot pointed out, he's an EE. As I'm pointing out now, I've been
through the two year auto-mechanics course at LCC, and I was ACE
certified for auto-parts when I worked for NAPA. If I hadn't found my
true love (computers) I'd probably be slinging wrenches somewhere.

And, actually, I've witnessed just such a discharge of a fully charged
and operational battery. Two weeks and the battery was dead. I don't
believe the battery would have been dead, if it had been (A) in a car,
or (B) on a chunk of wood. It was sitting on the concrete floor of a
garage when it was removed from a working car (mine) just before I
pulled the engine to rebuild it. The battery was less than 6 months old,
so I know as well as I can that it was in good condition. This was in
the 1980's, well after the quotes you've pointed out claim this problem
to be resolved.

True if (1) there are drives on the onboard controller and (2) the kernel

Don't do that 'til you've seen which device the drive comes up as.

Yeah, the distro install CD.  When you boot from it, the first thing that
comes up is a menu or commandline that lets you boot in Rescue mode.  The
distro's rescue mode an sometimes do a nicer job of finding and mounting
the filesystems.  Red Hat's Rescue mode ain't bad, it lets you chroot to
your normal environment and do what you gotta, such as edit lilo.conf and
run lilo.  Oh, and make sure you have a spare rescue CD, whatever it us.

So where you gonna put the boot sector?

Good luck,

Message-ID: <20031111202211.GA10415@gate.kl-ic.com>

Concrete floors or not, the question was whether car batteries work
on UPSs.  I tried it, with a Topaz charger/discharger meant for car
batteries, using some brand new marine deep-cycle batteries. They were
continuously being trickle-charged in a room temperature room.  They
were sitting on a few sheets of corrogated cardboard (in case they
leaked) in the unused fireplace in my office (in case they vented
anything lighter than air, like H2). 

I had 4 batteries in parallel - I had earlier tried some experiments
with a UPS that used 48V, so I had the batteries.  The lower impedance
of 4 batteries made no difference to the UPS;  all good UPSes limit
current during charge and discharge, so it does not matter if the
battery looks like 12V with 0.1 ohms in series, or 12V with 0.00001
ohms.  Of course, it does matter if something shorts out in the UPS,
which is why I was no longer experimenting with the 48V UPS, it would
have died regardless of the battery feeding its failure, but the failure
was "more spectacular" with 4 marine batteries than 4 gel cells.

I was careless;  I forgot to monitor the fluid level and the batteries
dried up.  Refilling with distilled water and appropriate battery acids 
did not help - they apparently sulfated or something.  I had to
recycle the batteries about a year after I bought them.   

My "take home" lesson is that batteries need maintenance, and that
lead-acid open batteries need more maintenance than UPS batteries.
My UPSes are now running on standard sealed UPS batteries, which I
assume are designed to last a lot longer in this kind of application.
They kick in about once a month when the power glitches, as it does
in the fall out here in the 'burbs.  Horny squirrels romancing the
insulators on the transformers - BANG,  Rocky the Frying Squirrel - 
out goes a branch line, and the circuit breakers flip to alternates.
But I digress.

If I had to store a LOT of power for UPSes, for example a data center
with a lot of computers that needed to stay up until the emergency
generator started, then lead-acid batteries with a monthly maintenance
check would probably be just the thing;  I would rather pay the tape
monkey to check cheap batteries instead of buying more-expensive
batteries. But for home and small business use, a good UPS that uses
sealed long-life batteries might be more convenient and less expensive
for careless people like me.

And you believe this based on an empirical test with a control battery of
identical make, condition and wear setting in the same conditions except
for a wooden block for support?

No, you base that belief on the belief that it's true.  Totally circular.

Your have some small amount of experience that leads you to believe
something that's unscientific and wrong.  Such is life.  The entire human
common-sense model of the mechanical universe is completely wrong (what
with invisible forces with no known mediating particle and so on).  Your
perceptions are not reliable enough to support beliefs.  Instead, your
beliefs should be founded on the bedrock of the underlying principles of
the system.

As someone here used to write all the time, the plural of "anecdote" is
not "data".

Subject: [PLUG] Shockwave flash on Fedora C1?
Message-ID: <33516.207.173.0.68.1068585965.squirrel@webmail.woo-hoo.com>

I just got Fedora Core 1 installed on this machine, and have only Mozilla
and Epiphany configured as my web browsers.
Mozilla reports itself at 1.4.1
Need to install shockwave flash.  Find my way to here:
http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash&P5_Language=English

Run through it, as both root or regular user.  No errors, do all that it
requires, but Mozilla never shows flash available as a plugin.  This
worked just fine with RH9.

Anyone have experience with getting shockwave flash on FC1?  Or ideas why
it wouldn't work?

Thanks!

You could check at their Web site. Initially a new
distribution is only available for download to members
of their club. I've heard that 9.2 isn't safe for
certain types of hardware, so you might check this
out.

Hello, All:

I'm trying to gauge the interest-level in Linux
training as it concerns people that we support. 
Specifically, how many of you believe you or your
business would be willing to send employees to a
facility for Linux training if benefits such as
reduced TCO, higher productivity, greater product
awareness/confidence and skill were delivered?

What I'm attempting to do is muster support for
developing a Linux training component for our company.
 If you believe you could "help", I'd really
appreciate the support.  A simple positive email to
this effect would be greatly appreciated.  

Thank you,

CJ Lohrenz

I think one way to decrease TCO is to remove the recreational perks known
as training conferences from the system requirements sheet.

browser admin interface. winduhs users get more management utilities, 
though you still don't get shell access.

The major concern I have is antenna placement. If I use a PCI wireless 
card in an old desktop machine, with the antenna poking out the back, 
will I have a poorer signal? How much does antenna placement matter

Message-ID: <r02000200-1031-0E191BF814A811D8BF22000A959F4BC6@[172.27.1.100]>

The environment and opportunity for making Novell/SuSE a success
couldn?t be better.  

Today?s Novell/SuSE marketing model seems to be along the lines of the
new Red Hat model, but less severe.  Red Hat?s decision to drop the end
users, hackers (the white-hat version), businesses and educational
institutions means these communities are looking for a new home.

Red Hat Linux supported products were readily available free as CDROM
ISO images over the Internet.  Linux communities relied on access
to these images for the latest and greatest Red Hat distributions.  They
learned Red Hat particular quirks and helped develop Linux skills and
experience in the marketplace and within organizations.

Test-driving Novell/SuSE Linux today is difficult at best.  CDROM ISO
images are not available.  The only ways are to download more than 6GB
of files or install directly from an FTP server.  Both methods are
impediments to using Novell/SuSE.  Postings to Novell/SuSE mailing
lists and news groups by disenfranchised Red Hat users are reflecting
this frustration.

Changing the Novell/SuSE marketing model and accommodating the needs
of Linux communities cut off by Red Hat, will go a long ways in
promoting the wide acceptance and use of Novell/SuSE.  Making free
limited-license versions of Nterprise Linux Services available over the
Internet will spur interest, knowledge, and skills using the Novell/SuSE
Linux product stack, for existing Novell customers and for future Novell
Certified Linux Engineers.

The Linux world is most likely ready to embrace Novell/SuSE.  Making
test-driving the product stack as smooth as possible will go along way
in making Novell/SuSE successful.

Depends on the house.  In mine for instance, my bathroom walls block
signals very effectively.  And I think I just thought of why.  Instead of
clay tile, they used coated metal plates on the walls.  I'm not sure if
that's the actual reason, but since I get the worst signal between the two
rooms on each side of the bathroom, it's a workable theory.

Thanks to you and the others for the advise. The implications of the 
lower impedance during charging is why I was asking my question really. 
You say a good UPS should limit the current, but you still used the 
Topaz for loading. Why?

My UPS with the dead batteries turned up in a dumpster dive and together 
with the battery (that I stored savely on the concrete floor) I thought 
I have myself a zero cost UPS. The whole setup, if it should work, will 
eventually be stored under the house in the crawlspace (that's also my 
glorified "server room").

BTW, this car battery is sealed and can't be refilled. I think most car 
batteries come that way these days.

Antenna placement matters quite a bit depending on which antenna you
are using. You can run a cable (or make a waveguide) but you will have
some (too much?) signal loss. Basically your average PCI card is
probably going to suck when it comes to power output. 
Google "host AP" or "software AP" for more stuff on the software side
of things. 

Here's a bit about antennas, basically gives you a very basic idea of
what antenna does what. 
http://www.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/PoyntingAntennas

If you have a couple bucks, you might consider getting a soekris box
(kind of like a mini pc, a nice enclosure, has slots for pcmcia
wireless cards, etc.) 
Folks have debian running on them and usually nocat. 
http://www.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/NoCatAuthFaq has a bit of info,
also see what I copied below. You have quite a bit of power in
controlling access, etc. 

Or. . . 
Get a Linksys WRT54G AP, Rob Flickenger and friends in Seattle have
found that it has full iptables support, bridging, etc. Tres cool. No
nocat yet, but hopefully soon. Sounds like what you are looking for. 
http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3525

As I said before the average PCI card is low power, and it seems that
pcmcia Senao 200mw cards are the most popular card right now. 


-------------Keegan Quinn [ice at thebasement.org]
I've made some Debian packages of NoCatAuth.  They're based on the
latest nightly snapshot and include the stable-01.patch.  There are
two packages: nocatauth-gateway and nocatauth-authserv, for the
gateway daemon and authentication server, respectively.

The packages are available at the following APT source:

deb http://rune.thebasement.org/~ice/debian keegan main 
deb-src http://rune.thebasement.org/~ice/debian keegan main

I'd be glad to hear any kind of feedback about them.  I hope to get
these into the main Debian pool in time for the next stable release.
If there are any Debian developers out there: please send me a
message, I could really use a sponsor.
Thanks,
 - Keegan

  Antenna placement and signal loss/gain are critical in any wireless
systems.  The WiFi PCI card (IMHO) have gotten a bad rap on their signal
coverage.  The cards I've seen come with cheap 0 Db omni-directional
antennas.  They're designed to be installed in back of a metal chassis and
pushed up against a wall.  This a pretty much a "worse case" installation,
guaranteed to provide poor signal coverage.  

  A remote directional "patch" antenna will give you some gain and help push
the signal in the right direction.  You'll have to choose an antenna to
match the flavor of WiFi you use.  The antennas are tuned to an operating
frequency.  2.4GHz for 802.11b, 5.2GHz for 802.11a, or Dual-Band if you'll
be using both.  RF cable loss can also a killer.  Keep your cables as short
as possible.  

This looks like an unusually good WLAN article: 
http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/Sections-article47-page1.php

Here are some antenna links to ponder:
http://www.pacwireless.com/html/apxtender.html
http://www.hyperlinktech.com/web/antennas.html
http://www.skycross.com/wirelessdataantennas.asp

  I'm working on a MythTV box for my home right now.  It will eventually
hook into my home network using an dual-band 802.11b/a PCI card.  I'll
probably hook up a desktop mounted, +5Db directional patch to get the
antenna out from behind the TV/DVD/VCR and pick up a little gain.

Is this for your house / home office out there in the rural place
you've moved to?  If so the poorer signal could easily be plenty 
good enough.

This message was typed on my notebook in the living room connected to 
the net through an AP that is exactly what you describe.  An old desktop
with a PCI wireless card. The AP is in the basement and I manage to get
coverage everywhere I need it in the house.  

As others have noted it will be the presence of metal that will be
most detrimental to the signal.  Aluminum siding will severly degrade
your backyard connectivity.

Funny you should ask. Of course home is my test lab, but I'll be doing 
installations in interesting places, like barns and tractor sheds. And 
small businesses, which are often steel buildings with wood/drywall 
interiors. Maybe that will add security, by trapping signals inside? :)

Thanks everyone for great information.

  Tractors will probably bounce the signal rather unpredictably. Be sure to
test the cows and sheep, too. They may block the signal by absorbing it. It
would be rather clever of you to come up with a way for a cow to signal to
the farmer in his house that she's ready to calve or that he's late for the
milking. You may need one of them thar fancy Microsoft keyboards for the
cows to use.

Something I didn't see mentioned was concrete.  It seems six inches of
concrete might as well be two feet of lead when you're dealing with
WiFi.

I helped a friend network a barn re-finished into an office for a small
company (~10 employees, I think).  Due to the nature of the building, we
decided a WiFi/10/100 hybrid setup would be best.  It turned out to be
accurate, but geeze, what a lot of work... and we went over budget.

The walls in this office were thin, like a half-inch of wood thing, with
some cement walls (it was a dairy barn) between some rooms, going up
about four feet.  We didn't think much of it at the time.  All the
computers were down low, either on the ground or a foot or two above the
ground.  As such, the LOS between many of the computers and the WAP had
a concrete wall in it.

We ended up wiring in more offices than we had originally planned.

Then came the fun stuff - running WiFi into an office in the attic 30'
away from the doorway to the attic.  We thought about wiring it, but the
area was such a high-traffic area and the floor was such we couldn't. 
The rafters went up too high to be easily reachable, too.

We ended up buying a 'pigtail' antenna, I think it was called, for that
office, since the WiFi signal was incapable of penetrating an inch of
wood and three of fiberglass insulation.

Overall, WiFi's signal degredation was far more than we had anticipated,
and it ended up eating *a lot* of my time and a decent chunk of various
folks' money.

Then compare that to home... I regularly take my laptop all over the
house, using my WAP as a base-station.  It sits on one wall of the
house.  Five feet away, I get a 85-90% signal strength.  If I go into
the 'family room' it drops down to about 65-70%.  The signal, then, has
to travel through two interior insulated walls, a mirror, and a
shower... and it drops that 15% or so.

If I take it up into the bonus room over the garage, it drops down to
only about 30%, where it goes through two exterior walls.

I guess the moral of these stories is... buy some equipment you can use
around the house, and before committing to providing a networking
solution for somebody in an odd situation, take *your* equipment out
there and make sure you're going to be able to get the signal where you
need to get it.

Have fun.  :-)

Why not replace the bell with something that can send a WiFi signal?
There might be better choices for a tracking device though.
If they were bulls they'd need bells in the event their horns don't
work ;-)

Any water resistant sheetrock tends to reflect / weaken the signal.
Tin foil will do a surprisingly good job of blocking signal.

You also want to have any large metal items (tractors, steel I beams
and the such) at least 1 wavelength away from the antenna. A couple
inches should be fine. 
With tractors, etc, 

You can also experiment, plug in an AP, walk around with a laptop
running kismet or netstumbler and then decide what placement is
optimum. Try different channels too, there might be a lot of noise in
channel 1 which might not be there at channel 11.

I've once visited a farm where the cows had a little sending unit to
identify her at the feeding machine to control the food delivery. Talk
about high tech in the barn.

I'll bet that was foil backed fiberglass insulation.  Nice and shiny vapor block.
But due to its metallic content a WiFi killer.

Most auto supply places have a nice heavy gauge plastic case designed for 
large RV batteries.  I picked one up at Schucks for about $15.

I've converted a UPS from the old sealed batteries ($45 each) to using a 
couple of smaller automotive-type batteries ($21 each) without much problem.  
I don't know how much time the batteries will give me.  I was just looking 
for something to keep my systems up during quick power outages.

Google for a site with the keywords "DIY UPS". I found a site in Australia 
that had some useful information about it.

BTW, FreeGeek has UPSes for sale.  They are generally without any sort of 
warrantee, but I think they are only a few dollars (5?).  The batteries 
probably won't work, but for about $50, you could get some of them working 
again.

Best,
Kyle

Note also that Wacky Willy's store in Aloha has a large selection of
batteries, including the sorts used in many UPSes.  If you want to spend
bigger bucks, yer local Battery Exchange can get exact replacements.

APC SmartUPSes have a battery calibration function.  I wonder if they'll
actually calibrate to a significantly bigger battery than stock?

You can daisy chain a number of batteries off the back (there is a
port for it there) of everything newer / higher model than a smart ups
700 afaik. Calibration - (at least for the early models had to be
done) as there was no way for the ups unit to tell how many batteries
are attached. 
Or so my manual says ;)
BTW, all the UPS's I have are the non-rack mount versions, which have
the same series number but are a little shorter and wider ;)

Message-ID: <1068617380.19938.18.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

The current Redhat direction is expensive, I hope this doesn't
eventually happen to all distros.  I hope Fedora isn't more 
feature burdened than Redhat.  One of the problems with Redhat 
is that the bugs in one release will probably not get cleaned 
up before the next major release.  I wonder in debian land if 
this is the case?  The 7 series impressed me, but what happened
jumping from 8 to 9 and now 10?

I hope Fedora isn't blood everywhere broken.

I'm not really all that interested in going that route yet.
I don't like the idea of getting a version 1 system.  Over 
$100 for Redhat Enterprise, that's as much as XP.  What is 
so big about support contracts anyways?  Maybe I should do
debian on my next box and see about migration, but which 
release do I use for a server?  How can I establish a 
local debian depository on my network?  

I really liked slackware, seems in later years though that
it ran into problems.  How do you network install slackware
anyways?  What I've heard is that debian is the 
engineer's system of choice over Slackware.  Has package
tool been fixed?  It was broken in Slackware eight.

I'm surprised Redhat doesn't do OEM direct to ordinary people.
Setting a system up for a customer choosing the hardware can
save money on remote support.  This service if priced right 
would be welcome by many people.  At least the customer 
wouldn't be getting XP.

Does anyone have initial reactions to Fedora.  Maybe Mandrake
would be a better choice.

The version 1 system, as I understand it, has a longer history than most
distributions released today.

If Gaim hits version 1.0 tomorrow, does that mean it's an unstable thing
that was just written?  I think not.  :-)

Well, I only started using Slackware in the later years, so can't
comment on how much it's changed, really.  It's still winning converts
every day.  In the beginning, Slackware was the distro to use, and many
folks used it.  Then the others came along and people migrated away from
it to the point it was nearly a relic.  Today it stands at around the
4th or 5th most popular distribution according to most polls I've seen.

It's winning folks back.

> How do you network install slackware
> anyways?  

Very carefully.  <g>

It's not difficult to build a Slackware disk that supports installation
by FTP - a friend did just that for Slackware 8.1 a while back in an
hour or two, utilizing the ftpfs module.

You could do a similar thing with smbfs.

Just us a pre-mounted directory.

Or, use NFS.  If you have an NFS server already, there's configuration
support for it right in the Setup script.  :-)

I won't comment too much on Debian - I really dislike it, but haven't
used it except to bootstrap other distributions, so won't go too far
into that.

> Has package

I beg to differ - Slackware 8.0 was the first one I installed.  PKGTOOL
was far from broken.  How was your pkgtool broken in 8.0?

If you mean it didn't do dependency tracking - that's by design, it
wasn't broken.

Today, if you want dependency tracking with Slackware, along with an
Up2Date-like service, there's Swaret.  I understand Slapt-get can be
modified to do dependency tracking, as well.  I'm not much of a binary
package kinda guy, though.

That might be nice.  But they'd be filling a niche already filled by how
many other distributions?

I think Mandrake and Fedora have different paradigms.  From everything I
know about Fedora (which, honestly, is very little), it isn't much like
Mandrake.  Mandrake is unstable, bulky, but extremely easy to use for
the less-computer-literate out there.  Fedora is closer to a power
user's system, geared more towards server use, if I understand things
correctly.  Mandrake isn't geared towards a server setup, and I'd
question the competency of anybody who wanted to set up Mandrake in a
production server environment.

Message-ID: <200311112247.11525.alex@daniloff.com>

Hello Linux folkz,
I just compiled 2.6.0-test9 Linux kernel and found very interesting and 
annoying things.
1. It boots up initially much longer than 2.4.xx version of kernels.
2. Modules in 2.6. kernel have extentions ".ko" vs. ".o" in 2.4 kernels.
3. I can't load any modules using modprobe in 2.6 kernel

modprobe snd-cmipci
modprobe: QM_MODULES: Function not implemented
modprobe: QM_MODULES: Function not implemented
modprobe: Can't locate module snd-cmipci

I checked that snd-cmipci module exists as snd-cmipci.ko 

Could somebody tell me please if new 2.6 kernel is using different module 
loading mechanism than 2.4 kernels. 
And why module files extentions are ".ko" instead of ".o"?

Thank you in advance for any help or sources of information.

Alex

I have to throw in my two cents here. This is probably basic stuff for
you experienced Linuxers, but maybe the newer users like myself will
find it useful.

I've been using Red Hat now for two years, on around 8 servers and 2
workstations at work, and 4 servers/workstations at home. I was very
impressed when 8.0 came out, as it fixed a lot of the desktop ugliness
and menu mess from 7.x. Also since 8.0 I've not had any install
problems except for one finicky laptop, and of course some minor sound
issues.

In the last few months, I've tried a few other distributions. I didn't
spend a lot of time with them, but dabbled.

Xandros: This is Linux for a Windows user. It was very easy to install,
found and mounted Windows partitions as well as Windows shares on the
network. A friend of mine who knew practically nothing about Linux
installed it and got it networked in a day. Not my type of distro, but
it has its purpose.

Knoppix: I was very impressed with this, and I've got several Windows
people interested in Linux because of how well this works and how
polished it is. As it's based on Debian, I thought I'd try that next.

Debian: I hear a lot of the experienced Linux users in this group using
it, and hear so much about the wonders of apt-get, so thought I'd give
it a try. After installing Red Hat so many times, I was surprised to
find the installer for Debian was a lot less polished. I finally got it
installed, but was not able to get X to run. This is a standard nVidia
TNT2 board, but would not work with either stock drivers or nVidia's
Linux driver. Both of these options worked in Red Hat. Maybe if I had
more experience with Debian, I could have fixed this easily, but I was
stuck and didn't want to spend several hours to fix it.

Gentoo: Wow! I thought Debian's install was unfriendly, but Gentoo blew
it away in complexity. If you haven't tried Gentoo, the theory seems to
be that you compile pretty much everything. The advantage is higher
performance. The disadvantage is installation complexity. There are
three methods of installing, the quick, medium, and long methods (sorry
I forgot the technical terms for these). I chose the quick method,
which took me THREE DAYS to install, working on it here and there in
half-hour blocks. It's like download, enter a few commands, start
compiling, go have lunch while it's cooking. Enter a few more commands,
start compiling, go read a book. Anyway, I ended up with the same
problem I had with Debian: X wouldn't run, but everything else seemed
to work. I did enjoy the install experience, I learned a few
"under-the-hood" things, so I might try this again when my skills are
better.

Windows Server 2003 Enterprise: I know, it's not Linux, but it's an OS
that I tried on the same hardware as above. I was unable to get this to
install completely. First of all, when I switched to another computer
via KVM during some parts of the install then went back, Windows
wouldn't see my keyboard. I'd finally have to hit Reset and try again.
I finally had to waste 45 minutes watching Windows install, afraid to
touch the KVM. The install locked up at "35 minutes remaining." I
rebooted, restarted the install, and it locked at the same point. I put
in a different, newer hard drive, but again it locked at that same
point. I suspected the media, as it was a CDR of my legal copy, so I
tried a third time from the legal copy: same problem. I was able to get
it installed on a different machine, though I haven't played with it
much. I did find it very annoying with all the "take a tour of Windows"
and all the other crap that pops up. Hopefully that goes away after a
while.

IPCop: Not really a full distribution per-se, this is a Linux-based
firewall/NAT/DHCP server. I was very impressed with how easy it was to
install, and all it's features. It takes literally 10 minutes to
install, from start to finish, and can handle up to 3 NICs (WAN, LAN,
DMZ). It's got Snort built-in, and can do VPN, though I haven't tried
that feature yet. I've found it useful for setting up a quick firewall,
and gives some purpose to that stack of P-133's with 64 megs stacked in
a corner.

SuSE: I tried the Evaluation Boot-able CD version, which was pretty
impressive. Very much like Knoppix. I didn't spend a lot of time on it
though, as I wanted to install it on my hard drive. I looked for ISO's,
then realized they aren't available for download. <sigh>. Since I'm
just experimenting, I didn't want to spend money, and I wanted instant
gratification. I tried the network install, from SuSE's FTP server: WAY
too slow. I spent half the day just getting through the first maybe
20%. I bagged that, and downloaded all 6+ gigs of the install
directory. I haven't had a chance to network install it, but I'm
interested to see what it's all about.

Fedora Core 1: I've seen almost no difference between this and Red Hat
9. The install is just a tiny bit more organized, and a couple other
little tweaks, but so far it feel like RH9.

I've recently installed apt on my Red Hat systems, and it is like an
admin-dream-come-true for me. I like it a lot better than up2date, plus
it's free. up2date was free if you filled out the monthly
questionaires, but that adds up if you have several machines.

My conclusions: Since I have far more experience and have had very good
luck with Red Hat, I'm staying with RH 9 short-term on my servers. When
I feel that apt (or maybe yum, which I haven't tried yet) is solid on
Fedora Core, I'll probably switch to that. I've got it running on
laptops, my main workstation at home and at work, and even on some old
P-133's as web servers or firewalls.

Anyway I hope someone finds this gibberish useful.

"up2date" in Fedora supports up2date, yum, and apt repositories.

Edit /etc/sysconfig/rhn/sources, it is well documented. The default is
to use a yum repository hosted by redhat (i.e. up2date works like it did
before, but there is no registration process).

Behind the scenes, the three types of repositories (apt, up2date, yum)
are working together on using common metadata. In other words, apt,
up2date, and yum will be able to all use the same repositories - no need
for someone like me to maintain three seperate repositories of the
same packages.

I really like it, myself.

Hmmm... with a comperable config file?  I've found it boots in about the
same amount of time as 2.4.x for me.

Yep, this really doesn't matter as far as I can tell, though.

Well, you need the updated module-init-tools.

Odds are your distro has them available somewhere in some package. 
Slackware 9.1 ships with them, Gentoo has them available, I'm sure
Debian and Fedora do, as well.

Google is your friend.

Have fun... 2.6.0test9 is a good kernel, IMHO.  :-)

If I was going to buy new equipment I think I would be looking at this
type of product. I know using it to front end a Linux router probably
isn't want it is intended for, but it might work. If is doesn't this I
sure I could use it as it is marketed.

http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=21

The advantage to using something like this is the Linux box only has to
contain Ethernet cards and do routing. The other plus is the ability to
put the wireless unit where you want, outside.of the computer. The Linux
router could be in the basement with the wireless bridge in the attic
for an extreme case. 

The disadvantage will be using the network in ad-hoc mode. I'm assuming
roaming will be the issue if you have many of the units placed around
the site. Assuming dhcp leases then, I think, it would still be possible
to use. I'm assuming as you left the range of one wireless device and
the link dropped, if the link was established to another wireless unit
that the laptop would request a new dhcp lease and at that point could
be given a new gateway address. 

When I bought into wireless, the price was a little after at the halfway
point of the first consumer wireless stuff. I bought a card for the
laptop and a plx card for the router for about $40 less than a current
AP. I saved about$100-120 at the time using a Linux box. I have had no
issues using it around the house and don't have any dead spots. The
Linux box is upstairs and this probably helps a lot. I don't have a
external antenna, just the stub of the prism card hanging out the back
of the Linux box. 

When I first started looking at this set up I was very confused about
the hostap drivers. The deal with them is that it is set up to use
the Linux bridge. I mistakingly thought that I would need to attach a
Ethernet and the wireless card to the bridge interface. This would have
meant one WAN Ethernet, one Ethernet port for the internal network, one
Ethernet to drop out the wireless segment, and one ethernet port to
bring the dropped wireless back into the firewall / router. So I thought
I would need four Ethernet ports. 

The cool thing is, you can route to the bridge interface. That means
you only have to one interface attached to the bridge, the wireless
segment in my case. So the router only has to have the wireless card
and two Ethernet ports. The bridge port looks like any other device so
you can use iptables on the port. The logical path is wireless to bridge
port, bridge port to iptables, iptables to other Ethernet ports, WAN or
local network. This in was important because I wanted to use a bookpc
that only had two PCI slots and an on board Ethernet port. I thought it
was pretty sweet. 

Thank you
Russell

Most car batteries claim that they never need to be filled, and I
believed it, until a friend pointed out: Um, do you think people in
Arizona believe this?

So there is a difference between a sealed battery, and a maintenance
free battery.  A sealed battery, rarely a car battery, is truly sealed. 
A maintenance free battery is one you do not *expect* to maintain.  If
you look carefully there is probably two raised blocks that can be pried
open and there are cell underneath.

Now the difference is the maintenance free batteries *should* never boil
over, but there is still evaporation.  So unless you have a reason to
check, it is likely the batters are all filled.

Semantics, observer position, and industry.

If you put a battery in a charger you expect it to consume power from
the circuit, not power the circuit, i.e. pull amps

Put it in a light bulb circuit, you expect it to power it, i.e. push
amps.

Put it in a cell phone with a charger plugged in, and um....... depends
on what you are talking about.

So one way to look at things is where to draw the box.  On the cell
phone, you can draw the box at the charger cord.  If putting the battery
in the phone cause more amps to go across the charger cord, then I would
say it is pulling more amps.  Now within the cell phone is much more
complicated.  Some phones will not work without the battery in place, so
your above "a battery always pushes" makes sense.

You can argue that a battery in a charger is pushing back, but I am not
sure that is useful.

Think of it this way.  Build a circuit with just two batteries, one big
charged one, one small uncharged one.  Are they both "pushing?"  If yes,
replace the smaller battery with a device that causes the same draw on
the bigger battery, is the device pushing?

EE's are used to people having different frames of reference and
nomenclature.  There is lots of conflict.  Even the simple concept of
the square root of -1, 'i' is a pain.  'i' has other meanings in EE
land, so it is common to use 'j' which I think Kieth answered at the
meeting last week.

I would call the other training companies doing this and find out what

Run strace mozilla > strace.log.

Goto help-> Plugins

Quit.

Search for 'flash' and look for seg faults.  Maybe you have an older
(gcc issues) version?

Read strace to see where the plugins are being loaded from.

ls -l each of those directories *as the user.*

You will likely find one of two things:

1)  The directory is not correct.  I am trying to put everything in
/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins but not all version of mozilla look there. 
Often they looking in things like /usr/lib/mozilla1-4/plugins, or if you
are running mozilla from www.mozilla.org, /usr/local/mozilla/plugins/

I just put mozilla 1.5 from www.mozilla.org on my workstation, in
parallel with ximian version 1.4.  The www.mozilla.org version goes in
/usr/local/mozilla and I had to copy my plugins from both of the
non(usr/local) locations into the /usr/local location.

Lastly by doing ls as a user, you are checking if the permissions are
set right.  Sometime an upper directoy is not set right.

Also there is an app gflashplayer that might help test things.

And if all else fails, copy libflashplayer.so and flashplayer.xpt to
~mozilla/plugins.

This may explain everything you post then.  If you honestly believe by
replying, when you know nothing, and are completely wrong, is good for
the original questioner, then you are insane or mentally incompetent.
There really isn't any grey area there.

If you call your posts over the last month or so "trying so hard to stay
out of trouble," then you have failed completely.  I think to any post
you have made mentioning religion, as in a Christian belief (vs zealotry
of distributions), demonstrates you have failed.

AFAICT, I don't see any mention on the plug web site of what Plugger can
or can't do on the mailing lists. Perhaps, I can share my experince.

I was the president of the Tokyo LUG for a year. We had an incident
where a member was plonk'ed numerous times in one day and was kicked
off the list by the LUGs sys admin. This caused a big dispute within the
group. What ended up happening was the LUG produced a do's and don't
list for LUG members[1] Perhaps, PLUG could benefit from something similar?

Subject: [PLUG] homegrown WAP
Message-ID: <20031112155150.GA13569@gate.kl-ic.com>

Carla, if you are planning to do a bunch of sites, it would be handy
to learn a bunch about WiFi radio propagation.  To make any money at
this, you will have to get pretty good at looking at the insides of a
building and eyeball estimating where the dead spots will be, or you
will have massive overruns in material and time.

802.11b operates at the same frequencies as microwave ovens, so if a
chunk of material gets hot in your microwave it will likely soak up a
lot of signal in walls.  Others have pointed out how metal or concrete
can block WiFi signals, which is why the back-of-PC antennas are
risky (Maxwell trumps Babbage every time).   Multipath means bouncing
signals will interfere with each other, leading to dead spots in the
damndest places.  That means more WAPs to fill in the holes.

Cables eat signals at these frequencies; that is why the professionals
mount the antennas in the best spot, move the WAP to the antenna, and
use long ethernet cables to move the lower-frequency, higher-signal-
strength data to the WAP.  Antennas with gain are touted as the fix by
some folks, but all "antenna gain" really means is that less signal
goes some places and more others.   If you want a cloud, you need
an omni with low gain.  If you want a sector, you can use a sector
antenna and put the cloud where you need it.  A tall antenna with 
high gain flattens the cloud;  you will get less propagation above
and below the plane.  A big parabolic dish gives super gain and a
very narrow beam.  Etc.  You are filling a volume with energy;  
you can shape it, but you can't expand it with an antenna.  Energy
is conserved;  Maxwell rules.

Whatever goes for 802.11b at 2.4GHz goes in spades for 802.11g at
5.0GHz, and the new 802.16a metro wireless.  Something that just
barely works for 11b is probably going to fail miserably for 11g.
Cable losses go up literally exponentially.  Since you want to
eventually peddle upgrades, it is best to do it right the first time.

A good book with some chapters on antennas and propagation is 
"Drive By WiFi Guide" by Jeff Duntemann.  There is an OK book with
more of the software aspects, including a chapter on Linux,
"The Book of WiFi" by John Ross.   And of course, the fine people at
Portland Personal Telco know all sorts of useful things, and much 
good info can be found at http://www.personaltelco.net .  Invictus
Networks probably peddles all the gear you need;  good folks with
reasonable prices.  

The "Kismet" program is your friend - it can give you a crude measure
of signal strength.  A high power WAP is not much use if it does not
have good receive sensitivity - the link is bidirectional, and you
need good signals both ways.

Keep in mind simple electricity cost.  Even if you don't give a rat's
hind end for salmon, a PC consuming 150 watts is using 1300KWhr/year;
that's about $100/year for electricity.  Reducing that to 10-30 watts
can save a bunch of power and money, and leave a little more water
behind the dam to float a fish or two.  That's why an old laptop (with
the screen turned off or removed) for an AP is a good idea, a Soekris
box is a better idea, and an off-the-shelf WAP not a horribly bad idea,
especially if you can run Linux on it.  Old PCs containing slow, power
hungry, and marginally reliable hardware,  anchored to a floor,  are
not a good idea at all.

Good luck and happy hunting.  There is both science and art to this
stuff;  you can't make a profit at it until you know both.

I thought Gentoo had one of the best installs ever, very well documneted
and explains everything.

Gentoo is a source based distro and not recommended for newbies. On their
about page they explain what their distro is and how it works.  It may
take a long time to compile but you can customize the hell out of your
system.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0311120823570.12538@pecos.madboa.com>

We recently deployed a new set of (contractor-built) web apps at work
that use MySQL as the backing store. According to top, mysqld is using
about 75% of the cpu on our web server, a uniprocessor Sun V120
running Solaris 9.

That seems high to me, and vmstat/iostat indicate that most of the
work is cpu-bound, not i/o stuff.

If I were to start looking for mysqld options to tweak, what SHOW
STATUS variables are likely to provide good clues? I haven't done any
performance tuning with mysql, so don't feel bashful about making
suggestions that would seem obvious to anyone with a clue. :-)

I have one of these Linksys units. It's too bad non of of the iptable 
functionality is exposed in their simplistic web interface. Had I known 
at the time I bought the Linksys unit that it had Linux and other 
GPL'ed code in it and that Linksys/Cisco was violating the GPL I'd of 
looked for a different unit. After I read the first article on this I 
ran "nmap" and it identifies my WIFI AP as a Linux system:

Starting nmap V. 3.00 ( www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Interesting ports on  (192.168.2.245):
(The 1600 ports scanned but not shown below are in state: closed)
Port       State       Service
80/tcp     open        http
Remote operating system guess: Linux Kernel 2.4.0 - 2.5.20
Uptime 2.513 days (since Sun Nov  9 20:23:41 2003)

Nmap run completed -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 8 seconds

I also have a a Linksys 802.11g PC Card NIC that I believe has a 
Broadcom chipset in it and as far as I know there aren't any Linux 
drivers for it. I believe the AP itself uses a Broadcom chip of some 
sort as well.

I'm rather surprised the FSF and Cisco are in such long, drawn out talks 
since Linksys/Cisco is in clear violation of the GPL for a number of 
software packages.

Actually 802.11g is a 2.4GHz technology also, it just transfers more data.
 If you look into 802.11a, that is a 5GHz technology.  I wouldn't suggest
it though as it is not backwards compatible with 802.11b.  I have seen it
used in places with a lot of activity/interference in the 2.4GHz range.  I
would suggest installing 802.11g WAPs even if you have 802.11b client
products for the upgrade path.  The price increase is usually negligible.

Russell, yes, Zot flamed Michael and told him to go elsewhere. But he
did it while speaking from himself and "many others". That is far from
executing any membership authority. It would concern me if we used
administrator power to kick someone off who in the end only expresses
his opinion. That doesn't seem to be the case here. 

I keep myself out of the attitude discussion; you guys know each other
longer.

Oh sure there is.  In fact, I think there is a fully analog spectrum of
"grey area" between insane and mentally incompetent.

Now, Zot, you can only truly speak for yourself.

I mean, I personally haven't been HURT by Michael's re-enrollment (though
it's nice to have all of his semi-technical jibber-jabber off the
plug-talk list, which is where it went when he unsubbed plug), but my
roommate and I laughed our asses off at his homophobia and paranoid
delusions of sexual allure.  While these things aren't FUNNY in the sense
that they should be encouraged or bring joy, they are funny in their
absurdity and ability to inspire train-wreck awe.

Come to think of it, his technical posts are kind of like that, too.

But anyway, I know I made some comments to you about his posts and my
feelings toward them, but I hope you didn't interpret that to mean that I

Well, sure, but that's just because it'll drain your batteries.  Just ask

And this belief is based on... ?

You of course determined the state of charge of the battery after it was
removed from the car and made sure it was clean and fully charged, and
your memory is absloutely clear and not subject to fuzzy memory recall
syndrome.  I don't suppose the engine had any starting problems, that
might tend to drain a battery shortening it's life or charge, or were
you just rebuilding it for the fun of it.

It appears that Linksys/Cisco is now in compliance with the GPL and some

interesting to see how long the life of this hardware is, many of these
designs tend to get replaced after a very short while.

Seconded.  Not for lusers, and slow machines will find some of the compilations quite ponderous, naturally.  But this is a slick distro for people who really want a tricked-out system.  Community support is great.

emerge, the portage system, is probably as handy as apt (though I haven't much knowledge of apt)--barring the compile times--and the software is kept up to date.  You can update your system completely like this:

emerge sync && emerge world

Once or twice, I've had to patch something, which is a bit cumbersome using emerge:  but then, you can't patch a .deb binary at all, can you?

Hi all,

We need a PostgreSQL DBA.  I have a sample job description attached.  This
is _not_ the job description of the position in question, but it's similar
(it's the generic basis of several different descriptions).

We are actually looking for one person, but have two different sorts of
roles to fill.  One is mostly a developer-and-QA support role; a person in
this role will have secondary responsibility for our live systems, and will
mostly be involved in supporting developers and QA as they ask questions
about performance, wonder why something doesn't work like it does in Oracle,
&c.  Experience with PostgreSQL query tuning is absoltely essential here.
Alternatively, we will hire someone who is almost completely dedicated to
the production systems.  Such a person will need to have proven experience
in high-availability systems, and will need plenty of experience supporting
Postgres in such cases.  In either case, we are requiring some PostgreSQL
experience for this position.

You can mail your resume and cover directly to me, but please cc:
<careers at libertyrms.info>.

For those of you unfamiliar with Afilias (our parent), we currently operate
the .INFO and (under contract to PIR) the technical part of .ORG Internet
registries.  We use PostgreSQL for this.  Our operations employees work in
Toronto, Ont.

I don't know if Linksys is completely compatable with GPL, but they
are making a good effort and seem to be trying:

http://www.linksys.com/support/gpl.asp

The outstanding issue I know about involves computing checksums for
uploads to the box.  There is an interesting security issue there, so
I can imagine a combination of legal and engineering work will be 
required to solve that problem, and it won't happen overnight.  

So while Linksys may have been a bit clueless in the past, they seem to
be devoting significant effort to make things right.  I'd say they need
encouragement and technical help, not censure, and I'm glad FSF is 
helping them towards full compliance both legally and technically.

It's been available on secondary (read, not officially supported by
Mandrake) bittorrent sites to anyone since right after they released
it to the 'club' members for download. Also, I hear the floppy boot/
FTP/HTTP network install works fine if you have a reliable internet
connection. I just upgraded my entire house, and overall I like it,
no major problems except for having to manually run the menu rebuild 
script after installing all of the updates. I can't remember the
exact command, ls /usr/bin/* | grep menu

Yes, if you have an LG cdrom, check and see if it has the defect that
causes it to die before installing Mandrake. Apparently it has
something to do with the kernel initialization of IDE devices, so
installing over the network still can kill an affected CDROM. I'm not
sure if this is a Mandrake issue or a kernel issue, and Mandrake was
just unlucky enough to put out the latest kernel and get bit by it.

BTW, I did convert my Mandrake 9.2 RC2/MythTV box to KnoppMyth V4,
and I have to say a correctly setup Debian distro is nice, though the
performance seems to have gone down noticeable, but I am still
investigating that...

By the way, apt-get install foobillard, anyone up for a game of
network pool?

Unstable - everybody I've spoken to who has used Mandrake within the
last few years has noticed it has crashed a few times on them.  Folks
who switch from Mandrake to Slackware (or Gentoo) I run in to elsewhere
tend to rave about how stable things are now that they're away from
Mandrake.  That said, I'm sure there are folks who have fun Mandrake
without having any signficant issues.  A lot of Mandrake's instability,
I believe, is due to their super-patched kernel.  Slackware, for one,
uses as vanilla a kernel as possible.

Bulky - it's just so darned sluggish.  When last I installed it, it
installed, by default, a *ton* of startup services.  Yes, you can turn
them off, but I like the policy of stuff being off unless I turn it on,
personally.  Another thing folks who move away from Mandrake I've run in
to tend to rave about is the increased speed.  They can't believe how
fast their systems can boot and how snappy things (even bulky, slow
things like KDE) feel to them.

The above two pretty much rule it out for a server setup.  You don't
want to waste resources on a production server - it just doesn't make
sense.  Stability should be paramount, too.  Ideally, you really
shouldn't ever have to look at a server again except to update this or
that.

That's just my opinion on it... I'm sure there are folks who have found
other distributions to be slower than Mandrake, and who haven't had any
stability problems with Mandrake at all.  I'm definitely not one of them
- I've had both stability and speed issues running Mandrake, but don't
have either with Slackware or Gentoo.  A system that wouldn't run
Mandrake for more than fifteen or twenty minutes is currently my server,
with 45 days uptime, with three sets of 180 days each before this last
reboot... all reboots were due to power outages outlasting the UPS,
hardware upgrades, or... once... I did a root oops with hdparm.  :-)

Hjarf!

Which leads me to ask, how bad are cinderblock walls for WiFi?  I'm
considering moving into a slab 'n' cinderblock 4-plex and hoping I might
be able to share a connection with a neighbor or two.  Heck, even dialup's
expensive when you gotta get a phone line to use it.

Message-ID: <20031112232411.GA32270@themontagnes.com>

I have 2 identical servers, both with Libranet Debian installed.  The
network is win2000 server.  I set up Samba on each and one works
perfectly.  I didn't bother kerberos or joining the domain beyond "net
join ads..."  The other one is hard to connect to.  It seems very
fickle.  I can always ping it by IP (static IP).  But I get a "Network
Path not found" error when I try to specify the share or browse to it.
Eventually I can sometimes get it to connect but it always loses the
connection after several minutes.  I switched cables with the good
one, and used took out the NIC(using the onboard NIC instead).  It
appears that the signal never even makes it to the box.  The samba
logs (and ethereal) don't even show any connection.  Restating the
samba server seems to help.  I have the same problem using inetd and
running as a daemon.  I can run smbclient succesfully from the
localhost and "nmap localhost" shows port 139 open.
I'm pretty stumped here.

As someone who runs Mandrake in a heavily stressed multi-server
environment (CPU is normally at least 50% during the workday), I
would have to respectfully disagree. Mandrake has been quite stable
for me for the last two years running 8.1, 8.2 and 9.1 in production.

Sure, I've had it crash on me, but normally only on my home systems
running a mixture of weird obsolete junk hardware and lots of
experimental software installs. The one time in recent memory I had
it crash at work was due to a flaky generic motherboard that seemed
to overheat after a while. New motherboard, no problems. On certified
Dell server hardware, it has not crashed for me.

Speed issues are questionable. It seems that you have to be very
careful making remarks like this, because of the wild variety in
distribution setups. Redhat 8 crawls on some of my machines, and 9
isn't much better, but Mandrake seems pretty snappy on the majority.
Subtle things like video driver settings make huge differences in
perceived system response. Plus, if you are going to use a hardware
optimised version of linux for a server, you had better have some
idea of what you are doing and know enough to customize your install
to disable or remove unneeded services. I agree that enabling
services by default may not be the best choice, but Mandrake offers
their 'security level' choices to mitigate that. If you choose to
install a honeypot, set the security to none, if you want to lock it
down, set the security to maximum and let the scripts fight it out.
If you don't trust the scripts, do it manually. It's all about
choice, but I am really careful about what I choose to bash on in
public. (pun intended) :^P

Off the top of my head, I'm gonna guess you need to add some indexes.
Don't add 'em willy-nilly; there should be ways to analyze the log and see
which queries to optimize for.  It'll help loads if you can get a database
schema (i.e. how the tables/fields/keys relate) from the contractor.

You're trying to troubleshoot what sounds like an SMB WINS server
issue. Can you map a drive to the problem box from a windows client
reliably using the IP address instead of the name? net use J:
\\192.168.0.10\C$
If that works, start looking for wins troubleshooting on google or
hit the books.

Dear All:

I have a urgent need for help.  I got a new Dell 19" flat panel today and
I am using VGA connector to hook it up to my RH9 box.
The box is booting fine and I can see all the messages.
As the boot process finishes and jumping into the X login screen,
I got pitch black screen with this message:

    Analog Input
    Cannot Display this video mode

The monitor works fine as I have tried connected (via VGA as well) to my 
other Window box.

How do I get X to work properly under my new monitor?    Actually, I do  not

what the issue is.

Any help much appreciated....

Yes, the 2.6.x kernels use a new module_init package.  Read about it
with the kernel documentation in Documentation/Changes.

  You have to remember that WiFi is meant to be a Line-of-Sight or
Near-Line-of-Sight system.  Industrious WiFi operators have pushed the specs
*way* past the intended design.  

  That said, a concrete block wall will throw a lot of loss into the link
budget.  You can try to blast a signal through the wall... or you can try
going through the window and bounce off the neighbors house.  The best
signal may not be a straight line between two points.  Use diversity
antennas to help sort out the multipath signals.  

Sometimes multipath is better than no path at all.

I just let X try and figure things out all on its own with my laptop.  I
don't know how it is any different when you're working with a desktop
and a flat panel monitor plugged in to an analog VGA port... 

But here's my Monitor section from /etc/X11/XF86Config

Section "Monitor"
    Identifier  "My Monitor"
    Option      "DPMS"
EndSection

Really fancy.  <g>

Oddly specifying "net view \\zonker\graphics" and "net view
\\192.168.210.12\graphics"  yield identical results.  
I seem to be getting it to stick by specifying the ip and name in the
hosts file on the win box.  Funny that one works great while the other
sucks.

If it is the refresh the way to fix it would be with VertRefresh in
/etc/X11/XF86Config.  Read your monitor docs and find out what the
VertRefresh rate is and the HorizSync rate is as well.  Set them and
hopefully it'll work.

I have been having odd ide problems on my dual Athlon uber-machine since
I bought it.

I finally figured out what the problem was.

The drive cables were 1" too long.

I bought ata-133 cables that were within spec. I forgot to add in the 1"
of cable in the drive tray for the primary drive.

I removed the drive tray, added shorter cables and everything works MUCH
better now.

The thing that was confusing is that the error messages looked more like
a DMA problem than a cable problem.

Normally, a DB is fairly IO-bound.  

Questions:

- how big are the tables?  Please give both tables and indexes (if MyISAM 
format) as % of RAM.

- how much RAM?

- what kind of disk subsystem?   RAID?  I'm assuming SCSI...

- how many simultaneous queries?  SHOW STATUS will tell you this.
Look for max_used_connections.

- what is the ratio between SELECT and mutation operations (DELETE, UPDATE, 
INSERT, REPLACE INTO etc.)?

- what version of MySQL.  4.x will do better caching of some kinds of query.

- are you pulling a lot of data back and sorting it by fields that don't have 
indexes?

- do you have some nasty cartesian joins happening?

- what table types are you using?  MyISAM?  InnoDB?  

- You do have Paul DuBois' "MySQL", right?

My gut feeling is that you have insufficient indexing and your tables are all 
small and sit in the RAM disk cache.  However, you're still doing a lot of 
table scans.  That's my guess.  If handler_read_rnd is pretty high compared 
to the other hander_read_X counters then you may be table scanning.  This is 
in the output of SHOW STATUS.

MySQL performance comes down to just a few parameters most of the time:

- if you have about 50% or more of your indexes in key cache, you'll be OK.  
It can be less if most of your queries hit the part that is in the key cache.  
When the index stops fitting in the key cache, you start to hit the knee in 
the MySQL performance curve (at least with MyISAM tables).

- if you have carefully made sure that the per-thread caches and buffers are 
fairly small, you can handle a lot of simultaneous connections.  If not, you 
will find yourself swapping.  Then you die.  I've had desktop PCs that handle 
over 500 simultaneous connections without a problem, but that was after a 
little (not much) tuning.  

These are extremely rough rules of thumb.  YMMV.  Use with caution.  Do not 
operate heavy machinery while using this product.  Etc. Etc.

Best,
Kyle

Subject: [PLUG] Seagate SCSI Documentation
Message-ID: <19633-17048@sneakemail.com>

I recently ran across some excellent documentation on the Seagate site.
They do not have it indexed well at all, but the document is a complete
discussion of the SCSI commands that Seagate drives use:

http://www.seagate.com/support/disc/manuals/scsi/38479j.pdf

I noticed this referenced in the documentation for a 5 year old SCSI drive
I'm thinking about buying.  Funny how 5 year old 47GB drives tend to be
built a bit more stout than new drives...

The manual for that drive is excellent and reminiscent of "old school"
documentation.  I was surprised that there wasn't a schematic in the back
of the PDF.

http://www.seagate.com/support/disc/manuals/scsi/29280a.pdf

This is the first drive document that I've seen that details everything
that goes into the MTBF calculation.  In particular, the duty cycle of the
drive, whether a SMART warning counts against MTBF, etc.

I may have to buy a couple of these antiques just because the
documentation is so good.  They'd be good replacements for my 11 year old
2GB drives.

The problem was more likely due to the impedance discontinuity introduced
by the connectors associated with the drive tray.  IOW, if your connection
was just a plain cable of the equivalent length, I bet it would have
worked.  Of course, its a miracle that the IDE interface works at all
at 133 MHz.

Much of this is scripted depending on the security setting that you
define at the top of the install. Tweaking the post install, I would
argue, is part of any fresh installation - regardless of the distro.
Though, the less fussing, the sooner time to a live system.

This would be something that would think about switching (that and
package mgmt). I am reluctant to ask, but are there any stats or metrics
on the performance gains of Gentoo, Debian, Fedora/Redhat over Mandrake?

I've been curious about Gentoo. I know nothing about it, aside from its
debian like package management. Do you know this well enough to
elaborate on its benefits?

Funny how what you think you are writing is read by someone in a
completely different way. I have to wonder whether I am able to write
a competent sentence or paragraph at all? 

My point of posting was my take on what was not being said.
When someone is attacked, and attacked with the "we", even if the
person attacking, acts alone, if the crowd stands by silently, it comes
across as "we".  

Whether you read an implied "we" in Zot's post or not, is also, I
suppose, how one reads what is written. I suppose it is because I
personally have given up reading Micheal's posts, assumed most
others here have as well, that caused me to believe that there were
indeed "many" that would would cut him out of the pack and drag him
down. I don't mean this laterally. I mean make the situation so bad that
the person wants to get out themselves. It is the same thing as having
the admin remove the account. 

I have no issues with Zot, no issues with Michael,  I believe, Zot does,
by the way, have root on PLUG. 

Thank you
Russell

Turn off iptables and try again. I'd bet that your firewall is blocking
SMB. If turning off iptables fixes the problem, then open the ports you
need and turn it back on again.

  Xconfigurator. Also, run 'slocate XF86Config' and you'll find the file
where you can modify the monitor section by hand.

Hello Linux folkz,
Could somebody tell me please where I can get
proper modutils for new 2.6.0-xx kernels?
I need to generate /etc/modprobe.conf file,
but generate-modprobe.conf script is not included with my
current modutils-2.4.26-1 package.
Many thanks in advance,

A few things to begin with, if I may.

1. Nothing is installed automatically, except of course dependencies of the packages you install; and (as you've probably heard) everything is compiled, using your own optimizations (defined globally in /etc/make.conf).  So you get lean, speedy operation.

2. Updates are cake.

3. You can run pretty much any kernel you want, depending upon whether you want stability, speed, cutting-edge, etc.  Below is my output from "emerge -s sources", which should include all the kernels currently available through the portage system.

Message-ID: <1068705478.28298.10.camel@apollo.spears.org>

I'm using RH 8.0 and the default desktop.  What is the trick for cutting
and pasting between Emacs and say an HTML form? The simple texteditor
works as expected, and copy to Emacs works, but going from Emacs doesn't
work. I'm aware that copying something from Emacs puts it into the X
kill ring, I just don't know how to exploit that.

Why not?  I patch binary files every day with xdelta, it's quite handy. 
  It has the ability to produce freakishly small patch files for 
gargantuan binaries - which always mystifies me.

It looks like somebody else is using it on .debs too:

from: http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=6688

* The new ``pristine'' option (-p, --pristine) disables
   automatic uncompression of compressed input data, and is for use
   when data integrity is being externally verified.  This enables a
   tool written by Manish Singh (yosh at gimp.org) to compute deltas
   between the Debian dpkg utility's .deb format.

They use devfs, which is not ready for general use.

They use the grsecurity patches, which tend to have problems. 
(Especially with devfs.)

Trying to work with their programmers is an experiment in abuse and
torture.  (Having done it more than once.)

Some good ideas.  Implementation is lacking though.

Message-ID: <200311122257.16745.carla@bratgrrl.com>

Is it correct to think of metapackages as 'fakey' packages?  For 
example, I've been experimenting by removing individual games from 
KDEgames, using dpkg --force-all. It doesn't seem to break any real 
dependencies. Otherwise, trying to remove any individual game means 
apt-get wants to remove the whole works. 

I know that KDEgames is a terribly important package to do live testing 
on... :) what the hey, life on the edge.

Cool.  They need a new name though.  And is it true that Debian uses non-gpl 
code?  I thought they were they purest of the pure:

Curious.  So these are binary patches to prebuilt packages, correct?
Interesting concept, but I shouldn't think it very useful to someone who
wants to use a diff from a mailing list, or who has written their own
patch, as I have done sometimes.  Sounds like you need the source to
create these binary patches (and probably to rebuild the .deb); so from
an end user perspective, it should be much easier to just build from
source and be done with it.

Now in the gentoo world, instead of distributing a binary patch (if I
understand the xdelta process), an updated "ebuild" is distributed with
an added source patch.  Then the source tarball, which is normally kept
on the user's system, can be rebuilt with the new patch.

Well, different strokes, naturally. . . .

If you're going to reply to a pages-long post with 1 sentence, to a

Err, a meta-package IS a fakey package.  It has no data, only
dependencies.

Personally, if I ever use a meta-package, I always remove it immediately.
That is to say, install the meta-package and its dependencies, then remove
the meta-package and the dependencies stay.  Now you can deal with them
all independently.

Work like bear-bone charm.

I think the name's alright, if a bit confusing (with User Mode Linux
which, in itself, abbreviates to the confusing UML).

The problem I have, of course, is the implication that it doesn't require
a competent administrator, which all general purpose computing systems do.

You're reading that backwards.  UserLinux will differ from Debian in that
it will contain some non-open software.

However, there is a fair amount of non-free stuff in the Debian Non-Free
tree available in most apt sources.

A few years ago I asked a similar question on a solar / wind power list.
Could I use a car battery for my UPS. The answer I got back stunned me. The 
person who responded wrote that after a few months after installing a car 
battery in his unit, his children got sick with a mysterious symptoms. His 
spouse was getting ill and after a few more months of torturous diagnosis 
someone did a lead test that came back positive.
A UPS uses SEALED lead acid batteries for a good reason.

Well, the patch maker would need the old deb and the new manually 
unpacked patched and repacked deb to create the xdelta patch file they'd 
distribute.  But it seems so dramatically easier to just download the 
pre-patched version.

Does Gentoo also distribute the pre-patched source in addition to the 
patch, or does it make everybody apply the patch?

Wonder how the lead got out since its melting point is over 600F and boils

To help rule out hardware as the problem, you could try swapping hard

Even as a solid, it still has a small vapor pressure.  That is caused by
random energy distributions, and some of the atoms receive enough
kinetic energy to leave the surface of the material. Heavy metals cannot
be processed by the human body very well (if at all), and can build up
over time if the exposure is consistent.

Dittos- seems to me that they would have to be in regular physical
contact to get enough lead to poison children, like a favorite pewter
toy, eating it in paint chips, or something like that. If there were
some chemical reaction that removed the lead, I'd understand it, but
lead consumption is not a normal part of regular battery operation,
IIRC. Maybe his charger was doing something hinky?

I'd suspect a source other than a battery in an area that I wouldn't let
my kids hang out in, next to my server.

Uh, it works fine for me.

I drag with the left button over the text in emacs and then press the
middle button over the form to drop it in.  Is this what you're doing
or is there some other way to cut and paste that you use?

Under Redhat 7.x and probably other 2.4 systems as well there
was a changed in fstab.  Boot labels supposedly allow absolute
device references to be replaced with labels.  I have never 
been able to get it to work with custom kernels though where
having two drives installed with the same labels on their 
partitions would result in a conflict.  The other problem 
is that even unmounted, unplugging or plugging in an Inclose 
PMD9i drive bracket while the system is running will crash 
the system.

What is needed to make hot swapping of drives into and out of
ATA brackets work?

Could it have been the electrolyte, rather than the lead?

I've gotten spoiled with CDs and network connections, because floppies
are, IMNSHO, just this side of two tin cans and a string. I think the
cassette method mentioned on the list recently was more reliable.

Floppy issues I know about:
Cleanliness- since nobody uses them any more, they get pretty dirty as
an air inlet. I tape them shut on machines I admin.

Calibration- There are issues with tolerances on FDD's. Not knowing the
technical terms, some seem to be set on the "wider" and others toward
"narrow" and of course they do not play well. A work around that I use
for this is:
If you are trying to put data onto a specific destination machine, try
formatting the floppies on the dest and then putting the data on with
the source machine. Sometimes that works. Other times I have to use a
third machine to format them. Sometimes I can't get one to format for my
life. I have a case of unformatted, blank plain label 1.44 floppies from
the days when Software Pipeline was in Gresham that work for me most of
the time. I'll send you a few if you can wait for them.

It's easy to pull the floppy cable just slighty off it's 
controller producing a lot of errors that might give the 
impression all your disks are bad seeing the drive light 
come on and go off.
  
Another thing to remember is that floppies need to be 
unmounted before popping them out.  The mtools package 
is helpful for working with dos disks.

Subject: [PLUG] sustained ping attack
Message-ID: <20031113184433.GA14808@aracnet.com>

Hi all,

The topic is firewalls, in this case running Linux. There's an outer
firewall an an inner firewall in a typical DMZ configuration.

What sort of attack involves sustained pinging of the inner firewall (or 
any other box behind the outer firewall) over a period of at least 24 
hours?

The pings are coming from seemingly random sequences of IP addresses. The 
outer firewall is blocking the ICMP traffic, so other than a very busy 
syslogd process there are no ill effects from this attack, so far anyway.

Given that the attack doesn't seem to be achieving anything, why would
it continue for so long? Is there still some potential for the attacker
to gain something from it? The only thing I can think of is the potential
to fill up the /var partition and whatever might come from that.

Much thanks,
Terry

  Hold down the shift key and left rodent button while you highlight the
desired text in emacs' window. Go to the X application in which you want to
paste the buffer. Place cursor in the proper place and press both rodent
buttons (or button #3 if it's available) and the text should paste.
Sometimes I need to hold down the shift key when pasting (as I do in another
virtual terminal), then the two buttons without the shift. Shrug. It woiks.

Ah!  That's my problem. I was selecting OK in emacs, but when I went 
to paste, I used the window menu of the html form to paste, so I got
back what I had previously cut.  I think I remember now there are
two clip boards, the X one and one for apps. Emacs uses the X ring.

Unfortunately, I don't think I configured 2 button emulation, because
I have a scroll mouse and that was supposed to be more useful.

Thanks, at least I know what's going on.

Message-ID: <1068749466.27726.19.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I had two 40 gig hard drives, one ATA-133 and the other ATA-100.
I was trying to dupe one to the other because a system didn't seem
to be working with the ATA-133.  The first thing I noticed when
I opened the case is that the shop installed high density 80 wire
cable to the onboard ATA-33 controller.  It seems the drives are
slightly different sizes.

I tried dd if=/dev/hde of=/dev/hdf bs=512k which seemed to work except
I got a out of space or something error on the target and the Windows
system that's supposed to be on there gave an error about the drive 
not being LBA formatted or something about problems with the end of
the partition.  One drive appears to 41 gigs and the other 39.  The
data doesn't come anywhere near to filling up the source.  Maybe
I should /dev/zero the target, partition it manually as FAT32, then
do the same dd command with a count=something argument.

I'd try writing a specific REJECT without logging rule if you know
what's being pinged so that you can protect your logs.  Seems like
there are a lot of port 135, 137, 139,and 445 probes.  When doing
DENY in iptables I think it logs, there must be a way to disable
logging.  Some say REJECT is more polite because the attacker, 
someone who may just be someone making a mistake, gets an error.
I think slammer, SOBIG.F, etc. are sending massive streams of data
from infected computers where this process starts by finding an
open port of a vulnerable application.  I've run into tons of 
attempts against my apache server to overwrite DLL's and .exe 
files, course it's not a Windows box so until someone sends a
Linux virus I'm not prepared for I'm fine.  Log pollution is a
major issue though.  Noone wants to know about a problem that
doesn't have an affect and in fact isn't a concern.

I've read something about this on the unisog mailing list recently,
but, dangitall, I didn't keep any copies of that thread. Quite a few
people had reported seeing symptoms like the ones plaguing you, but I

dd isn't that great of a tool between two different HD.  If they have the
same geometry, then it works well.

I never tried doing dd on each partition, in theory that might work if you
then redid your MBR.  Someone on the list may be able to confirm or deny
this theory?

And, btw, Karla, even if you do --force-all, they'll all come back in
the next upgrade/dist-upgrade. Jeme's got the right idea.

The new USB key drives fix most of my floppy needs. I rarely carry any of 
the awful little beasts anymore. ALMOST every computer recogonises my 
keychain drive, except for DOS and other older Redmond spawn.

I think the quality of the media has plumeted in the past three years. I 
find it very difficult to find a decent diskette to make a "Tom's root/boot" .
What media do others rely on?

This howto (the hard disk upgrade howto) gives a more reliable, and
more general method.

Sections 5-8 are probably of most interest.

<cough>

You get speedy operation if you know what you're doing. There were some
tests done using various installations of Linux. *ALL* of the
distributions with binaries optimized for Pentium outperformed Gentoo. In
some cases Debian, which still builds for i80386, outperformed Gentoo's
custom builds.

The guess was that though the other distributions weren't specially
optimized, they still had people who knew more about the packages and
could simply choose the build options better.

In the general case doing your own build of programs/packages is silly.
The cost in time and electricity needed is quite large, and mostly for
not very large gains.

Thanks. Looking at the drive in Windows fdisk I
found out that the reported partition size is larger than
the destination drive by a small amount.  I wish there was
a cheat to fix this.  Can I fips the drive partition down
to the actual end of the drive?  The tar method of backing 
up drives that I've attempted in the past screws up  
the windows swap file.  I guess that file can be deleted 
though.  It may be a mute point, I suspect the system I'm 
trying to copy is set up wrong.  If I could hack the fat
table directly I could probably move the partition end
to the actual end of the drive.  I wonder if this would
have worked if these two drives were exactly the same
size?

Nothing I've read says ATA-133 drive shouldn't
work on an ATA-100 promise card, so the need to
copy a drive in the first place perplexes me.

So where are you using xdelta, then?

I believe when a new version of the source is released, that is distributed (along with a new "ebuild" without the old patches); but if only a patch is added, that is simply applied to the last official source tarball (which is usually already there on the client's machine).  This way the sourceballs can be downloaded from any number of servers.  It would be a bad idea to distribute a new tarball for every patch, some of which are written for gentoo specifically.

Note that applying patches is something emerge handles.  The user should never have to worry about it.

Say, I've been thinking of picking up one of those gadgets.  I wonder, when you plug it into a random Winders or a linux box, as you suggest, what is needed to read it, other than USB support?  I'd want it to work on any ol' machine without installing any software.

For I, too, lament the demise of the floppy drive.  1.4M is still enough for that critical text file, or a quaint and curious jpg.  But alas, my laptop doesn't even have a floppy.

Hi,

I've used them on a dozen plus machines with various O/Ss and have yet to 
have a problem other than USB connectors in odd places.  They are a real 
benefit.

Cheers,
Mike

I use xdelta to create diffs between large hourly backups on a remote 
server.  I then distribute the diff around to a few machines and can 
recreate any of the backups w/o having to download gigabytes per day, 
  another bonus is that the space required to store the diffs is tiny 
compared to the original files.

Ok, I've been futzing with this and aren't quite getting it- how do you 
remove the metapackage? It certainly sounds like a better way than 
force-removing things, if I'm going to have dependency messes then 
using Debian is rather pointless. :)

Chris didn't write this, I did.  But apparently Karla is not only blocking
my messages, but refusing to acknowledge my posts even in reference.

apt-get purge metapackagename

That's how I'd do it... it perhaps just use aptitude or even dselect?

Just remove it.  Take it away.

Right.  So you just use the metapackage to get the dependencies, then
remove the package.

I don't really use the front-ends anymore, but I remember in dselect that
you could select a meta-package and go to a dependency resolution screen
where you could pick and choose dependency-meeting packages.  On that
screen, you leave the required/recommended dependencies selected, but
remove the meta-package itself.

Pretty sure apt will do the right thing and not remove the dependencies.

I have never had to hold down the shift key when selecting text in
Emacs.  I wonder why you do.

What % of motherboard BIOS support booting from a USB drive?  I was reading a LJ
review of the Lindows notebook and noticed it allows boot from USB.

Ever since ATA 66 they have used 80 wire cable with 40 pin connectors.

I have a question if anyone is familiar with this subject:
I am doing "contract work - no specifics" for a start up company.
Another contractor and myself developed some Intellectual Property that
the Start up wants to get the patent on as it is now their new direction
(it's a Business Intelligence Software design).
We know they must include our names on the patent as the Inventors, but
the CEO also is adding his name (did none of the work), and wants us to
sign it over to the company stating that the company "owns it". 
We have only signed a non-disclosure agreement and nothing else. We have
not been compensated for the invention. Do we have anything to stand on
to just keep it in our names?
 
Thanks

Message-ID: <20031027154500.GA9900@blain.org>

How do I setup networking on a System V/88 Unix system running on a
Motorola Series 900?

Here is a pic of a similar box to what I have.

www.openbsd.org/images/mvme187-4.jpg

There are 2 ethernet connections on the back. One is standard rj-45 the
other AUI. I have run ifconfig -a and it returns nothing at all, net
even lo0. I also can't ping 127.0.0.1 so it doesn't even seem that
networking is even running at all.

I have also ran through the sysadm menu. I was kind of confused on it,
But I went through and messed with basic network setting... rebooted,
but still no network.

If anyone has a clue bat, please throw it at me.

Also, when I plug the ethernet onto a switch, the switch light shows a
connection, as well as the ethernet light on the front of the motorola
light up.

Subject: [PLUG] Hello from Lincoln City
Message-ID: <3FA879D0.4020604@humblebees.com>

Hello PLUG members,

My name is Chris, and I am a Linux addict/user from Lincoln City, 
Oregon. I have been using Linux for about three years, and until today I 
believed I was the only Linux user here in LC. I finally made contact 
with the other/s--they are humans too. I think?

I have two (maybe three) others interested in starting a Lincoln City 
LUG. Any information you can give on howto go about this will be 
welcome. (E.g. Go for pizza, drink beer, plot MS overthrow, drink more 
beer, go home, install another distro, puke beer, and stay up all night 
to tweak config files.) Is that how it works?

Anyway, we are serious about getting a LUG going here. I have never been 
to a LUG meeting anywhere and would like to know what to do. We have 
tentative plans to have our first meeting, November 17th, 2003. Between 
us, I am the only one who has ever done a Linux install of any kind, and 
for our first meeting I was going to walk the others through the process 
(baptism by fire).

We have a great location to meet. It will be in the back room of a 
computer gaming place set up by one of our wanna-be members for the kids 
here in town as a way to keep them off the street. We will have access 
to many, many networked computers and high speed Internet. If I have 
time I want to do a couple of different distro installs to give them an 
idea of some of the differences between distros. With several computers 
to work with, I can do this simultaneously. I thought maybe I'd do a 
Debian install (woody) and then do an apt-get upgrade to unstable for 
them, as well as, do a Red Hat or SuSE, or Mandrake (mainstream) 
install. Gento will take too long. I also plan on throwing on a live cd 
distro or two (Knoppix, Morphix, SuSE). We'll see how the time goes.

If anyone at PLUG has any suggestions, please let know.  I'm really just 
winging it here.

Thank you for your consideration, Chris

Are you sure, I would verify the source first.  Theoretically there's
nothing wrong with USB devices except that there's such a resistance
by manufacturers to make them work under Linux or anything other
than Windows it seems.  This could be solved by companies establishing
themselves on a model that only produces OSS friendly USB devices so
that the cost of doing business with Microsoft is avoided which I'd
say has been the major factor keeping non Windows alternatives down 
for years.  Forced purchase of MS-dos OEM agreements come to mind,
otherwise DR-Dos probably would have won.

I think the incompatibility of digital technologies with non Windows
systems on top of the complexity for Windows begs the question why
not just live with an old style cameras instead.  Right now I'd say
the trouble using technology compared to the benefits can be
improved dramatically.  Computer independent digital photography
techniques for this reason are becoming very popular.  What a 
waste that so many people will buy a special printer for doing
photographs because using a standard computer is such a hassle.

Message-ID: <20031025110429.5071bd91.light@hknet.com>

Dear friend,

	I live in Hong Kong and have been trying to help my mother in law who lives in Tigard connect to verizon's dsl service.  She has Mandrake 9.1and we have been close to getting connected, but no success.  The modem appears to be functioning fine.  With eth0 set up to use dhcp, ifconfig indicates her ip adress is 4.1.X.X (consistent with Verizon's subnet address).  We have configured rp-pppoe using adsl-setup, but the adsl-start times out and the /var/log/messages file indicates a timeout waiting for pado packets.  Her eth0 works fine ... I had it setup to use our local network when she was in Hong Kong earlier this month.  The problem may be in the user name as verizon assigns one for the account, another for e-mail and we weren't sure which one to use and whether or not it needs the @verizon.net or @verizon.com or nothing after it when setting the pppoe username.  SO ... there are many combinations and permutations and although her patience is great for a 70 year old, I thoug
 ht I'd better try to tap in on some local expertise and experience ... especially if anyone there uses verizon.  I've talked to Verizon's technical assistance folks and of course they only have details for Windows and Mac platforms.  This is interesting as Verizon's programmers alledgedly switched to Linux last year and saved the company $6,000,000.  

	If you have any suggestions or would be willing to give my mother in law a call to assist her, could you please e-mail me back?  Or perhaps the protocol is to post a response.  Thanks so much!

Yours truly,
Scott

Dear Fellow Geeks and Geekettes,

I come to you on bended knee for something that is driving me batty.

Specifically, I want to talk to my Handspring Treo 270 (Palm OS) via the
USB port. Evolution says that it wants to talk to /dev/pilot. Now I
assume that /dev/pilot is linked to something like /dev/ttyUSB0 or some
such. But there ain't no such. I have successfully talked to USB
printers and whatnot, but I haven't been able to talk to my phone.

Please, Mr. Wizard, help me!

Message-ID: <1068691746.6218.52.camel@gimli.genly.us>

Writing a bug free software system is a daunting task.  For any real
world commercial program I think it is impossible.  There has been a lot
of research into formal proofs of correctness to show that the code
implements the spec.  But the techniques are not practical.  Also, when
you are done, all you know is that the program matches the spec (a very
big achievement).  You don't know if the spec is correct.  Often a
system is specified and built, and then it is not quite what the
customer wanted.  But in the real world the spec is informal, and often
quite incomplete.

So the problem of writing a correct program is left to the skills of the
architects and programmers and the processes which support them, such as
iterative programming.  Unfortunately architects and programmers are
humans.  They have good days and bad days and they have all the
frustrating limitations that come with a human mind.  To a large extent,
programming is the process of managing complexity (using the techniques
you mentioned).  Even the best minds can't keep constant vigilance for
all bugs all the time.   Often a programmer is working on getting a
function or method to work in the common cases, then comes work on the
more rare edge conditions.  But what happens if you forget to work on
one of the edge conditions.  Or what if you worked on it, but you made a
mistake.  You got the general idea right, but the code is in fact
wrong.  Another programmer reading your code may understand your
intention, but machines do not.  As in civil engineering, if you get it
wrong and the bridge falls down, good intentions don't count.  Some
small fraction of this erroneous, missing or extraneous code may present
vulnerabilities which are accessible to a clever and evilly intentioned
virus writer or system cracker.  

Code reviews can help.  But this is not done everywhere. 
(Interestingly, for popular open source software, the code may be
reviewed in a totally informal and opportunistic way without the authors
knowledge).  But even in code reviews not everything is flagged. 
Programmers are often very busy and often find it hard to begrudge time
for a code review.

I like languages which support the quest for correctness. C and C++ are
not among those languages.  Pointers, arbitrary casting, lack of array
bounds checking, the ability to clobber arbitrary memory, and not
flagging memory problems when they occur are some of the problems.  C
and C++ rely heavily on the programmer for correctness.  A language like
Java or C# gets rid of these low level problems by requiring type
safety, garbage collection, bound checking, etc.  This still leaves a
lot of complexity for a programmer to deal with.  But it does lighten
the burden.  

I view the features of C# and Java devoted towards correctness like a
spell checker in a word processor.  The spell checker reduces spelling
errors enormously.  But that doesn't mean you writing a good novel.

I'm a Java fanatic.  But even I realize that Java is not appropriate for
every situation.  I can't wait to see what the languages of the future
will do to help the quest for correctness.

P.S.  I wrote this during compile times while debugging a Java program.
:-)

MSN now requires ssl to connect.  According to the gaim homepage, I

Well, that's just remarkable.  Why would 386-optimized software outperform that compiled for, say, a pentium4 right on it's host machine?  It's right counterintuitive. . . .  Do those tests use the same kernel?

So when you say "if you know what you're doing", you really mean, "if you know how to strip down your system and your binaries were built well".  Then again, gentoo builds include a default set of options (which can be tweaked by users as needed but aren't usually).  Does this imply those default options are not well chosen for performance?  Is it just a matter of gentoo's developers not yet knowing all the build tricks?

I should like to understand this.

Especially if it results in slower binaries!  On the other hand, being able to build in new patches easily is a nice way for us modem users to keep up to date.  There seem to be only a few distros which really facilitate that.  (But that was my second point.)

It's counter-intuitive if your intuition is only the most simplistic kind
of understanding.

I don't mean to say you're simple or anything, just that there are lots of
things that contribute to fast performance and default gcc optimizations
for a particular processor is just one small part.

I think that "if you know what you're doing" means "if the package
managers carefully tune their makefiles and compiler options for
application-specific performance boosts".

That is to say, the package management in Debian (or the like) is very
specific.  I think Gentoo tries to set system-wide compilation options
instead of application-specific compilation options.  That last bit could
very well be coming out of my ass.

I think this is closer to it.

There are some intelligent choices that must be made when conflicting
system and application compilation options can be chosen.

I think it's something like this:
Binary distributions:  Each application is carefully tuned for a generic
system.
Gentoo:  The system is carefully tuned for generic applications.

The result, at this point in time, is faster performance in the former.

Perhaps if a system like Gentoo could be built where compilation options
are deduced by some intelligent process that merges application
considerations with system considerations, a source-based distribution
could be really fast.

I've never used Gentoo, but I've built plenty of systems from scratch and
the performance of each application varies (in comparison with, say,
Debian) depending on how much effort I put into tuning it at compile time.

Well, hopefully we can get some of this monopolistic bullshit out of the
way and bring broadband capability to every household like they do in
first-world nations like South Korea.

Natural monopolies should be public endeavors and copyrights need to be
cut way, way down in either scope or time (I prefer to limit scope a whole
lot and time a bit).  Until you call this crazy non-sequitor talk, I
should probably point out that I believe the "entertainment" industry is
the biggest reason for a lack of broadband technology roll-out.  We should
be able to put 100Mbit internet connections in the home... just not at a
profit.

Check if usbserial and visor modules are loaded. For Treo you may need to
get the latest pilot-link and compile it yourself. Then after usbserial is
loaded you'll get ttyUSB devices (btw, usually you need ttyUSB1 not 0,
there is a HOWTO on that, Palm opens two channels and USB1 is the one you
want).

I don't know if my mail server was having issues that caused this
message to take 23 days to get to me or if your clock is off....

Or maybe the ~370K attachment meant it needed moderator approval? 
Generally speaking, it isn't polite to attach big files like that to a
mailing list.  I always just put something like this up on my webserver
and point people towards the URL.

Anyway, did you compile that gaim from source or use an RPM from
somewhere?  If you compiled it from source, look at the output from when
you ran configure for some clues.  If you installed it from an RPM, I
can't help ya, sorry.

A number of local people have tryed to give commercial grade Linux
training over the years.  This includes several of the well known
computer training companies and a number of smaller companies and
consultants.  Some of them did ok for a while, but not in the longer
run - at least not yet.  Of course, the corporate training market
doesn't do well in recessions and we are indeed in a high-tech recession.
On the other hand, people go back to school during recessions and
there is a good demand for Linux classes in career schools, community
colleges, etc.  Unfortunately, the public schools don't seem to have
money to hire instructors to satisfy the needs - but they exist all
the same.

Hey, Chris-

Bear with me, as it's been a few months since I've been down there, but
there's a computer shop near the north end of town.  I bought a piece of
crossover cable while I was staying down there about a year ago (like
$12 for 7 feet - it was a ripoff, but it was also a Sunday)...

If I remember correctly, there were some Linux boxes sitting in the
shop.  The kid who ran the place, I would guess, probably has at least
installed Linux.

The shop was on the West side of the highway... I *think* it was accross
the street from one of the motels, the trashier one near Wendy's (a bit
north of Wendy's, I think).... I realize there probably aren't a lot of
computer shops in LC, so you probably know which one I'm talking about. 
:-)

Anyway, might be worth checking out...  :-)

BTW, if you want to post and read from the list in a regular fashion,
you'll have to subscribe.

It's been a few years since chemistry... but I believe an electrolyte is
a chemical that dissolves in water, breaking in to an acid and a base.

Table salt (NaCl) is an electrolyte.

When you emerge a package with Gentoo, it downloads the tarball if it
isn't already on your system, then it downloads any patches the ebuild
dictates.

If you have, for instance, gaim-0.69 and want to upgrade to gaim-0.71,
you don't just download a patch... when you emerge gaim-0.71, it
downloads the whole gaim tarball.  The same is true with the kernel or
anything else - there are some big source packages out there.

It would sure be neat if they provided a patching system so you didn't
have to download the whole thing again, only a compressed patch, if you
already had the original tarball....

Gentoo does deliver the pre-patched source, as well as the patches, when
you emerge something.  If you want to not patch something, you simply
comment out the patch lines in the ebuild.

  Nope. Haven't been there since the last upgrade. Just tried it now; see

Yeah, I think that's par for the course.

I hate floppy disks.  I wish my laptop didn't have a floppy drive.

Just to be sure, as others have pointed out - you need to unmount the
blasted things before you eject 'em... and using mtools is an easier way
of dealing with DOS floppies.

andy,

  On my system, anytime I want to copy or paste text from a virtual console
I need to hold down the shift key. A native X app doesn't require this. I
cannot explain why, but it holds for pine, emacs, slrn, and any text editor
or just the console text itself.

You need USB drive support, WinMe and above have it.  Win98 requires
some driver installs.

Linux has great support.

Mac, AFAIK, has had support with OS 9.x and up?

Subject: [PLUG] Compiling Packages: Which Directory?
Message-ID: <20031114030256.GC2330@nellump.net>

When building software packages from source, is there any convention as
to which directory the compilation actually takes place in? I've read in
some places that it's recommended to un-tar the source package to a src/
directory, and then move to a complementary build/ directory before
going through the 'make' steps. In my experience, though, that doesn't
always work. Some packages barf completely when you attempt to build
them in a directory other than that which contains their source tree.
Any thoughts?

I've never run in to a program that cared where it was being compiled
from as long as it could make symlinks on whatever kind of filesystem it
was.

With my visor the /dev/ttyUSB* devices aren't created until I hit the
hotsync button on the cradle (I am using devfs), and I think I had to
manually create /dev/pilot to point to the correct one.

I never bothered to get it working "right" since it wasn't worth the

No, you got it working "right". ttyUSB* is created when usbserial is loaded,
and, unless you have some other device which loads it first, it'll happen
for the first time after you press hotsync. /dev/pilot is not a "standard"
device, merely a convenient symlink, so you do need to create it manually,
but only once (it does not go away), and you can point it to ttyUSB1 even
if you don't have ttyUSB1 yet.

I'm not a lawyer and I don't play on on TV...

You're sure that the NDA didn't cover things you might come up with during 
the course of your work with the company?  I recall that the NDA I signed 
when I was contracting covered this issue.  You say you haven't been 
compensated for the invention, but have you been compensated at all for 
any of the contract work?  That may be an issue.  Of course if they don't 
pay you they would be violating the contract and maybe that means you can 
tear up your side of it too.

BTW: I heard recently (from an IP Lawyer) that the law in Washington and 
California limits what ideas companies can claim from their employees.  
In Oregon we apparently don't have that protection - here they can draw up 
sweeping employment contracts where they can claim the idea you had while 
in the shower this morning.  So, if the company you're working for is in 
Washington (or perhaps if you live in Washington) you might have more 
leverage than you would if it's in OR (especially if you can show that you 
came up with the idea at home and not on the company's premises.)

<digression>I sometimes wonder what it would be like if patents were only 
issued to people, not companies.  You come up with the idea and your name 
is on the patent and it 'travel's with you even if you go to a different 
company... Wouldn't that be interesting.  After all, it's 
supposely 'intellectual property' - the product of someone's intellect.  
When you think of it this way, how can a corporation have intellectual property?

  I use two top-level directories for building from source: /opt and
/usr/local. I'll untar in one or the other, cd to that directory, then run
./configure, make and checkinstall from there.

  Others like to build in the /home filesystem. I suppose you could do it
all in /usr/src, too. The end result is determined by $PREFIX in the
configuration step: the executable will be installed in /usr/bin or
/usr/local/bin.

Yes, sometimes it barfs.  In barfing cases, you do what works.  In
lazy cases, you can usually build in the source directory anyway.
Some packages recommend against srcdir==objdir (e.g. gcc):

 ``First, we highly recommend that GCC be built into a separate directory
   than the sources which does not reside within the source tree. This is
   how we generally build GCC; building where srcdir == objdir should
   still work, but doesn't get extensive testing; building where objdir
   is a subdirectory of srcdir is unsupported.''

Hi, Scott.

I have Verizon DSL.  I don't use pppoe.  I just have a plain ethernet
driver.  The modems job is to make it look like you are on a verizon
Ethernet subnet.  Your mother-in-law may have a different setup.  But I
doubt it.

You are in Hong Kong.  Pretty cool!  Your job description in your

I am leaving your name off of this, and I would suggest you discuss
this under a pseudonym.  Every employer you hope to have from now on
will have a search engine, and your mail to this group is on the web
forever.  Yes, being careful about public statements sucks.  But dissing
your current employers or the expectations they share with many future
employers is a career limiting move.  Be very careful.  Freedom of speech
means you can say damned near anything you want, without getting beaten
or jailed.  Freedom does NOT exempt you from consequences.

That said;

I have my name on 7 patents.  One made a trickle of money, the rest
prevent me (and almost everyone else) from ever developing my own
inventions further;  I don't work at those places anymore.  

Patents are typically worthless.  A very small fraction actually make
money for the patent holder.  If you want to fight this thing, be
prepared for a lot of grief with a small chance of reward.  

That said, if you signed an NDA then you are stuck - the idea that you
developed on your client's dime may be "yours", but you aren't allowed
to disclose it without their permission.  So you can refuse to sign the 
assignment form, and lose the job of course, but you will not be able
to develop the idea yourself.  You can develop and patent *improvements*
of the idea, but you if you file before your former employer's application
goes public, then you are violating the NDA by revealing the information
you agreed not to reveal.  And they don't get to keep their patent if
your name isn't on the patent and assignment, so why should they file? 
Meanwhile, if somebody else files for the same idea in the meantime
(very likely) then both you and your former employer are screwed.

Have you done a patent search?  www.uspto.gov .  There are over 6 million
patents out there, about 500K are currently in force in the areas of 
electronics and computation, and chances are pretty good that somebody
has already come up with the same idea and already patented it.  It will
take about 100-200 hours of search to find this out.  But wouldn't it be
really awful if you quit over this, and it is all for nothing? 


If, by some miracle, you do get a chance to apply for this patent
yourself,  you will be paying between $20K to $100K to actually file
it, and at the end of an arduous process you will have what amounts 
to a license to sue somebody.  I write most of my own patents, and
do the drawings.   My patent attorney cleans it up, writes the claims,
and jumps through all the hoops of filing.  My patents typically sail
through in a couple of years.  About half of all patents applications
never make it through the process, and a large fraction of those 
remaining won't survive a court battle.  The Nolo Press book "Patent
it Yourself" tells you just about all you need to know to work with a
helpful lawyer.  Trying to do it all on your own will be frustrating
and risky.

Morality:  You were paid by your current employer to do things that will
make them richer.  If you feel they must compensate you extra for being
brilliant, you should have warned them ahead of time and they would have
instead hired someone less brilliant - or less demanding.  If you don't
like working that way, then by all means employ yourself.  Many do.  
But giving yp "your ideas" is the nature of working in a technical
enterprise.  They take the risks, and they get the big rewards.  You
get a regular paycheck, and if you cause a patent to happen you get
another bullet on the resume.  Your bullet item will not be less
valuable if the boss also gets a bullet item.  And if the CEO has 
done patents before, don't minimize his contribution to the process;
patents by veterans are better than those by newbies.

Intellectual Property:  I am writing an article about this, so I won't
go into detail here.   "Intellectual Property" is a metaphor applied
to an arbitary class of law, it is not a real thing.  The term first
appeared in the name of a U.N. Committee in 1967 (!!), and was seized
by the legal community as a way to improve their image and make more
money.  It worked, and now people are thinking that they "own ideas",
and paying lawyers billions to attack other inventors rather than serve
customers.  You can see what a mess that stupid concept is making of
technology in general, and is about to make of your career in particular.

This is a major reason for the dearth of Linux hardware drivers;  
manufacturers hide the source for their Windoze drivers because the 
sources reveal too much about the architecture of their chips.  Why
not reveal?  Because patents are so thick on the ground that any time
you design a chip you inadvertently violate dozens of them.  This is
very expensive to detect and prove by tearing down a chip, but very
easy to detect by looking at code structures and variable names.
Safer to shut up and join a pack of thieves doing closed source.

I won't advise you to roll over on this;  the relationship is poisoned
and you probably should move on, leaving the position for someone with
different expectations.  You should think long and hard, before taking
the next position, about what relationship you are willing to accept
with your next employer.  If you don't want to lose control of your 
ideas, you probably need to start your own company.  After 10 years of
that, you will find out how it looks from the other side of the desk.

If you do decide to stay, you can patch things up with your current
employer by helping them write up a "yellow dog" contract.  This gives
them ownership of the ideas you develop on their paycheck.  That is 
hard to swallow.  But if you can help, and research things properly,
you can limit the time period and the scope of the agreement, and that
will give you and others the freedom to move to new jobs, or invent
independently on your own time.  I've walked out on contracts that came
with stupid yellow dogs, and stayed with others that were more reasonable.
Help the next contractor out by clearing this up, hmm?


Personally, I think the idea of "owning ideas" is evil.  Because 90% of
my fellow citizens haven't realized this yet, I have to tread lightly
and compromise an awful lot.  I do patents, not to claim ownership,
but to make specific things happen, most good, some bad.  But sometimes
there is no upside beyond the evil itself, and it is time to walk.

Hi, Bill.

I run in to cut/paste problems all the time in X. You are right, there
are two places to save text.  I don't know the official names, but I'll
call them the clipboard and the kill ring.  Windows only has a
clipboard.  You use the X clipboard using the keys ^X to cut, ^C to copy
and ^V to paste.  The same is true in many X programs.  You use the kill
ring just by selecting text to load it, and the middle button to paste
it.  You can also emulate the middle button by pressing the left and
right buttons at the same time if you have middle button emulation
enabled.

The model of kill ring and clipboard seems fine to me.  The problem is
that some programs implement one, but not the other.  So you end up
having to get something from the kill buffer to the clipboard and the
other way around.  Under KDE there is a tool bar tool called Klipper
which will do this for you.  I use it frequently.  The other problem
with this two buffer model is when a program implements only of these
methods its not always obvious which method it uses.  You have to play
with it.  

It seems to me the kill buffer method is almost always implemented.  The
clipboard may or may not be.

I'm about 1 for 6 with floppies lately.  Interestingly the last ones to fail 
were some Windows install disks that I was trying to use to install Linux on 
a laptop :-)

Floppies need to die a quick death.  Preferably about five years ago.

I don't mount and unmount floppies.  I use "mdir" and "mcopy".  I

Are there any schools or charities or sheltered workshops out there

Message-ID: <20031114055809.GA5203@gate.kl-ic.com>

I have been using USB2 cages for hotswap and backup.  Just so you know,
the new Fedora Core 1 (kernel 2.4.22-1.2088.nptl) has Alan Cox's new
IDE hotswap mods.  This means that, if you have the right chipset, you
can now hotswap drives IDE on a running system:

You will of course need to unmount and mount the file systems before and
after, and you will need an IDE chipset that works with the driver, and
you will need a proper hotswap cage with a proper power controller, and,
and, ...

I am using a Promise TX133 board, rebranded as a Maxtor ATA-133, and it
seems to work fine.  After I get my server converted to Fedora Core this
weekend, I can toss out all that balky slow USB2 stuff.  Then I will 
post the technique far and wide.

One of the things I do when I'm trying to resolve dependencies, is put the 
filename into google. 

It's easier than just about any other method I've come across.

Never understood why the separate build directory, except in cases of building multiple versions (different architectures, say) or creating a binary package.  I've never had to bother.

I'd say you'd have to install OpenSSL from the sources to get the .so.4.
Or try a symbolic link to the older version:

ln -s /lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.6b /lib/libcrypto.so.4

and see if that works. 

Or wait until real help comes from the gurus here. ;)

If you have hotplug enabled, then yeah... that's basically it.

You might even be able to use one of the automount thingies (I've never
played with them) so you just plug it in and use it.  Just like
Windhoze.

So now what I would know is, couldn't gentoo make the same tunings with a patch to the makefile?  I would expect gentoo to be able to tune things as well as any other distro--but then, mine is "only the most simplistic kind of understanding".  (Perhaps certain tweaks won't work with certain compiler options, but I believe the ebuild can override those options as needed, so it ought to be able to build pretty much the same binaries as Debian or 'Drake, if they are actually faster per se.)

There are user-definable global defaults, but see my last parenthetical.

Well, that's part of the draw, so I hope gentoo can improve those benchmarks in time.  Looking at that linmagau.org article, I do suspect that a better kernel than the "stock" gentoo kernel would have helped somewhat.

Geeze, I didn't look at it very closely - they actually used the stock
gentoo kernel?  That thing isn't meant to be used for anything except
getting enough of a system together to be able to reboot into your own
custom-compiled kernel.

Craziness.

I wonder what kind of CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS they used, too?  They just
said -march=pentium3 -pipe -O3 ... it's been shown -O2 and -Os can
produce faster binaries depending on what you're working with.  They
also failed to mention if that was the CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS or both.

It might also be interesting to see if the differences are greater when
you're dealing with an AMD system - be it 32- or 64-bit.  AFAICT, the
GCC devs have really put some emphasis on optimizing for the Athlon.

Maybe during Christmas Break I'll take the time and try to reproduce
this guy's findings.

Set it up plain Ethernet w/ DHCP and everything should work fine.
Verizon's DNS servers are 4.2.2.2, 4.2.2.3, 4.2.2.4 
Verizon support is useless.
Verizon emails are handled by a third party and is web based as far as
I know (I never used it). 
Verizon's user names are usually something like res###AA and don't
need to be used to logon. 

I think qwest still uses ppoe in some areas, but as far as I know
verizon is completely ppoe free.

Winderz95/ 98 needs a driver. Win200 and up it shows up as a lettered 
drive. In linux its a usb device, I forgot which one.
Its kinda fun to march up to someone Windrz machine and plug in your 
keychain and have them say, "Is THAT what that thing (USB) is for?"

Jason,

  The newest issue of Linux Journal has a detailed, step-by-step article on
getting your systems properly set up to use a USB flash storage thumb. Based
on that, I bought a 256M model yesterday at ENU. This weekend I'll make sure
it works with the notebook and workstation.

Odd. I've been able to use a plain-old mouse drag on every Linux

Keith,

  If someone modified a target thrower they'd probably make great skeet
targets. I, too, have noticed an increased percentage of new floppy disks
that just won't work on a linux box. Oh, well.

For what it's worth, here is the FreeBSD handbook position on compiling
from source vs. installing binary packages:

"Package Benefits [i.e., installing binaries]

* A compressed package tarball is typically smaller than the compressed
tarball containing the source code for the application.

* Packages do not require any additional compilation. For large
applications, such as Mozilla, KDE, or GNOME this can be important,
particularly if you are on a slow system.

* Packages do not require any understanding of the process involved in
compiling software on FreeBSD.

Ports Benefits [i.e., compiling source]

* Packages are normally compiled with conservative options, because they
have to run on the maximum number of systems. By installing from the port,
you can tweak the compilation options to (for example) generate code that
is specific to a Pentium IV or Athlon processor.

* Some applications have compile time options relating to what they can
and cannot do. For example, Apache can be configured with a wide variety
of different built-in options. By building from the port you do not have
to accept the default options, and can set them yourself.

* In some cases, multiple packages will exist for the same application to
specify certain settings. For example, Ghostscript is available as a
ghostscript package and a ghostscript-nox11 package, depending on whether
or not you have installed an X11 server. This sort of rough tweaking is
possible with packages, but rapidly becomes impossible if an application
has more than one or two different compile time options.

* The licensing conditions of some software distributions forbid binary
distribution. They must be distributed as source code.

* Some people do not trust binary distributions. At least with source
code, you can (in theory) read through it and look for potential problems
yourself.

* If you have local patches, you will need the source in order to apply
them.

* Some people like having code around, so they can read it if they get
bored, hack it, borrow from it (license permitting, of course), and so
on."

http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-overview.html

FreeBSD generally tries to make both paths available, but the impression I
get is that most users compile from source to update their systems (I do).

Those tests weren't very comprehensive, as the tester admits.  I googled for other benchmarks, but found surprisingly little.  Gentoo's own self-congratulatory page is rather exclusive:

Rich,

I think we're on some sort of parallel wavelength or something. I
generally agree with all your posts and such. To top it off, I also
bought a 256 meg USB drive from ENU yesterday. :)

In Fedora, all I had to do was type "mount /mnt/flash" to get it to
work. Also there's a GUI tool, I think System Tools, Drive Utility.

On my RH9 systems, it was a bit more work:
  su
  mkdir /mnt/flash
  mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/flash
  chmod -R 777 /mnt/flash
  exit

I'll check out that link you sent, maybe that will help me make RH9 as
friendly as Fedora, so I can mount the darn thing as non-root.

Chris, that's the way I remembered.  My problem was that I set my mouse as

the wheel as the 3rd button.

  Use the net Luke,  http://www.rpmfind.net/ is your friend.  

  I had a lot of trouble updating libcypto on one of my machines.  The

Message-ID: <BAY9-F46IxNaeJz9YTD000112bc@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

I am looking for a Linux CD Burning software.  My Linux distrib comes with
xcdroast-0.98alpha13 but keeping complaining (when I tried
to do CD to CD copy):

   no cd/dvd recorder found or the recorder format is not supported.

This is even though it recognized automatically my CD writer as well as my 
CD/DVD combo drive.

So I searched and downloaded the alpha15 version but running
configure caused an error because it could not find GLIB/bin.  configure has 
an option
to disable this test but it still performs the test no matter what.

Is there another common CD burning software that I can try?

thanks

I use, personally, mkisofs, cat, dd, and cdrecord as my CD burning
suite.  :-)

A lot of folks seem to be really impressed with K3B, I think it's
called, for their graphical burning needs.  It's a KDE app, but I would
guess is able to run outside of KDE, too.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux kernel ties to the filesystem
Message-ID: <1068834755.9988.295.camel@localhost.localdomain>

The Linux kernel makes certain assumptions about the filesystem
directory hierarchy. For example, it assumes that there's a
/dev directory (let's ignore devfs). Obviously it knows about
the root (/). I'm wondering what other assumptions _it_ makes.
Note that I'm not talking about daemons or init.

Does the kernel know about /lib or is there another mechanism
that tells the kernel about it?

Is there anything in /etc that the kernel is aware of?

What about /var?

I know this is a difficult question given all the functionality
in the Linux kernel these days.

Message-ID: <BAY9-F64HV6J83jWKjY0001183f@hotmail.com>

Dear all:

I got a new RH9 box setup at work and just for
curiosity, I checked dmesg to make sure that
all components were ok during boot time.
I then noticed this line in dmesg:

  eth0 NIC link is up 10 Mbps half duplex

I actually think that I should be getting more than 10Mbps.
I need to verify with my network support but just wondering
if there is something that I can do to set it higher on my end?
And why is it half duplex?  Shouldn't it be full duplex?

thanks

I didn't know it made any assumptions about the filesystem at all. 
AFAIK, you can put /dev wherever you want to (although it would likely
break other programs which rely on /dev being at /dev)....

I know you can put /proc wherever you want to, although not having /proc
where it normally iswill break programs left and right.

Why does the kernel need to know about /lib at all?

For modules?  It'd be the module (init) tools for that.

I certainly don't know of anything..

Maybe if you used the old kernel httpd thingy?

I don't think the kernel itself is really all that functional as far as
the filesystem is concerned... it's almost entirely user-space
applications and daemons that write or read from files on the
filesystem, which in tern have an effect on the kernel.

I could be mistaken, though... I just didn't think the kernel cared much
at all about the filesystem.

I think there are tools available for specific network cards to force it
to 100/Full duplex, although I've never had a need to play with such
things, so I haven't.

What kind of network card is it?

10Mbps means you're on a 10BaseT network, not a 10/100 network.  At
least, that's what the network card thinks.

The half-duplex means, more or less, you're using a hub instead of a
switch.  I suppose there are hubs out there that support full-duplex, as
there are hubs that support 100Mbps connections, they're just both
somewhat rare, since switches are so darned common these days.

It looks, to me, like you're using a 10BaseT hub between your computer
and the rest of the network.

One way to test for a hub might be to start using tcpdump or something
similar and watch for packets coming in for other hosts.  If it's a
regular occurance, then odds are you're using a hub rather than a
switch.  If, on the other hand, you're just seeing packets for your
host, then it's probably a switch (or a very very quiet network).

I'm sure there are other ways to test that out... I just don't know of
them as I've never had a need to test such things - I always know what
kind of network hardware I'm using at the time.  :-)

And just in case anyone gets the wrong idea, please note that 
CAR BATTERIES CONTAIN SULFURIC ACID as an electrolyte.

It's nasty poisonous burninating corroding stuff that goes everywhere
when a battery explodes.  I am forever grateful that when I had a car
battery explode, it was outside under the hood of my car rather than,
say, sitting in the same room as me.

I use cdrecord from the command line and mkisofs for the building of the

Did you wind up with an incredibly clean engine compartment?  My battery
got punctured in an accident by a bit of radiator.  I think I got an acid
steam cleaning in there.

Verizon has cleaned up the bizarre user names.  You can now pick a real
user name.  The user name is used to access your Verizon web account
(for billing and so on), and your mail pop3 or web mail.  You can also
have five sub accounts for family members.  Each with their own password
and pop3 account.

Verizon does supply web mail, but I almost never use it. I always use
pop3.

So far I've been pretty pleased with Verizon.  I don't need their
support, so that hasn't been an issue for me.  There have been the
occasional dropouts.  But typically they last less than a minutes. There
was also a problem with their DNS servers being dog slow for a few
weeks.

Vincent,

  This can happen if the kernel does not have ATAPI as SCSI emulation built
in. The past couple of years I've run 'mkisofs' and 'cdrecord' from the
command line rather than using the xcdroast GUI front end and it works just
fine.

Well, fluxbox-0.1.14 didn't like it when I compiled that particular

I'm planning on picking up USB port converters for both serial and
parallel in the near future and was wondering if there are any caveats a
Linux user should bear in mind when selecting make/model. I've noticed in
the kernel menuconfig that there seem to be a large array of drivers for
these sorts of devices. Are any known to work better than others?  Also,
what price point should I expect to encounter for a decent product? I've
only shopped USB-to-serial converters so far, and have seen upwards of
$50 (Fry's) and as little as ~$10 (eBay auction, new item).

I like XCdroast. AFAIK it will only find the drives you set up correctly 
as SCSI drives though. What does "cdrecord -scanbus" return?

I've used a Belkin serial converter with success (~$30).  If you dig around 
the kernel source (drivers/usb/serial), the commented .c files, will 
indicate various supported models.  Not all supported makes/models will be 
mentioned but if you can find one still offered retail, it's a good bet.

Belkin seems to be widely available and hence popular and largely supported. 
  Have no experience with parallel devices.

That's odd - I've compiled that specific thing probably a dozen times
since it was released (for a small period of time, I was maintaining the
Slackware package for Fluxbox)...

It never gave me any problems.

There are more poisonous materials in an average household than diluted 
sulfuric acid as in a car battery. Yes, it will eat cotton and other 
fabrics and irritate your skin but otherwise it is not even known to 
cause cancer.

Yeah, this weirds me out, too.  Something is fubar.

I've never had the tiniest bit of trouble with pasting either from copying
or cutting.

Phew.  Your house, maybe.

I think the strongest chemical in my house is Siracha rooster sauce.

OK, seriously... there's some heavy poison in some of my electronics,
certainly, but nothing volitile.

So sulfuric acid is less dangerous than red meat?

xcdroast and the rest of this kind are front-ends to cdrecord.
So, make sure you have cdrecord, and run "cdrecord -scanbus". If that does
not find your CD, stop right there, nothing will work until you get it
fixed. There are many reasons for failure, post the output of cdrecord and
we'll see what to do next.

Just to clarify: I don't mean that FluxBox cared where it's source tree
was located, but rather that it didn't like my trying to have the source
tree in one directory, and going through the build procedure in another.
Making the package right there in its source directory produced no
problems at all.

Just one note.. since things are starting to move towards the
not-yet-released 2.6.0.......

cdrecord -scanbus won't work with 2.6.  2.6's IDE-SCSI emulation isn't
quite right, but that's ok, since we have no use for it any more.  CD
recording works properly with 2.6, no need for the IDE-SCSI emulation. 
I think you just say cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc or whatever.

Ahhh... ok... I think we've had mis-communication.  I always build right
in the source directory, and have never had a problem with it.  The
location of the source directory, AFAIK, doesn't matter.

To be honest, there a whole lot less planning and forethought then you
might expect here.  This came together way faster than anyone thought,
including the people doing it.  It was "Hey there a bunch of machines
and this Community Center that Hillsboro was to use to help a troubled
complex, and um what about we get parts, teach kids how to put them
together, and um..."  and next thing I know, its "So Pinnacle donated a
bunch of old machines, and we can't use MS without a license, do you
think we can run Linux?"  to "Phil has wired the lab, Verizon has DSL
hooked up, and Phil installed RH8 on the servers and we are thinking
about opening next week." (Phil is retired and has lots of free time).

There were a few more conversations, the buying of a gateway/firewall
server, the installing of Eric's filter, and then the "Do you guys
realize this is next week" shock call for volunteers.

The results are spectacular.  The kids, with no advertising, were lined
up.  They probably do know what they are running, and the city loves the
costs.

Since opening someone else went in to install the flash player, and
wound up upgrading the systems to RH9, and tightening down the gateway
firewall.

We will soon be doing classes on net surfing and Open Office.  We will
likely need more volunteers.  There are background checks involved
(working with children).

I'll look.  As my memory goes I realize I keep getting things cross 
connected.  There was also a script to convert a SQL database (PostgreSQL) 
into a dia format.  I probably got them mixed up.

Thanks for the pointer.

The ONLY package that I can recall doing funny things with source/build
trees is GCC... and I've built thousands of packages.

Build GCC that way and come back and tell us about how stable things are.

Subject: [PLUG] Clinic tomorrow?
Message-ID: <8665hmebxl.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I haven't seen (or don't remember seeing) an announcement in the last
few days.  My nth_fooday script (day_of_week=1 for Sunday, ..., =7 for
Saturday) is telling me:

   $ cal | awk 'BEGIN { day_of_week = 7 ; nth_week = 3 } NR == 1 { month = $1 ; year = $2 } NR > 2 && NF > (7-day_of_week) { week++ } week == nth_week { print month,$(day_of_week + NF - 7) ", " year }'
   November 15, 2003

I assume the clinic is on as usual, but that the announcement was
eaten by the family dog.

BTW, January's first Thursday lands rather auspiciously:

   $ cal 1 2004 | awk 'BEGIN { day_of_week = 5 ; nth_week = 1 } NR == 1 { month = $1 ; year = $2 } NR > 2 && NF > (7-day_of_week) { week++ } week == nth_week { print month,$(day_of_week + NF - 7) ", " year }' 
   January 1, 2004

What is the plan for the January 2004 General Monthly Meeting?

That was basically my question. As Russell Senior pointed out in his
reply, the GCC build docs specifically recommend that you *don't* build
in the source directory, and this is probably where my confusion first
began. I couldn't think of any reason why it would matter, either, but
figured I may as well double-check with the group. :-)

Rob,

  I don't think the problem is with cdrecord. When I tried running xcdroast
and scsi emulation was not available in the kernel, xcdroast could not find
the ATAPI cdrom drive with the _source_ cdrom from which to run mkisofs.

  The burning (with cdrecord) is on the scsi-bus cd-rw drive. That has no
problems.

  Interestingly, mkisofs from the command line has no problem seeing the
ATAPI cdrom drive, but xcdroast does. Shrug.

I *did* have this problem once.  I can't remember if it was on my early
Slackware system, or the RedHat 6.1/6.2.  In any case, I could copy text
just fine.  But, when I wanted to paste it into an xterm, I had to use
the [Shift][Mouse#2] combination.  It certainly drove me crazy, and I never
could find the config parameter responsible for the bad behavior.  

The problem was "solved", when I upgraded to a more recent distro.  (Could
it have been RedHat 6.2 or was it 7.1?).   Anyway, it certainly hasn't been
a problem for a few years.

I must confess, I've forgotten who (on this very list) enlightened me.
I even tried a Google of "buchholz site:lists.pdxlinux.org" to see if
I could find anything in the archives, but didn't have much luck.  I
suspect that posting was circa-'98.

I'm not sure any new floppies have been made this decade.  Or if they
are, they're of especially poor quality.  It's amazing, any floppies
I've bought since I was in high school has always left me with the
mystery "It copied, but will I be able to read it?"

Meanwhile, I have old 5.25" 360k and 1.2MB floppies in storage that
worked last time I tried them, and I would guess that they'll probably
still read next time I try them.

The application is filled out by someone, and any name can go on it. 
Whether or not someone worked on it is an ego things usually.  To some
extent the CEO might have to prove he worked on it if someone fought the
patent.

You actually have quite a bit more.  Read your NDAs very carefully.  If
you do not sign over IP rights in there, then you are good.  Contact an
IP lawyer at that point.

It might be a case of No patent, or His Name on patent.  Likely you
cannot file the patent yourself since the NDA would prevent that, but
they may not be able to file without your permission either.

Avoiding the patent vs. no patent war, I would contact any IP lawyer for
a free consult after reading the NDA.  Find out what rights you have.

MY guess is the following:

1)  You can force them to pay you more money.
2)  You might be able to force them to give you patial ownership of the
patent.
3)  You can use #1 and #2 to negotiate.
4)  You realize its an ego thing from your perspective as well, and come
to grips with maximizing #1 and #2.

We will definitely have people who have done that before. Whether or not
they will be able to do it with your laptop remains to be seen. Laptops
are more idiosyncratic than other computers.

Only that the modules are kept there.  If the kernel needs a module to
finish booting (say IDE for instance), it could read it from there.

Well, if the root designation in /etc/fstab is screwed up, the kernel
will panic and the boot process can not proceed.  Seems like a kernel
dependency to me.

If LVM is enabled in the kernel, it will need to be able to see
/etc/raidtab.  

That is all that I can think of.
> 
> What about /var?

The kernel boot info is written to several files, but I have a feeling
that information is stored in a buffer until something can be done with
it.  On my system, a daemon called "bootlogd" is the first one started,
and then it is stopped at the end of the second runlevel.  Actually, a
start command is used to "stop-bootlogd".

Compared to some other OS's, this is very simple.

I hope that at least sparks some conversation.

I REALLY don't think so.  Surely there's a kernel-level device hacker that
would know for sure (Galen, mebbe?), but I'd lay money on the idea that
the module locations are all handled by the modutils which are run by
init.

Think about it, the kernel doesn't even have to load filesystem drivers to
work.  It just takes the parameters handed to it by the boot loader.  Lilo
knows FA about filesystems.

> If the kernel needs a module to finish booting (say IDE for instance),

Now, that just seems like crazy talk.  It's a loopy Catch-22 kind of
thing.

If you need the IDE driver to load the rest of the system, you would also
need the filesystem driver.  I would think all that schnike had to be
handed over to the kernel in some explicit low-level form before
abstractions like the filesystem are addressed.

> From my understanding though, this is where an initrd image must be

I don't think it MUST.  I mean, isn't some of this what Lilo's System.map
is for?

Right... and initrd seems to be just one way to handle this sort of thing.

Well, you know, they have a good sense of humor and can be really sweet at
times.  You'd have to get to know them as well as the kernel does and they
just doesn't let others get that close.  I mean, I really don't think
you're in any position to pass judgment, really.

That's not just for LVM, of course.

I'm too tired to wax technical.

multiple versions is a pretty good reason.  it's not hard to do
objdir!=srcdir, and it makes multiple versions much easier.
there are many ways multiple versions are useful, such as
experimenting with optimization switches.

another reason is: for larger programs, dependencies are hard to
get right, and 'make clean' is also hard to get right.  so if you
use the same srcdir for multiple builds, you can end up with
problems that are difficult to reproduce.  it might happen
rarely, but it's a big waste of time when it does happen.

though now that disk space is so cheap, it's not that important
to get objdir!=srcdir builds right.  (just make a disposable copy
of srcdir for each build.)

(gcc is kind of a special case, because it has complex
interdependencies, since it's intended to bootstrap itself.  it's
possible that some bit of the build process doesn't work right

My view: Sulfuric Acid has more immediate effect.  Improperly obtained 
red meat, usually a bit more time.

More discussion about Jan. 1 being an unsuitable time for a Plug

------------------------------------------------

On Tuesday, January 6, 2004, Linus Torvalds will be 2^30 seconds
old.  Depending on time of day he was born on December 28, 1969
in Helsinki, + 3 hrs 37 minutes to PST.
 
On Saturday, January 10, 2004, at 0537PST the Epoch of Unix
(starting January 1, 1970 UTC) will be 2^30 seconds old.

These dates computed  with the aid of the Gigasecond Server at
http://www.araneus.fi/gigasecond/

--------------------------------------------------
Saturday nights at the Lab might be too busy, but a Tuesday would
be good.  Alternately, we could find another venue where BYOB would
be acceptable.  Ideas?  Or are we too proud to party?

FA is short for "fuck all" which is slang for "absolutely nothing".

Often, the phrase used is "sweet fuck all" or "sweet FA".

The comic strip IS in my house and the "foodstuff" is not.  But I might
say that the comic strip IS extremely dangerous to certain modes of
thought and ideas about society.  However, the strip doesn't give you
cancer.

Obtained, prepared, consumed... it's pretty dangerous all around.

Subject: [PLUG] Curiosity about adaptec 2940U2W
Message-ID: <1068935239.9412.15.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I have my card now and was able to plug in four out of my
five hard disks.  I'm curious what all the connectors are coming
out of it.  It has the internal 68 pin lvd connector, another
68 pin connector with a 50 pin connector below it, a connector
on the back of the card, and my 50 pin cable has yet another
connector that goes out the back of the case.  I couldn't plug
in my fifth hard disk because my ultra 2 cable only takes four.
Should I go ahead and try striping three with one as a backup?
Do I need five drives for raid?  The guy I got the card from 
said the ultra 2 cable is really expensive.  I could put the 
fifth hard disk in the safe for a spare.  All my hard disks 
are matched 4.3 gig ultra 2 fujitsu limiteds which identify 
as compaq drives.  They are a little on the small side, maybe 
I should just put one under /var, one under /usr, etc instead 
of trying to raid them together.  I'm wondering if the speed 
gain of striping verses putting the drives under different 
parts of the tree will be all that great?

I want to burn lots of 30 to 100 Meg uniquely named files to a CD on
different dates, filling the CD in a week. I believe that it's called
packet writing, like DirectCD does form Adaptec for that "other" OS.

It's for a backup routine that I'm using for a customer. I'm mounting a
Win PC's CD-R right now and just copying them over, but the intrinsic
Win instabilities are frustrating me. (I just drove for an hour one way
to un-jam the thing)

Is anybody doing this from their Linux box? If so, how?

Packet-writing is indeed nifty, if you want to treat a CD-RW as an
ordinary writable disc.  For your application, I think multisession is
more appropriate, and perhaps a bit simpler.  You're basically gonna be
using the -C and -M options with mkisofs.  The manpages should be a nice
starting point.

Urgh.  Ya know, cdrtools (mkisofs/cdrecord) is available in Win32, in
Cygwin and maybe native as well.  There are tools out there that make
supporting a Windows box merely twice as painful as a *nix box.

Good luck,

I am looking for advice/direction on how to set up traffic monitoring
graphs for a multi-interface linux box.  There are three ethernet
interfaces and an 802.11b card in the box, and one of the ethernet
interfaces has multiple IP's assigned.  I basically want to be able to
track bytes passed in/out of each IP.

What is the easiest way to do this.  SNMP is often mentioned, but: a)
I have no experience with it; and b) everything is local so I am not
sure I need it and since I don't know about it I rather not install it
if I don't have to.  Help?  Pointers?  Example configs?

I'm getting a lot of spam that isn't even addressed to me...  Anyone
else experiencing this?  I've stopped bouncing off of my server and
redirected to a mailbox I can look at with pine.  My hard drive was
running all day and I got sick and tired of that.  My spam is at
somewhere around 70% or higher on average.  

Has anyone tried locked addresses on all but one email address that
isn't a standard alias, then give out the special address to send an
email to to trusted friends?  This way I don't have to keep lists of
what to deny, just what to accept.  I would retain the ability to have
someone send me their email address via email so I can learn what it 
is.  We should have gone to no content accepted until you are
trusted systems a long time ago only accepting headers with null 
bodies.  I don't think a header can be more than offensive, I've 
yet to see a header alone be a virus or worm.

Y'all ever look at the mail headers? Your address is in there. Always.

MRTG + Apache + ucd-snmp (renamed to something, but I don't remember what).

The snmp package (on Debian, at least) comes with scripts to make it 
easy to set up. I got it running without any prior experience with snmp 
(in fact, I wouldn't say that I have any now).

Apache is fairly easy to set up.

MRTG is pretty complicated, but fortunately, it also has scripts that 
make it easy to set up.

Check the websites of the packages for details on the scripts... it's 
been a long time since I've done this...

There's no requirement in the current mail system that there be any 
relationship whatsoever between the visible header lines To:, Cc:, 
From:, etc. and the envelope info that actually has the destination.

Of the spam that gets past my first level blacklist filters, the 
proportion that doesn't have my email address in the To or CC lines has 
probably gone up the past few weeks;  though all for traditional spam, 
not the virus like msgs mentioned in this thread.

Another spam category that started (for me) in the last couple months is 
spam to you, that's forged like it came from you.  That further breaks 
down into two categories; msgs with just a mime separator and nothing 
else, and a complete spam msg.  From what I've seen on nanae, etc. the 
first category are probably probes the gangs use to try to guess whether 
their garbage will get through.

And (again at least for me) spam traffic has gone up considerably the 
last month or so.  Combining my blacklist logs and the garbage that gets 
past them to spamassassin, etc. I'm now running at 60-100 a week (plus 
whatever is caught by my isp).  Before that for many months it was more 
like 25-50 a week.

Sigh... eventually I may have to give up this public address; email 
addresses that are just your initials are too easy for the spammer gangs 
criminal dictionary attack, etc. tools to guess...

Do you have root and/or postmaster forwarded to your mailbox? If you do,
and you have unknown mail messages sent to root/postmaster, you'll get
every one of them.

All the time, but spamassassin catches 99% of the stuff that gets
through my postfix blocks.

Jeme is against this, since it tramples on some persons free speech, and
it goes against the free flow of bits. Or, at least, that's what I
understand. He'll pipe up if I'm wrong. 

As far as blocking stuff, I have the following stuff in my main.cf for
postfix:

smtpd_client_restrictions = hash:/etc/postfix/access,
        reject_rbl_client blackholes.easynet.nl,
        reject_rbl_client dynablock.easynet.nl,
        reject_rbl_client proxies.blackholes.easynet.nl,
        reject_rbl_client relays.ordb.org,
        reject_rbl_client sbl.spamhaus.org,
        reject_rbl_client zombie.dnsbl.sorbs.net,
        reject_rbl_client dnsbl.njabl.org,
        reject_rbl_client cbl.abuseat.org

smtpd_sender_restrictions = reject_rbl_client blackholes.easynet.nl,
        reject_rbl_client dynablock.easynet.nl,
        reject_rbl_client relays.ordb.org,
        reject_rbl_client proxies.blackholes.easynet.nl,
        reject_rbl_client sbl.spamhaus.org,
        reject_rbl_client zombie.dnsbl.sOrbs.net,
        reject_rbl_client dnsbl.njabl.org,
        reject_rbl_client cbl.abuseat.org
maps_rbl_reject_code = 571

My reject rate is between 50% an 60%. Sometimes, it spikes up to 80% and
I've see a high of 90%. That's what postfix rejects outright, based on
the lists above. 

After it gets past those lists, postfix hands it off to spamassassin.

Marvin,

  This started several weeks ago. I was getting several hundred a day; now
it's a couple of dozen. However, I see none of them; they're all rejected by
/etc/postfix/header_checks. Here's what I have there that're pertinent to
this dreck:

/^From: Net .*Service/                                  reject Rule H393
/^To: internet user/                                    reject Rule H394
/^From: .*Microsoft Internet Security/                  reject Rule H410
/^X-Mailer: Internet Mail Service/                      reject Rule H412
/^Subject: Current Network Security Upgrade/            reject Rule H414
/^From: MS Internet/                                    reject Rule H425
/^Subject: Bug Announcement/                            reject Rule H439
/^Subject: Bug Report/                                  reject Rule H441
/^To: "Mail User"/                                      reject Rule H442
/^Subject: .*New Microsoft Critical Pack/               reject Rule H445

  I know there are more sprinkled in there, but this will get you started. I
also reject all attachments that end in .exe, .pif and the others that are
Microsoft specific.

HTH,

Rich

  While we're on the subject, has anyone crafted a regex that accepts only

subject line where a "one" has been substituted for an "ell" or a "zero" for
an "oh"?

  As our MTA filters become more efficient the spammers mangle the words in
the subject; sometimes so effectively that not only does it make it past

  Sorry for the noise. I tried again and found such a list. I also learned
that on my Sony the vga= command needs to be on the kernel command line and
not separate. But, it works now.

The spammers are getting desperate. This is the subject line of a spam I

  Eggactly, Chuck. This is why I wonder if some clever person has come up
with a regex to identify words like this so they can be rejected.

  Could it be done with a combination of ~[A-Z,a-z,0-9]? Sometimes there is
legitimate punctuation in a subject line.

Never block based solely on the From: address. If we did this, I could
go around spamming thousands of people as "Michael C. Robinson" and
suddenly you couldn't send email to anybody. Something like Razor
(http://razor.sf.net/) is better for this kind of thing. (And
spamassassin will work together with Razor, given that it's all
configured correctly.)

I am not directly familiar with this, but I remember a Slashdot announcement

I wrote a short article on this a few weeks back:

http://panug.org/news/regex.html

Here's an example of a simple regular expression that catches many
of the common variants of viagra - including the misspelling "viagro"
that I sometimes get. The expression can get more complex to cover
more variants.

/^Subject:.*v[-_]*[il1!][-_]*a[-_]*g[-_]*r[-_]*[ao0]/    REJECT


Be careful about putting too many of these in your Postfix header
checks. Postfix will take a lot of time and start generating
timeout-related error messages. Check your logs to see if this
happens.

Not strictly a regex, but Bayesian filters work especially well with
words (or spellings) that you only find in spam.  I use Bogofilter, but
SpamAssassin's spamc/spamd work nicely, I'm told.

Means the filters are working.  When I check my spambox, I notice that
most of the messages contain gibberish, as well.  The actual message is
apparently contained in the many HTML-linked images that unwary email
clients auto-load when the message is opened.

KDE 3.1 has a few patches from Apple, but 3.2 will have considerably more.  
From what I've seen of the comments, it appears that Apple's changes are not 
being introduced wholesale, but are often rewritten, recorrected, or changed 
to better fit the codebase.  A few changes have been rejected because they 
break other things.

My understanding is that the dev teams are still converging with patches going 
both directions.  It'll probably be KDE 3.3 (or whatever comes next) before 
both sides are mostly caught up.

Best,
Kyle

That light is defined by standards to indicate mere presence of a
carrier, not necessarily a good link. We call it a link light, but it's
not quite that smart.

I installed SmoothWall 2.0 this weekend just to try it out. It has a
really great web interface and is easy to configure. You can setup
snort, web proxy and vpn in a couple of clicks, and it seems to work as
advertised. But... something about it makes me feel uneasy. I haven't
quite figured it out yet.

Anyway, it has traffic graph page that shows incoming, outgoing, and
forwarded traffic on each interface. You might could download and dig
into it, to see how they set it up.

Bzzt! Wrong answer! Thanks for being on our show...

I'm uncertain whether the kernel load files or simply data as modules,
but either way you can attempt to load any file anywhere into the kernel.
All the kernel cares about is that it is in the right format and has the
right symbols inside it. OTOH modprobe (but not insmod) looks in
/lib/modules/<kernver> for kernel modules to load.

You got this right. The boot loader uses the BIOS to load the initial ram
disk, and the right kernel driver (which skips the BIOS) can be loaded
from the initrd, which since it is already in memory can be accessed
without the driver already present in the kernel.

Wrong. The kernel has two paths for root device. First, it can get the
device major/minor directly specified. This specification in turn has two
paths, there is a value built into the kernel itself which `rdev` can
change, otherwise it can be passed on the kernel command line. Second,
once an initrd is loaded the "pivot_root" system call can be used to
specify an arbitrary FS as root (look at the kernel source,
linux/Documentation/initrd.txt for details). /etc/fstab has absolutly no
relevance to this process.

Wrong. With new style (autodetect) the RAID devices are specified on the
devices themselves. With the old style RAID devices the
_scripts/binaries_ look at /etc/raidtab to determine what devices to tell
the kernel what to load as RAID devices, but the kernel itself doesn't
care at all.

Correct. syslogd/klogd reads the buffer and dumps it wherever you want it
to.

Safari and Konq 3.2 appear to be considerably closer it seems, which is 
nice.  For those that are wondering I was able to get the 3.2 beta 1 
running VERY easily using "konstruct" ("cd kde/kdebase; make install"

Subject: [PLUG] file system layout question
Message-ID: <BAY9-F57iYc34SM4yEm0000937e@hotmail.com>

Dear all:

This is more of a question than problem.

We just bought a new PC at work and we had the manufacturer
installed Linux for us.  RH9.
EVerything is great.  One of the things that I notice and would be 
interested to know
why is the filesystem.  The box has 2 disk drive, one is 110G and
the other is 80GB.  'df -k' shows this:

Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda5            110610112   4578352 100413028   5% /
/dev/hda3               101107      9347     86539  10% /boot
none                    515200         0    515200   0% /dev/shm
/dev/vg01/lv_data     76876840     32828  72938888   1% /data

So I have 2 partitions on /dev/hda.  But the 2nd drive is mounted using LVM  
as a logical
volume, if I am not mistaken.  If I am correct on this, I would like to know 
why
it is being formatted this way?

thanks for any answer.

Vincent,

  I cannot address the logical volume question as I don't use 'em. But, a
number of pre-installed linuxes come with just a root directory (/) and
_everything_ is in there. Why? It's easier for them and their automatic
install scripts.

  EmperorLinux normally has / and /home. I asked nicely and they split
/usr/local into a separate partition for me. So on my new laptop I have /,
/usr/local, /home and swap. My preference for servers (and workstations that
function as servers, too) is to also split off /tmp and /var into separate
filesystems. Of course, for an automated installation script they will
probably not have the sizes any one purchaser wants so they roll it all into
one. Yuck!

Why?  This doesn't make much sense to me.

/home and /var are pretty sensible to keep on a separate partition if it's
a system that you don't monitor at all and you might run the risk of
filling up the filesystem.  (user disk quotas might remove the need to
split off /home, however.)

But why put /usr/local in a separate partition?  It's not like this is
1982 and we have wacky limitations on the number of addressable inodes in
a partition.

I might split off /var for the above-mentioned reasons and I usually mount
/home from a networked filesystem and /tmp from a memory-based system, but
other than that, I don't think there's much reason to partition everything
out like the old days.

I'm originally from Garden Grove, CA. Often the focus of negative news
reports -- Garden Grove is home to "Little Vietnam," which has in the
past erupted in some pretty horrific gang violence -- my home town
surprised me today. For some odd reason, I was poking around the
city's web site and found this very cool page:

There's a related online slide show:

  http://ch.ci.garden-grove.ca.us/internet/gbet/OpenSource.html

The bottom line is that the city manager estimates he saves about
$70,000.00 in direct costs each year, and more in indirect costs (less
paperwork, reduced security exposure, higher system stability, etc.).

Another reason for partitioning is in case a filesystem becomes corrupted
then only that partition is affected.

I'm pretty much got the same answers as Rich.
/ /boot /usr /var /home /opt /usr/local /data /tmp
are some of the popular partition names (I probably missed several)
Some of it's just helpful in organization.
On small systems such as my laptop, I just have my / & swap as two
partitions.  My server is split up a bit more, especially since I have
multiple drives.  Is it strictly nessasary? Not really, but having
partitions such as /usr/local & /home make it a lot easier to do a
reinstall when you can just leave those partitions alone without having to
backup & restore (backup is always advised)

I usually create /usr/local/Downloads/ and this can get quite large, 
sometimes it lives on a seperate drive altogether.

Plus for safety, you can unmount it so that nothing goes awry during an os 
upgrade.

  Now they need to replace the 600 winduhs machines and recalculate their

Subject: [PLUG] Free Firewall
Message-ID: <1069113306.27368.55.camel@einstein.seansdomain.org>

I have a firewall white box server that I built about three years ago
available for free.

It's running debian stable with a 2.2 kernel installed.  It's using
seawall (http://seawall.sourceforge.net/) for it's firewalling.

It has 4 interfaces

eth0 - inside
eth1 - outside
eth2 - dmz
eth3 - wireless

This setup is pretty standard with the exception of the wireless.  This
interface had a 802.11b access point on it and was set up like a normal
inside interface, except that the inside interface and wireless
interface can't talk to each other.  This effectively makes it a free
wireless node.

It's set up to support pppoe on eth1 but this could be modified to
support whatever broadband interface is needed.  It was set up to work
with Earthlink pppoe DSL.

The hardware is a 486x66 with 16MBs of memory, 4 ne2K nic cards (and I
have some extra ne2k cards I can through in as well), Buslogic BT-445S
scsi card, and a 500MB Quantum Maverick 540S hard drive.  Some people
might think that this is underpowered for a firewall, but the opposite
is true, it's greatly overpowered.  Most firewall's don't require much
in the way of CPU and memory.  Pushing packets isn't hard. 

This has been an extremely reliable working firewall.  Never compromised
(that I could tell *grin* ).  The only time if failed me was when I
first set it up.  I did a remote scan against the firewall to see what
vulnerabilities where there, and I filled up the only partition (big
mistake, now fixed) with syslog entries.  It now sends all logging to a
loghost.

I'm only replacing it for the following reasons:

1) I received a Sparc 10 dual proc computer.  This offers a smaller form
factor and fits on a shelf that I have.  It also has a nice qe card for
all the interfaces.
2) I wanted to upgrade the kernel to 2.4 to support iptables and ext3. 
This also required converting from seawall to shorewall firewall. 
Setting up a firewall can be difficult if the information you need to
make it work is on the Internet.  Settting up a different box made more
sense.

If anyone is interested they just need to send me an email and come and
pick it up in Vancouver.  First come, first serve.

x in the passwd file is a placeholder for the password that used to be
in this field.  Most unix/linux flavors now support /etc/shadow, which
has a better encryption method and limits who can look at the file.

the * or ! in the password field of shadow, means that the account is
locked, and no one can log into the account using a password.  You would
have to su from root to use the account.

Sometimes you will also see the password field in shadow using *LK*
(which is the same as *).  Any password can be disabled by putting a *
or a ! in front of the password.  Reenable the account with the old
password by removing the * or !.

There's a related online slide show:

  http://ch.ci.garden-grove.ca.us/internet/gbet/OpenSource.html

The bottom line is that the city manager estimates he saves about $70,000.00
in direct costs each year, and more in indirect costs (less paperwork,
reduced security exposure, higher system stability, etc.).

I would like to add a few additional disks to an existing harware RAID

things don't die, is it possible to resize the Linux partition to use the
new additional space?  Or do I need to copy the data elsewhere, rebuild
the filesystem at the larger size, and copy the data back?

Adding disks to the hardware RAID will only enlarge the virtual disk
size and does nothing to the existing partitioning.  You still have to
create a partition and make a file system.  The additional disk will
appear as unformatted disk.

Is it possible to grow the ext3 filesystem to fill the additional disk space?

  I am in new territory here and without a map. My new laptop has sound
capabilities and my "Thinking in Java" book has sound-and-light tutorials.
So I thought this would be a good test drive for the system. However, I had
a flat tire as I tried to pull out of the driveway.

  The tutorials run in a BUI (Browser User Interface). So I fired up mozilla
and opened the index.htm file on the cdrom. The cdrom file tells me it wants
the RealPlayer plug-in for mozilla. Being the accommodating fellow that I am
I told it to go ahead and grab a copy from wherever. The RealPlayer Web site
had only the luxury model with Corinthian leather seats and chrome all over.
I could not find the Yugo version.

  From my workstation I searched google and found the RealPlayer8 Yugo
version that had been prepared for the era of Red Hat 6.x. Downloaded that
and copied it across the network to the laptop. Thought I had installed it
-- it played a couple of notes for me -- but the tutorial didn't see it and
insisted on a RealPlayer plug-in.

  What am I supposed to do to figure out what's wrong? Better yet, how do I
get a working RealPlayer plug-in for mozilla?

TIA,

Rich

Find rpnp.so (during realplayer installation it may have gone

and copy it into one of the plugins directories for mozilla
/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins or ~/.mozilla/plugins

Use the resize2fs utility.  It can grow and shrink ext3 filesystems.
It is part of the e2fsprogs package.

Bill,

  Ah, so! Thank you.

  Now for the amusing end of this tale: I click on the "Intro Lecture"
button and mozilla instantly shuts down: gone! So, I try it again and this
time I hear an introduction (of a few seconds as a mp3.mac file), then
mozilla shuts down again.

  So, time to stop futzing and toss the cdrom. I prefer to read on the
processed carcasses of dead trees in any case.

Wow.  I've never seen a RAID controller that'll add discs to an existing
array without destroying the data.  The Adaptecs I used at my last job
wouldn't do this.  In your shoes, I'd plan the job assuming the data
will be destroyed and back it up before starting.  If I don't have to
restore, then the job's done sooner than expected.

Even if you think you don't have to, plan on doing that.  Have a viable,
tested backup, and enough downtime to use it.  Which is a good idea in
any case.  

Big fat IDE discs are cheap, compared to downtime and lost data.

You should investigate RAID5 on Solaris. It's specifically set up to
allow for this. As well as hot spares, and cold spares.

Hot/cold spares, sure.  Safely growing a RAID5 capacity-wise, however,
is not trivial.  It's a little easier on RAID4, which is one reason
NetApps use it.  I've heard rumors of one of the volume managers on
Linux supporting SW-RAID growth, but haven't verified or tested it.

And in any case, I was talking about commodity PC HW-RAID controllers on
Linux boxen, not Real Unix Stuff. ;)

You could go through CPAN, though by going through
http://search.cpan.org/~crein/Net-DNS-0.42/lib/Net/DNS.pm
I got http://www.net-dns.org
which says RPMS kindly made by Rob Brown
and from there we kind of crap out since they don't supply any non-RH
rpms.  However, there is the cpan2rpm tool.
So you could get the source, and roll your own.
Or perhaps someone can help you a bit more than my effort of scattering a
series of tools at you. :)

I wouldn't have set up the logical volume as the entire volume group,
myself. Logical volume management is a really nice way of letting you
shuffle around data and partitions to your hearts content, rather than
being limited to whatever fdisk limits you to. Moreover, you can resize
volumes (although only increasing them is safe if you have a filesystem
on there already; recommendation: use reiser) on the fly. Additionally,
you can add additional hard drives and volumes can be split across
hardware transparently.

It'd have to be the IBM stuff, as md and Sistina lvm don't support this.

Thanks Mark, Aaron.

That RPM was issued by SuSE as patch for their latest vers. 9. It is
required to install SpamAssassin from rpm. I don't think it is
hopelessly outdated. 

It'll be nice to find it and not having to build it.

Well, the RH RPMs are all over the Internet. Hard to beat that. And the
SuSE 9 RPMs are just not yet out there. Or maybe I'm looking at the
wrong places?

What do you have in mind for a course on regular expressions Ed?
If putting too many header checks in Postfix is a problem, I'd at 
least like to figure out how to post filter so that spammers who
use the same address can't hit me from there again for at least
a few days.  I would also like to filter suspected spam to
get rid of definite spam automatically.  Spam assassin is marking
a lot of it, how can I trim my spam folder of anything that is
marked forged outlook express, etc?  With the definite spam 
dumped instead of merely marked as suspect, I'd only have to 
look at questionable stuff that has a real chance of being 
legit.  My sense is that email advertisers need to be forced 
one way or another to legitimately identify who they are.  Ads 
should be opt-in instead of opt-out for direct mail channels.  
Maybe a new email standard is needed that takes into account 
people who own email servers needing to control what goes out and 
comes in producing few false positives.

Email isn't television where you pay for time, it's someone 
else's property where that someone isn't paid.  Unfortunately, 
I even find television discouraging these days.   It has been
taken over by large national networks with seemingly no 
scruples.  Content that I once thought would be rated X or 
worse can be seen on some ordinary airwave stations now, 
UPN 49 for example.  There was a time you either had to go 
somewhere or buy cable/satellite for that. These days, I run 
into radio ads pushing reality sex on free television stations.

The Internet is just being abused as an extension of sex on TV 
it seems.  Viagra is probably just the tip of the iceberg,
a drug that very few men really need which is in fact dangerous
to those who don't need it.  Maybe the television networks are 
desperate and out of desperation choose to turn the audience 
into addicts instead of introducing better drama.  I guess 
entertainment isn't considered a worthwhile risk anymore.  

My real concern is that the targets are loose values boomers. 
That's pretty disgusting if it's true.  I also worry about
who is after money on the fringe, how do we know terrorists 
aren't taking advantage of the Reality TV craze to get access 
to credit?  It's a smart way to do it, how can anyone
trying this get caught?  Are terrorist assets really frozen?
Maybe terrorists will make money off a sub culture that has
been gaining strength in this country?  Why has hardcore sex
over the past few years become alarmingly visible?  Not only
is it visible online, there are paid television shows. There 
is also a sex shop near PSU and the high school that's right 
behind it.  I noticed one close to OSU driving home 
after seeing an old friend.  It's slipping into every kind
of venue physical and virtual it seems.

As much as it's helpful to catch the Viagra Ads, I think
the public needs to wake up and shut down the growing
trend towards sex everywhere all the time.  It's time
to contact legislator's, write letters to the television
stations, and perhaps even picket at City Halls to get
adult stores closed.  No adult sex shop has any business 
being anywhere, least of all near high schools and 
Universities.  I see this as the next major problem
after tobacco, and to think that our favorite technologies 
are probably at the center of delivering pornography, etc.
The sooner reality TV dies, the less of a problem Viagra 
ads etc. are going to continue to pose.  Somebody is 
sponsoring this, the greatest public weapon is taking 
away the lucrativeness of the sex businesses bankrupting
that sponsor.

  I don't, Kris. But, I have an AdvantSys SCSI card (USB-3940) I don't need.
I'll sell that very inexpensively to anyone who could use it.

will determine which disk in the raid set got changed and repair it?  
If there is no damage, can I mark the raid partitions as clean?  
Don't I have three copies of the data?  I would think use rpm verify,
but that always fails on certain files because there are normal
changes that happen.

Both raid partitions mount okay and are probably fine.  
Does Redhat have to mark a raid as clean after every reboot?  
Some commands are lost including it seems the raid ones 
when /usr is down, maybe I need to move the raid tools
to /sbin.

I'm mostly wondering what happened.  I don't expect raid failure
just because I booted up once with a non raid enabled kernel.
It's a simple mistake to make, this is the first time I've ever
done raid so I just plain forget compiling a 2.4.22 kernel to 
enable raid.  Now that they mounted, I wonder if rebooting will
cause the init scripts to record that the raid is okay.

Last I heard, XFS and Reiser were the ones to go with if you are dealing
with a database, one being faster for many small files, the other being
faster for few large files - I *think* it was Reiser being faster for
large files and XFS being faster for small files....

But, that was a while ago I read that...

Google probably knows more than I on the subject.  Look for some
comparison articles or something, like on Linux websites.

Alan,

    I will contact VMWare and get us all signed up to participate in
this.  Let you know as soon as it is done.

    By the way, our group is suppose to be listed at both
http://lugww.counter.li.org/ and http://www.ssc.com:8080/glue/groups/
as well as http://www.linux.org and else where.  Since we need to be
listed at one of these sites to participate in the program, I looked
at the sites - mostly to make sure the contact information was up to
date.  Guess what?  We had been completely removed from the SSC site
and replaced by the pdxLUG group!!!  This is despite of fact, that
we were a founding and dues paying (ok - trivial amount) member of GLUE.


                                          Sincerely,

Subject: [PLUG] My new wireless card...
Message-ID: <1069208551.32456.315.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I have an SMC EZ Connect card with a PCI to pcmcia adapter.
I thought for the price I might pick up another wireless
card if this one isn't supported.  This thing doesn't 
have an external antenna connector I can spot.  I'm 
wondering what the range etc. on it is?  I doubt it's 
something I can hook up to a coffee can antenna which
I'll need to do if I'm going to go eight miles.  One
thing I'm concerned about is what the transmission
power will cost compared to just buying another
phone line.  Well there's that concern and how fast
the coffee cans will rust out.  I'll also need to look
into making them appealing to people who will see them.

Climbing a tree, a tower can be spotted that's within
half a mile of where I want to beam to.  I don't know 
if that's close enough though.  Short of getting a 
gps unit, I wonder what I'm looking at being at about 
50 feet with a tree to use that goes up at least 
another 50 feet above sea level.  The target is 
along the road that goes between the new Burgerville 
and Winsum Staffing in St. Helens.  It's quite a ways 
from roughly where the Scappoose Fred Meyers is.  
It's a shorter distance than the O'Reilly long shot. 
In my example, my short distance is longer 
than O'Reilly's.  They had a radio tower though.  
Even if I connect two isolated machines over this 
distance with 802.11b or better, I have to add 
strong encryption.  If I lose 50% of the speed or 
even 75% of the optimal 11 mbps speed, I'm still 
beating a second phoneline and dial up server
at $23-$32 a month.

One concern I have is a sticker that said don't take the 
card out of the pcmcia adapter.  I hope this is standard 
pcmcia.  I'm after that as much as a chance to play with 
wireless.  It says it's model SMC2632W on the card front, 
but on the back I see SMC2602W under a long bar code.  
It's supposed to be 802.11b. compliant.  Is there any 
way to alter this card so that it can take an external 
antenna?

If this card doesn't work, maybe I can pick up a prism.
The adapter card has an asic that says PLX Technology
PCI9052 S 0052 T2B BR2129.1 TAIWAN.  I can't read the
other asics or they're blank.

Well, I'll see if I can get this recognized. 
The next thing will be to get a second WiFi
card and attempt a peer to peer link :-)

hello there all.  First I hope you are all enjoying these lovely days.
 I'm sure we have all been missing the rain.

So, I'm confused about an email problem and trying to narrow down
where the error my exist.

>From aracnet I can not receive email on one of my domains.  It works
fine for many of the other domains just not one.  I have reviewed my
server settings and I can't seem to find out why.

Another odd thing is that the email is never delivered or bounced
back. It goes out into the ether never to be seen again.

Suggestions?  I have postfix running.

It may not be postfix but a firewall or something.

With large files, the performance differences are AFAIK mostly trivial,
so use what you like.  Look for something expandible.  Better to spend
your time choosing a good Logical Volume Manager.  Live storage
expansion and volume snapshots are lovely things to have on your
database servers.

Check for info on the database you're using.  Oracle, for instance, has
lots of info on disk layout and suchlike, and I'm sure you can find
plenty of discussions of this topic for MySQL and PostGres.

So has anyone ever had a nice cup of coffee with the PDXLUG people to
work this whole name thing out?  I recall that back in July something
like that was proposed.

They are currently saying:

  ``We've had many people ask why another group spawned from PLUG. The
    main reason is because we wanted a more informal gathering with a
    smaller group of people. [...]''

Now, if that is true, why choose an all-encompassing name like
"Portland Linux User Group"?  Ignoring for a moment the fact that
their mailing list is mostly moribund, isn't a name like that apt to
attract people in droves?  Is this, indeed, declaring victory on the
basis of whatever situation is prevailing? ("we _WANT_ a smaller
group!")

In response to David's message, on the pdxlug.org mailing list Matt
King says:

  ``hahahahahaha you suck''

Sounds like a DNS problem.  Does Aracnet's DNS resolve the domain

Subject: [PLUG] Looking for a web based Postfix/virtual account manager
Message-ID: <1069232986.15665.35.camel@halo>

Here is the Open Source Song from today. 

I was looking for a web based administrator tool we can give a client
who wants to maintain their email accounts themselves (? la web hosting
control panel). This is for a Postfix/Mysql (or LDAP)/virtual
domain/virtual account configuration. 

At Sourceforge, I found 60 projects that have not yet committed any
source. Too young, or never materialized. Then there were 6 others who
had code but can be considered dead. Most of these projects are ISP
admin tools. 

After scanning dozens of these dead projects I read this here on
http://mojo.sourceforge.net/:

"[...] Now go on over to the project page, and have a look and then
laugh and laugh and laugh. [...]" -- yeah, that is the right attitude!

The free tool I liked best didn't seem to like Postfix (i.e. the
Squirrelmail plug-in). 

The list of links and projects is below. The numbers at the begin of
some lines are quickly assigned (and possibly unjustified) ratings (with
1=very good, 5=bad). 

If any of you know of a good and free web based control panel, please
give me a holler. 

Thanks

Holger,

I use webmin or all remote admin of the server.  They have a side
project that will do what you like.  In fact, I'm set to configure it
as well.

It is called:  virtualmin.  Currently located here:
http://www.webmin.com/index8.html

It is under randsomware.  You'll have to read up on that but it is
funny.  Seems like the best choice for 'free' software.

Also, there was another project called: ispman
http://www.ispman.org/

That should also give you the abilities you seek.

Josh

Sorry for the late notice.  Everyone has been busy.


D. Cooper Stevenson will give a presentation on Antivirus solution for
Linux he designed for a client at Jax 826 SW 2nd Ave, Portland OR. Jax
is on the MAX Line, next to Bally's Fitness. 

His implementation is a filter built out of Open Source tools that
include Postfix, SpamAssassin, Amavisd, and clamav. He reports that the
client he developed this for is very happy with this solution. 

The meeting time will be 7:00pm, and will run until we either run out of

  Nah. It just hastens the journey of the wet leaves from my yard toward the
end of the block. This is balmy. And, it's been more than 5 years since the
ice was thick enough on the roads that driving down 238th was an adventure
in avoiding power poles and the steep drop-off to the right.

  What does blow me away is the fatuously immature attitudes expressed by
some on the alternative list who supposedly wanted a more focused mail list
without the off-topic rants and threads. Unfortunately, they failed at that,
too. Little minds in little people.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0311190649550.8967@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I'm probably the last to discover this, but I learned last evening that
some colors which display properly in a virtual terminal under X will not
display on a console. This comes from the "I Didn't Know That Department".

  When I slog through the conversion of my reference library to RIS format
using emacs while X is running, the text colors are wheat, light blue and
yellow. When I fired up emacs last evening on a console the colors were dark
red and dark blue. The buffer's text properties were still set for the
desired colors, but the monitor apparently cannot display them.

  How interesting!

PDXLUG has coffee the second Thursday of each month at the Fireside
Coffee Lodge.  There aren't any formal agendas, so if you show up, feel
free to bring up a topic for discussion.  

Not that bringing up the name thing is likely to accomplish much. :-)  

Open source has a long history of using names that are intentionally
similar to established names.  If people can be expected to understand
the difference between PGP and GPG, I think they can sort out the
difference between PDXLUG and PLUG.  

Or maybe they can't tell the difference.  It might be the case that our
membership consists primarily of people who mistakenly believe that PLUG
meetings have recently changed venues and become more fun.  Who knows.

PLUG isn't what many of us want for a LUG.  Others of us enjoy that
there is more than one style of LUG in town.  The rest is historic.

Because we are a group of Linux users in Portland.  We aren't Portland's

Our broader mission doesn't need to stand up to logic... we don't *have*
a broader mission.  What we *do* have is a user group we actually enjoy
belonging to.  No additional victory is required.

I've seen reports and tests that show that ReiserFS is not the best for very 
large files (DB files usually fall into this category).  XFS and JFS were the 
best if I remember correctly.  XFS is a little problematic with the 2.4 
kernels still as I don't think it is included in the vanilla kernel source 
yet.

The MySQL folks said that ext3 with data journalling on is quite fast and has 
really good recovery characteristics in the event of system crashes.  Use 
appropriately RAID-ed disks and I doubt the filesystem will usually be the 
bottleneck.

Later versions of Reiser have write barriers and data ordering.  This slows 
performance slightly, but increases the likelyhood that your data won't be 
chop suey after a crash.

If you are using MySQL, the main mailing list for the project has a number of 
extremely well informed people on it who will help answer questions.  I've 
had responses directly from Jeremey Zawodny (sp?) who runs Yahoo's business 
site DBs (all MySQL on biggish hardware) and Paul DuBois (author of the 
excellent "MySQL" book) as well as Monty, Sacha and some of the other core 
developers.  The Postgres mailing list isn't bad, but my experiences with it 
have been quite different from those of the MySQL list.

I've found that Postgres inability to guarantee coherent disk data while it is 
running (according to the manual) makes snapshots a lot more difficult with 
systems that must be up 24/7.  MySQL can do this (LOCK ALL TABLES; FLUSH 
TABLES; do LVM snapshot; UNLOCK TABLES) very quickly and is a rediculously 
easy way to do snapshots for backup or slave system creation.  LVM makes this 
really simple.

I would not do a DB installation without LVM/EVMS and RAIDed drives.

Best,
Kyle

You are right, this looks promising. I'll give it a shot. I have come to
like webmin some time ago. Should have looked there first.

Did he develop this independently or just follow this how-to:

I just used that how-to and it worked perfectly dandily.  (I changed a few

How will you decide what is "accomplished"?  Who is "you"?  Does
everyone who shows up get to vote?

Everyone I talk to about this issue says, "geez, are they such losers
that they can't make their _own_ reputation instead of sponging off
the work of others".

Once again, for the umpteenth time, no one in PLUG particularly cares
that you have a _different_ group.  Great!  Have your different group!
Have "fun" [1]!  The only issue is the fact that you chose a confusing
name.  I know it's confusing because every newbie I talk to, I warn
that there are two groups, one different from PLUG that calls itself
the Portland Linux User Group.  They are uniformily amazed.  Even your
own members chortle about it as if it's a joke.  What more evidence do
you need?

[1] Can you explain what you mean by "fun"?  I have fun at PLUG
    meetings.  I mean, do you play "Twister" or something?  At least
    at PLUG meetings, babes with tongue studs show up.  Do babes with
    tongue studs show up at PDXLUG meetings?

    Or is it a case of younger folks feeling excluded from the Lucky
    Lab social hour?  I have _never_ heard that expressed, but it is
    plausible.  Maybe a better name would be Junior PLUG or PLUG, Jr.?

Babes? No one said anything about "babes' at PLUG meetings. I'm convinced.

PDXLUG prefers to not seperate genders at meetings as into geeks and 
babes. We have piercings, but we don't care if they're a male or female.

Why are we rehashing this? What is the debate? Why are we cross posting 
lists? I don't feel that PLUG subscribers and/or PDXLUG subscribers 
should get these emails...let alone this email.

cheers,

Robby

I only saw one woman at the last PLUG meeting, and she didn't look, to
me, like she would have had a tongue stud... although I could be wrong
there.  :-)

Or maybe she was at the Lucky Lab?  By the time the PLUG meeting is
over, I'm so tired it's all I can do to drive home.

This does raise the question, though... do 'babes with tongue studs'
make meetings more fun?

Ok... but are there babes at PDXLUG meetings??

I found it quite interesting there was only one woman this month, for
what... maybe 75 men?... at the meeting.

For the record, "babe" isn't ALWAYS a woman.

(...though, in this case, she was.)

Right, she didn't show up until later.  She was with me.

Are you 90 or something?

I kinda thought you were the young guy I sat near when I came in late...

Yes.  Dear lord, yes.

Our last meeting, we had almost 20 people and 2 of them were 
'females'... I don't know if they'd appreciate being referred to as 
anything other than just that.

True.  But Doughnut took his tongue-stud out.

That doesn't answer the question at all, then.

But you're saying that the females that were there wouldn't appreciate
being referenced as ANYTHING but 'females'?  In any context?  That's an
extremely limiting view and I think you should probably discuss such a
thing with them before you go so far as to speak for them.

If it's true, it's shockingly unfun.

You can make up subcategories of people based on all kinds of things;
gender, height, relative physical appeal, volume of voice, girth,
whatever...  And naming those subcategories just improves communication.

Calling all females "babes" is surely insulting as it's a diminutive (like
"baby"), but using that term for all people you find physically sexy is
something else entirely and not necessarily degrading.

I took Russell to mean "sexy folks" when he wrote "babes".  If you took it
to mean "females", maybe you should reconsider your own perception of
women, not Russell's.

This is not atypical for technical groups generally or LUGs specificially.

It's sad, but not atypical.

This is definitely one advantage of smaller groups as minorities feel less
like a minority.  1 in 5 is a full 20 percent as 1 in 50 is just 2
percent.  I mean to say that an already established group that is
predominantly of one category (male, female, white, orange, etc.) will
have a hard time altering that in the long run because the intrepid
initiates from outside that class could feel out of place if they notice
their minority status.

Anyway, I've tried to break that in small ways.  I've probably brought
four or five women to PLUG social hours (though never more than one on the
same night).

Accomplishment is determined by the person with the agenda.  I leave it

You actually go around *talking* to people about this?  People who
actually say "geez"?  

All I can say about *that* is be careful who you're calling a loser. :-)

I'm sure your "babe" members are delighted to know how amusing you find
them.  Honestly, if you have to go to a Linux meeting to catch a glace
at someone attractive, it's time to get out more.

Not that the smugness of certain PLUG members has anything to do with

I almost wrote something sarcastic and insulting here because that's the
kind of response insulting sarcasm naturally induces.

Is it possible for you to address things directly, with sincerity, and
without the glib, back-handed attempts at wit?

We're trying to discuss an issue here and you're just slinging juvenile
retorts.

It has come up several times in discussion with newbies at the PLUG
clinic who are looking for information about PLUG meetings or the PLUG
mailing lists.  Since a naive google search might lead them to some
unrelated group, I make a point of warning them that there are two
similarly named groups.  I also make a point of not saying anything
disparaging about PDXLUG, because outside of the intransigence on the
name issue, I don't have anything disparaging to say.

Russell> The only issue is the fact that you chose a confusing name.

Dylan> And, as I said, confusing names are par for the course in OSS.

There isn't anything confusing about any of the examples you cited.
There _is_ something confusing about the distinction between PLUG and
a group calling itself the Portland Linux User Group.  Why do you
refuse to "deal" with that?

Only the Lucky Lab (I'd call it a pub, really) social hour is allegedly
off-limits to minors.  The PLUG meeting proper, the clinic and the
advanced topics meeting are open to minors.  It is unfortunate that
minors are dissuaded from attending the social hour.

Well, maybe on one of the mailing lists where such discussions take
place?  If people are feeling excluded because of the Lab, please
speak up.  Maybe if the problem becomes more apparent, a solution will
follow.

Subject: [PLUG] iptables Config' File
Message-ID: <20031119144638.1633d846.jason@vancleve.com>

Quick question on iptables, which I'm finally getting around to setting up on my laptop.  I'd like to create a more or less permanent and reusable configuration file, one I can modify for use on other machines.  I've heard of many people writing explicit scripts to configure the filter (iptables -b blah-blah; iptables -blah; . . .), but I also notice that iptables-save creates a formatted config' instead of actual iptables commands.

Is it wise to just use that formatted output as a portable config' file?  That is, to SCP it to another machine and load it there with iptables-restore (even just as a starting point)?  Maybe it would be better to write a script, so that I can compare it with other people's; but my distro' is set up to use iptables-restore at boot time, so maintaining a script could be awkward.

I need a recommendation for an IT consultant for a mixed

Just for the edification of folks.

the java plugin must be a link, not copied.

Found that out the hard way.....

I assume it some silly linking via .. or something.

So we will move Cooper's talk to January.

Is it that bad up there?

Down here in St. Paul it's just raining on and off now, with the
temerpature around 40 degrees.

We didn't get *any* sticking snow at all, and the weather report just
has rain in our future.

I can't imagine there's any ice on the ground.  There's a bit of slush.

The rain stuck to everything that wasn't paved (which, unfortunately,
isn't much).  I don't think I'll have any trouble navigating the roads by
bicycle.

Rob,

  No, it's not at all bad up here. Just a layer of _very_ wet snow. It's
melting and the traffic lanes have squshed it into water.

  You're too far south for snow.

I just converted from running
sendmail+amavis(f-secure)+cyrus+procmail+spamassassin to
postfix(postgresql)+amavis-new(f-secure/spamassassin)+cyrus(postgres)+sieve

I manage the accounts with web-cyradm (http://www.web-cyradm.org/)

I manage sieve with smartsieve (http://smartsieve.sourceforge.net)

web-cyradm has two howto's for setting up everything via postgres or
mysql.  They are really complete.

My biggest concern is relying on a DB for mail.  In other words. If the
DB goes down, mail state may be indeterminate.

But the differences are:

postfix vs. sendmail:  I like postfix much more now.  It has all the new
features I need (SSL, AUTH, etc.).  Security is a concern for some for
sendmail, and postfix's model is better, but it is just simpler to get
working.

Amavis-new (not amavis) calls spamassassin.  I am not sure I like this
for one reasons, amavis-new times out the SA call when things like razor
check takes too long.  I may change this.  Otherwise all mail gets
scanned for virus and spam centrally.  Before I used procmail to call
SA.  There are hooks in amavis-new's conf file for per user behavior.

cyrus is upgraded which is good.

sieve replaces procmail for filtering.  sieve is not as well documented,
or as powerful, but cyrus holds all mail under a "cyrus" account and
adding procmail per user is a security hazard.  Now sieve handles the
filters per mail user, but as user cyrus.  This means no external call
outs, but I stopped doing that :)  websieve allows users to setup
vacation messages and other standard scripts.

Postgres maintains the domains and accounts for postfix and cyrus.  This
means the web based program can add virtual mail domains, and added mail
account per domain.  Furthermore you can have domain admins vs super
admin, so if you want a user to control all mail to an admin, there you
go.

I run the web based stuff under ssl.



So far my moderately complex procmail recipies are working.  I have one
which is not.

The only thing left is to figure out unix_notify under cyrus to get IM
message everytime I get a mail to my inbox.....


Oh and now evolution show emails as read in my INBOX.  Damn
government....

We're not *that* far south.  I can be in Wilsonville in 20 minutes...
right up I-5.

As the crow flies, I think I'm only about 20 miles south of Portland.

We did have snow today, it just didn't stick.

It snows here about as often as it does in Downtown Portland, we're
right about at the same altitude.  :-)

In Lake Oswego, where I tend to get more snow than others, I have 2
inches of very wet snow that is leaving ice prints when I walk on it.  A
few calls around the area showed similar icy results.

There are some big trees down in the neighborhood.

I am pretty concerned that by the time AT gets out, there will be
black/sheet ice in random points of the city.

Those that want to go and meet, please do.  Supporting JAX would be nice
(they have been good to us), and meeting is a good thing in general.

A sincere, honest discussion would be great, but largely pointless. 
Near as I can tell, PDXLUG has no intention of changing its name.  Sorry

I wonder if you have a straight face... or really any face other than the
wishfully-ironic smirk.

...only if you've made up your mind before coming into it.

And why would that be?  Is there a REASON the name cannot be changed?

What we're all seeing is a whole bunch of nonsense and confusion that
could easily be avoided.  Really, the only reason I can see for keeping
(or, in fact, choosing) the name is to be intentionally confusing and
cause frustration... perhaps it's for amusement or perhaps it's for spite.
Whichever the motivation, it's juvenile, anti-social, and rude.

What goal is accomplished by maintaining the situation as it stands for
your tiny membership versus the good to the greater world?

> Sorry to offend you by attempting to find the humor in the situation.

You weren't trying to find humor in the situation, you were trying to find
humor in mocking other people.  The situation was avoided as much as
possible.

Ok, I know this is an old thread but this is what I have found.

I was looking at what was being used to display the images on the bootup
of knoppix and morphix because I want something like that in my stuff.
They use isolinux but my searches also found the stuff below.

copied from:
http://linux01.gwdg.de/suse/ftp.suse.com/people/stepan/bootsplash/themes/README.bootSplashMaker
***************
bootSplashMaker is a utility to create bootsplash themes, as they can
be used with SuSE Linux 8.1, UL1, SLES8 etc.
It should be easy to change the code to provide Mandrake compliant output
as well.
This code is very experimental, don't expect much to be there.
You can load/import a set of pictures, and provide a comment, select the
text window in a picture and write out a theme directory.

Requirements:
 * perl
 * perl-Tk
 * perl-Class-MethodMaker
 * ImageMagick

installation:
  chmod 755 bootSplashMaker
  mkdir ~/bootsplash-themes
  export bSM_WORK=~/bootsplash-themes

  then execute
  ./bootSplashMaker

Change the Theme Name, then add several pictures and change the comment to
fit
your needs. Every comment line needs to start with a #

When you save a theme, copy the resulting directory to
/usr/share/splash/themes
and change /etc/sysconfig/bootsplash to use your freshly created theme.
Then run

# SuSEconfig --module bootsplash
# mk_initrd

If you use lilo for booting, you have to rerun the "lilo" program in order
to make lilo recognize your new initrd containing the pictures.

Known Bugs:
The text and bg color are not written correctly. change them according to
your needs manually
Saving to a tgz does not work yet

Contact:
Program written by RayMan <foobar at web.de>.
bootsplash kernel patch written by Stefan Reinauer <stepan at suse.de>
************endcopy

Double check to see if you have a /bootthemes directory and what it
contains.
If there is one there then the kernel has been patch with bootsplash.

Right... that seems to be the only reason you guys are putting up such a
fuss.

So let's add to the running list:
intentional confusion (mocking or spiteful)
pride

Got anything else?  Perhaps something that mature people might understand?

I saw web-cyradm but it really also needs smartsieve to go with. Will

No one is pushing you anywhere, so please lose the paranoid delusions.

The problem remains that you took PLUG's name.  I'd wager, except
during the times this subject comes up again (and again), most PLUG
members would probably tell you that PLUG stands for Portland Linux
User Group.  As I understand it, the Linux/Unix thing only came about
as an effort to be inclusive of another group (the Portland Unix Users
Group[1]).  As near as I can tell, the Linux/Unix thing has never
really caught on very strongly with the "rank-and-file".  Check Google
Groups for common usage.[2]

If you want to be different then choose a "different" name (hint: it
isn't different now).  If you want to be the same then let's work
together again.  If you have differences, the rational thing to do is
to discuss them.  If you think this issue is going to go away by
ignoring it, you are wrong.  Everytime I find evidence of
confusion[3], I am going to bring it up again.


[1] I have some old puug mailing list traffic from the period shortly
    after PLUG formed.  Also, see the November 1994 meeting announcement: 
       Message-ID: <ROGERC.94Nov12150438 at sirius.cs.pdx.edu>

[2] <http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22Portland+Linux+User+Group%22&scoring=d>

[3] like when organizations de-list PLUG apparently thinking PDXLUG is
    the same thing, or some kind of successor; or when newbies are
    flabbergasted to discover that people claiming to be the Portland
    Linux User Group aren't PLUG.

Jason, 

fwiw, I have an /etc/iptables that is a script beginning with 
	#!/bin/sh 
	/sbin/iptables bla bla bla
	...
and ending with 
	/etc/init.d/iptables save

So on startup, it loads the formatted config. This also seemed like an
easy way to update/test new configs just by running the script as
necessary. 

The formatted config file seemed weird to me - a noticable difference
from ipchains - so this was my quick fix. It should also make for a
maintainable a portable configuration. 

hope this helps,
sasha

The disk files should be coherent at every point in time as long as the 
log files are included.  Otherwise, the database couldn't be restored 
when the machine crashes.  It only works with an instantaneous snapshot 
but LVM provides that.

The pg_dump backup is smaller than the live database and makes a much

From the manual, you cannot take a snapshot of the files used by the DB while 
it is live.  MySQL can do this.  Because the manuals say this, I would assume 
that something is in memory that isn't on disk.  Clearly this something can 
be recreated (or rolled back) because Postgres can recover from crashes.  If 
my snapshot isn't a completely safe and coherent set of data, it isn't a 
snapshot.

Can pg_dump be run safely and without performance degredation on a live 
Postgres DB?

Subject: [PLUG] DOE Releases Blackout Report
Message-ID: <1069305390.5104.100.camel@pookie>

Dear Friends,

The Department of Energy released today their report outlining the
causes behind the August 14th electrical blackout that left an estimated
50 million people without power for two days in some areas. You may view
the full report here:

  https://reports.energy.gov/


On page 22, the report gives us the first glimpse of the two primary
reasons for the blackout:

"Subsequent computer failures leading to the loss of situational
awareness in FE's control room and the loss of FE transmission lines due
to contacts with trees were the most important causes."

The task force reveals more details on page 28:

"Starting around 14:14 EDT, FE's control room operators lost the alarm
function that audible and visual indications when a significant piece of
equipment changed from an acceptable to problematic condition. Shortly
thereafter, the EMS system lost a number of its remote control consoles.

Next it lost the primary server computer that was hosting the alarm
function, and then the backup server such that all functions that were
being supported on these servers were stopped at 14:54 EDT."

Translation:

The alarm PC's in the control room were under a denial of service attack
caused by the "Blaster" worm. They probably looked to the user as if
they were running normally as DDOS attacks primarily target the
networking subsystem in these "corner" monitoring stations.

As the worm spread, it infects and overloads the Primary Domain
Controller (signified as the "primary server computer" in the report)
and causes it to either crash or experience an overloaded network
subsystem. The Secondary Domain Controller also either crashes or is
also incapable of communicating on the network as the worm exacts it's
payload. 

The PDC further running the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA). It is this application that is responsible for grid monitoring
and sending alarm notices to the monitor terminals.

So it is becoming clear that the blackout of last summer was caused by a
Microsoft security flaw. If you're not convinced, consider the report's
hinting about this on page 94:
 
"Many malicious code attacks, by their very nature, are unbiased and
tend to interfere with operations supported by vulnerable applications.
One such incident occurred on January 2003, when the "Slammer" Internet
worm took down monitoring computers at FirstEnergy Corporation's idled
Davis-Besse nuclear plant. A subsequent report by the North American
Electric Reliability Council (NERC) concluded that, although it caused
no outages, the infection blocked command that operated other power
utilities."

If you're still in doubt, here's the ComputerWeek article outlining the
Blaster worm's role in the blackout shortly after it happened:

http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/recovery/story/0,10801,84510,00.html

Ironically, the worm even delayed New York's restoration of power:

"A former Bush administration adviser who has consulted with the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security on the power grid issue said the Blaster
worm also hampered the ability of utilities in the New York region to
restore power in a more timely manner because some of those companies
were running Windows-based control systems with Port 135 open - the port
through which the worm attacked systems."

This is an outrage. What are the officials operating the power grid
doing running mission-critical alarm control systems on a platform known
for serious security issues?


Very Truly Yours,

Interesting solution, but wouldn't your script need to delete the old tables before adding them again?  If you took a line out of it, you'd want that rule to go away when you ran the script, yeah?

That's nothing.  Used to be that aircraft jetliners ran un*x because of its 
robustness.  Read a few years ago that they switched to NT.  I haven't 
researched this much, so I could be talking out my ass.  If so put me in the 
knee-jerk ms-bashing camp.  But it's probably true and you know that all of 
ms's billions are not just sitting in the bank, they're going into pockets.

We know redmond's os has left battleships dead in the water.  Arugably more 
mission-critical than the power grid.

Perhaps some can research this better.

Since it's such a common mistake to use that OS, I'm more outraged that 
they chose to use unpatched systems for such critical infrastructure. 
I'm only an okay sysadmin, and none of my systems are that unpatched, 
and I'm only dealing with businesses in the millions.

aka "gating items".

Idle curiosity, but let's say one is evaluating various linux distros and 
one seems less responsive (at least under X) than another.

Is there a way (toolset?) to determine that the sluggishness is due to 
kernel compile options, a different glibc, video driver, or whatever.

It's easy to create comparative metrics between systems, but can the problem 
be identified aside from transplanting kernels, libs, whatever?

Maybe a system that could tell you how to make itself better is still in the

Sorry if this interrupts the nice p1551ng match over the P[DX]LUG
names.  But I was looking over the PLUG (our PLUG) website, and ran
across the FAQ.  As I read the general stuff on Linux, I had the
impression that a newbie knowing nothing about Linux would get the
idea that Linux is all the work of the GNU project, with this little
"kernel" think that Linus stuck on to complete the package.

It seems that this gives GNU way too much credit.  My understanding of
the history of Linux is that Torvalds used whatever was out there that
seemed useful, including many components written by people not
directly involved with the GNU project, other than that they GPL'd
their code.  At least by the time I started playing with Linux, it was
already at the stage where Xfree86 was considered an integral part of
Linux.  (Was Xfree86 a GNU or FSF project?)

I saw a study cited on /. a few years ago, during one of the monthly
Linux-vs.-GNU/Linux debates.  Someone took a common distro, tallied up
the source code, and found that GNU-based code accounted for only 16%
of it.  The whole naming thing is still debatable, but clearly, at
this time there are many non-GNU contributions to what is considered a
"standard" Linux distro.

(Actually, I don't really get Stallman's argument that it's not only
about giving credit; there's a *principle* involved.  First, Torvalds
GPL'd his kernel at the beginning, without any prompting from Stallman
or the FSF.  So it's not like Torvalds is some kind of
counter-revolutionary; he's just apolitical.  Second, Stallman claims
that the GNU prefix will somehow remind people of the true ideals of
free software (as opposed to apostates like ESR) but how are people
supposed to get that from a name which says nothing about free
software -- unless you know a lot about GNU's history?)

FWIW, we hashed over this in alt.os.linux.slackware a few weeks ago.

I, personally, call it Slackware Linux, Gentoo Linux, RedHat Linux, or
WhateverElse Linux.

That said, there are two sides to every coin.  In Slackware, we counted
- something like 19% of the packages had very close ties to the
FSF/GNU/whatever group.  So 81% is non-GNU?

Well, of that 81%, virtually all the code would have never happened had
it not been for the GNU utilities.  It's all compiled with GCC.  It's
all compiled against glibc.  So it's all GNU, right?

Still, it could be done with GNU, likely...

I don't think there's enough in that argument alone to make a
determination of if it's GNU/Linux or just Linux.  In my book, it's
Linux.  Last I heard, FreeBSD used GCC and glibc - should be they called
GNU/FreeBSD?

Naw.

Linux per se is just the kernel.  What you call the whole system is a
matter of taste and perspective.  I personally appreciate the GNU
vision and think it is important that people have a chance to learn
about it.  Calling it GNU/Linux can help with that.  Calling it just
GNU is as valid as calling it just Linux.

If you are wanting to correct factual errors, section 1 is the least
of the problems.  Patches are, no doubt, welcome.

I've always had a hard time with folks refering to the entire system as
"Linux".  It's misleading at best and, at worst, downright wrong.

I think that, if you check out the history, the kernel was, in fact, just
sort of stuck in to complete the package.

Not quite.  If you read the Wired interview with Linus from whatevermonth
1996 (the one with Linus on the cover), you'll find that his account
differs from your understanding considerably.

It seems that Linus wrote his little minix clone to run on his cheap(ish)
386 hardware and to play around with some of the 386 enhanced instructions
and put it out in the wire (USENET) for folks to fiddle with it.  It
wasn't long before someone came back with a patch for this or that.
Eventually people were porting programs to run on his little kernel.  THEN
Linus was introduced to the GNU project.  He didn't know it existed.
Someone said "Oooh, let's try to port some of the GNU stuff to run on your
kernel and you'll have practically a whole working system!" and Linus said
his own equivalent of "Fuck that, that's too much work... I'll just port
my kernel so that the GNU stuff can run native."  In essence, he filled in
the missing gap.  He put a bandaid on the hole that Stallman get really
hung up on patching with some fancy new industrial bung.

In the history of software, it's almost impossible to give the GNU project
too much credit.

No, it wasn't and still isn't.  It isn't even GPL.  Kinda sad, really.
But that's what happens when you can't keep a handle on your copyrights.

16% of the available packages?  That's a shitpile, if you ask me.

And I'd bet that it was the core of the system, too.  I'd like to see what
percentage of the packages are both non-GNU and have no GNU dependencies.

Well, there's the principle of Free Software.  Linus doesn't do anything
to uphold that principle from his failure to properly aggregate the
copyrights for contributed source to his requirement of using proprietary
software to maintain kernel source.  Free Software requires a level of
philosophical and social commitment of which I don't think Linus is
capable.

No direct prompting, but also no real understanding of what it meant.

"just apolitical"?  Apathy kills.

You don't have to know "a lot about GNU's history" to know what the
project is and what it means to be part of the GNU project.  GNU reminds
us that the system is NOT UNIX.  There is a reason why it's not Unix and
that is because Unix is not by or for the people.  Unix is a tool used to
exploit the needs of the many for the profits of a few.  GNU is a tool
against that exploitation.  GNU is the means by which we can take control
of the means by which we meet our needs.

Linux is just some guy's homework.

That may have been placed there some time ago when there was talk
of inviting Stallman to visit Portland. When I spoke to him on
the phone once, he hinted that he would be willing to visit user
groups that were willing to give credit to the Free Software
movement - something that I have no problem with. The man deserves
the recognition for his significant contributions to our community
even if you don't agree with all his ideas and ideals.

There are influential people who don't like Stallman and try to
minimize his contribution while maximizing Torvald's contribution.
If referring to Linux distributions as GNU Linux helps preserve the
recognition that Stallman and an army of GNU contributors deserve,
while simultaneously recognizing the efforts of Torvalds and the
army of Linux contributors, I think this is a small price.

At one point, Robbie and I had planned on getting together but we

My two cents:  GNU/Linux == Linux.  Whatever the history, whatever credit GNU deserves, the common moniker is, and will continue to be, Linux.  Roll with it.

Message-ID: <200311201922.hAKJMqE14522@gate.daniloff.com>

Hello Linux folkz,
I just noticed one interesting thing on my SuSE 9.0.
I can't listen to misic CD using KDE cdplayer, 
but I can watch DVD movies with sound using xine, and
KDE sound schema is working too. 
If I connect DVD ROM directly to the sound card with 
the auxiliary cable, then I can listen to misic CD's 
as well. 
The question is if Linux uses different sound 
services/fasilities for providing sound for DVD movies 
and musical CD's?

Thanks,

Alex

Correction - Robby and Matt have no intention of changing the name. I seen
nothing on the "pdxlug" list archive that even vaguely looks like a
discussion of the issue. All that's there is a flat refusal by Matt - "end
of story!"

Making matters worse if Robby or Matt don't like what you have to say they
ban you from their list and from mailing them directly. That is what
happened when I confronted them about this issue in July. It seems that
"pdxlug" is an authoritarian operation.

As I foretold in July this issue is NOT going to just go away until the
"pdxlug" autocrats come up with their own name.

Yes, all operating systems do, generally speaking.

Normally, CDs are played, as far as the OS knows, by telling the CD
drive to play the CD.  The CD player then reads the CD and outputs the
audio over that dinky little cable directly to the sound card, which
sends the audio right out to the speakers - no real software involved. 
That's why you can play CDs in DOS with no sound card drivers at all.

Now, there are exceptions to every rule - to allow for playing CDs with
things like USB CD drives and the like, there are now several CD playing
utilities out there that don't just tell the CD drive to play the CD -
they actually read the music from the CD and send it to the soundcard
themselves, with lots of software involved.

DVDs are decoded entirely with software.  That is, the drive itself
doesn't decode the audio at all - it leaves software to do that.  Due to
the nature of DVDs, this is the only feasable option.  DVDs can have
multiple audio tracks for different languages or different setups (5.1
surround vs 2-speaker stereo, for example)...

Hope this helps and makes sense...

Hmmm... I wonder if I got banned.  I know I used to be on the PDXLUG
list, don't remember unsubscribing, and am definitely not getting list
email now.

Then again, there could be any number of other explanations.  After all,
it's not like I tick people off every now and then.  :-x

For the record, and to throw some facts in:

      * There are many minors. in PLUG.
      * Many people have kids they (would) like to bring to the
        meetings.
      * Minors are allowed at the Meeting (PSU) but not at the Lucky
        Lab.
      * Minors are allowed at the Clinic.
      * Minors are allowed at the Advanced Topics (last time I checked).
      * We used to get minors into the Market Street Pub, but they
        cracked down.
      * The LAB used to let minors in, but they cracked down.

We used to go to the MSP, but it sucked as we got more people per
meeting.  Well, you might say it sucked before then too.  I tried real
hard to find a place that would:

     A. Absorb a rand(50 People) group of people without notice or $
        commitment.
     B. Have Beer (other forms of libations good).
     C. Have food.
     D. Have service (since the MSP does not really have any fast
        service).
     E. Be reasonably priced.
     F. Be easy to get to.
     G. Allow Minors.

The list is in approximate order.  I asked around for a ling time,
shocked to learn that PSU did not have a pizza joint that fit the bill. 
I mean all college campuses have this within stumbling distance, right?

So I scouted around and found the Lab, it excelled in A, B, C, D and E. 
F meant we had to drive/carpool/ride there.  No street cars at the
time.  We thought we had G since its a Restaurant, and the signage was
not correct.

Now I dislike the LAB for the following reasons
     I. We have to drive there (or ride).
    II. The beer or food makes me unreasonably sleepy.  I think this is
        an allergy and a personal issues.
   III. It is noisy and hard to hear.  This is a huge issue.
    IV. We no longer get the room it seems (we never reserved it).
     V. The food is OK, if limited, and at least peanuts are back.

Now if people make solid suggestions for a better place, I am all ears. 
We have been using JAX for Advanced Topics and the response has been
pretty good.  Its main issue is Price.  We have worked a deal where
happy hour food is available to us at the beginning of the talks.  I bet
we can swing this for after PLUG.

So if people want to move the JAX after PLUG.  Email this thread (not
me, I want to world to see it).  And if you want to stay, email the
thread.

If you have a better suggestion, please email the thread, or me.  I do
not have much time to research places, but if it hits the A-G criteria,
then we will look into it.  Bonus points if we can walk to it, or ride
the street car.

I've had the privilege of spending quite a bit of time with Richard
Stallman and Linus Torvalds, thanks to my role with Geek Cruises
(www.geekcruises.com).

While Richard definitely gets credit for the FSF and GNU project and
GCC and GNU Emacs and most of the other GNU Tools, Linus did what
Richard was unable to do: create the kernel.

You disrespect Linus for his essential contribution when you call it
GNU/Linux, which is merely RMS's attempt to ride on the coat-tails of
another product.

Knowing RMS and Linus personally, I request that you respect the
expressed wishes of Linus on this, and just call it Linux.  RMS can
and will get his legendary status by other means.

Subject: [PLUG] Electrical Blackout Follow-Up
Message-ID: <1069361362.5922.182.camel@pookie>

Dear Friends,

As quoted from the Yahoo! news wire here:

http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20031119/ap_on_re_us/blackout_software_glitch_2
  
"Not only did the software that controls audible and visual alarms stop
working at 2:14 p.m. EDT, but about a half hour later, two servers
supporting the emergency system failed, too. More than an hour would
pass after that before anyone in FirstEnergy's control room would
realize that the software ??? General Electric's GE Harris XA21 system ???
wasn't working."

You know why the XA/21 "wasn't working?" Here's why:

A close inspection of the time lines presented on pages 22 and 23
reveals that the Emergency Management System alarm functions (SCADA)
first fails at 14:14 EDT. These alarm monitoring systems are the
computers running on the Windows Servers.

14:20 EDT: FirstElectric loses half their remote consoles as the worm
spreads.

14:41 EDT: the Primary EMS server (the Windows Primary Domain Controller
running SADA) fails.

14:54 EDT: the backup EMS server (the Backup Domain Controller) server
fails.

15:08 EDT: FE primary EMS Server Restarts.

15:46 - 15:59 EDT: FE IT rebooting H4,H1 (GE XA/21)

Take a look from the same article:

"FirstEnergy's information technology staff belatedly became aware of
the problem and tried to fix it. In fact, they thought they had shortly
after 3 p.m. ??? at which point two of the three power lines had already
tripped. 

"Just as you may have to reboot your desktop computer, which often cures
computing problems, that's what they did," said Jimmy Glotfelty, a
member of the government task force that investigated the blackout.

"They had the indication that they fixed the alarm problem, but that was
erroneous." 

"They did not adequately test the system after the reboot to be sure
they had fixed it," said David Meyer, another task force member."

So it appears that after the Primary EMS server restarted at 15:08, they
looked at the SCADA software on the system and found that it seemed to
be working correctly, that is, the PDC system running SCADA came up and
communicated with the XA/21 system shortly before the DDOS attacked the
PDC all over again.

Given that I have seen a down PDC freeze a BDC (usually while the BDC is
updating itself with the primary server) I think they said, "we'll worry
about the BDC later, we have bigger fish to fry."

So what do they do? It appears that they rebooted the XA/21! Here we
have a DDOS on the NT alarm monitoring server and they decide to bounce
XA/21! Worse, they rebooted the XA/21 without even so much as performing
an analysis on the XA/21 or--and this is a fact as well as a big
"no-no"--telling the control staff monitoring the grid that they were
doing it.


Very  Truly Yours,

Altho, I don't normally refer to Linux as GNU Linux unless I'm using a
Debian based distribution, I do think it is important to recognize the
important contributions of Richard Stallman.  The Open Source
movement wouldn't be where it is today without Stallman, and there
people who minimize his contribution simply because they don't agree
with him on various issues.

Leave out the leading "-" and it should work. 
rsync -av --exclude-from="/backup/excludes"  test3/  /tmp/testbackup
where 
/backup/excludes looks like
Transfer/
scans/
temp/

Could be a path problem or a case issue.
Also if you are mounting a Samba share, a good idea that I picked up from
http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/
is to use --modify-window=10

Message-ID: <1069369991.9043.56.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I'm wondering what facility sends error messages from my onstream
drive directly to the screen.  Is there a C function I can search
for in the source code.  When running taper, it's not nice to
have errors pop up on the screen. This messes up the display.

One curiosity in RH 7.3 is that kernel messages go to /var/log/messages,
yet there's no kern.* line in syslog.conf by default.  What's including
them in messages?  Is there a command to determine all the log levels?
When writing a program, what log levels do I want to use?  Can new
log levels be created in a standard way?  I wish fewer wildcards
had been used so that it's easier to see what's getting logged
and easier to break it out.

DVD's don't have to be decoded in software. First of all, I assume you mean
audio portion, because DVD video hardware decoder cards are quite commonplace,
few even have Linux support.
As for audio, you can get the digital signal out of the DVD drive if it has
the S/PDIF connector. You can send this signal to your sound card, if it has
the same connector (also known as digital CD input, but there is nothing
special about its CD-ness). All Sound Blaster cards starting from Live do
have it, although some require extra stuff to actually get to it. Quite a
few others have it too.
Then you can have digital audio come out of the card, though its digital out
(again, all SB's have that one too). If the DVD was recorded in Dolby 5.1
or DTS or whatever, that's what you'll get, it's all bits so far.
Now you need something which can convert bits to sounds. I have a regular
receiver with digital inputs which does the conversion and drives the speakers,
but you can also get some speaker systems with external amplifiers which
take S/PDIF, Creative makes one, I saw few more, Labtec I think makes one,
probably more.

Post the command line, the file name, and the file contents exactly to
the list.

The exclude commands is not intuitive, but makes sense after
understanding:

>From the man page:

  o      if  the  pattern  starts with a / then it is matched against the
              start of the filename, otherwise it is matched against  the  end
              of the filename.  Thus "/foo" would match a file called "foo" at
              the base of the tree.  On the other hand, "foo" would match  any
              file  called "foo" anywhere in the tree because the algorithm is
              applied recursively from top down; it behaves as  if  each  path
              component gets a turn at being the end of the file name.

       o      if  the  pattern  ends with a / then it will only match a direc-
              tory, not a file, link or device.

       o      if the pattern contains a wildcard character from  the  set  *?[
              then  expression  matching  is  applied using the shell filename
              matching rules. Otherwise a simple string match is used.

       o      if the pattern includes a double asterisk "**"  then  all  wild-
              cards  in  the  pattern  will match slashes, otherwise they will
              stop at slashes.

       o      if the pattern contains a / (not counting a trailing /) then  it
              is  matched  against  the  full  filename, including any leading
              directory. If the pattern doesn?t contain a / then it is matched
              only against the final component of the filename.  Again, remem-
              ber that the algorithm is applied recursively so "full filename"
              can actually be any portion of a path.

       o      if  the  pattern  starts  with "+ " (a plus followed by a space)
              then it is always considered an include pattern, even if  speci-
              fied  as  part  of an exclude option. The "+ " part is discarded
              before matching.

       o      if the pattern starts with "- " (a minus followed  by  a  space)
              then  it is always considered an exclude pattern, even if speci-
              fied as part of an include option. The "- "  part  is  discarded
              before matching.

       o      if  the  pattern is a single exclamation mark ! then the current
              include/exclude list is reset, removing all  previously  defined
              patterns.

So you might want to exclude files, paths, or both.  I often cheat and
do something like
find /path | grep 'pattern' > exclude file

This works 90% of the time, unless there are funky chars in the names.

syslog messages are sent to syslog, and then resent.  There does seem to
be some errors from low level process that get blasted to the screen. 
Log root into the console on port 1 ([CTRL] ALT F1) and leave it idle. 
If messages appear there it is likely syslog.  I seem to vaguely
remember that there syslog defaults to consoles when it cannot properly
report certain critical errors (try having a broken syslogd, you find
this stuff out).  I forgot the criteria for this though.


stderr is sent from the running program.  This sound like what you are
seeing.

To test run in a bash shell,
  command > file.stdout 2>file.sterr &

then tail/less the files.  "2>" redirects stderr.  ">" is the same as
"1>" I think, but there is no need to use it.  "2>&1" redirects stderr
to stdout, which can be useful.

The standard kernel make command from a while ago was

  make bzImage > make.log 2>&1
  less make.log
     hit 'F'


Note this is for bash only, other shells behave differently.

I don't think I'd quite call the DVD hardware decoder cards
commonplace... with CPUs as fast as they are today, we just don't need
'em anymore...

I was unaware of this connector - I've never seen any software that
actually plays DVD audio this way... it's all been decoded in software
and run through the sound drivers that I've seen.

Hmmmm... I always thought you needed drivers to run the S/PDIF stuff.  I
know I certainly see more than a few messages on the Alsa-User and
Alsa-Dev mailing lists about folks trying to get S/PDIF working, saying,
"But it works in Windows..." ... which implies, to me, we're still
looking at drivers (software).

CD drives, on the other hand, don't need any software running on the
machine.  I had a soundblaster compatable soundcard halfway plugged in
once.  It was a 16-bit ISA card, only making contact on half the pins. 
It was enough that it got power, but not enough for any kind of drivers
to be working at all.  In troubleshooting the system (I didn't realize
the soundcard had come out), I tried playing a CD on the system - I
popped in a CD and hit the play button on the drive.  Music came out the
speakers...

Dear All:

I found out recently that my network card (on a RH9 box at work) is 
connecting in 10Mbps half duplex.
My network admin said that the network autonegotiate.  So if I ever
hit a load that requires 100 Mbps, it will automatically do so.

I am a bit lost by that.  Let's say that I buying his theory,
is there anyway from RH9 I can force the connection to 100Mbps full duplex 
mode?

That's a load of crap as far as I'm concerned I don't think any network
driver negiotiate's it interface speed based on it's "requirements"

But the common wisedom with Linux is not to force it's duplex setting. 
I haven't had any good experiences forcing duplex.

However speed you should be able to set.  Try mii-diag or mii-tool to
change the speed.  Or it might be a lilo boot setting.

The only time the card will autonegotiate is when it is started up or
when the switch/hub it is connected to is cycled.

The NIC dirvers (modules loaded at startup) have settings that can be
set in your /etc/modules.conf file.  I.E. the e100 module can be forced
to 100 Full duplex with the following entry in the /etc/modules.conf
file: 

alias eth0 e100
options e100 e100_speed_duplex=4

Other drivers/modules have different options.  Do a strings on the
module or read the manual to find out how to set your NIC.

Vincent,

Do you know if your NIC is connected to a HUB, switch or another NIC?
The network card will set the speed to the lowest of the two ends (let's
say if your card is capable of doing 100 Mbps/Full Duplex, but it is
connected to a 10 HUB, then the speed will be set 10 Mbps/Half duplex).
Forcing the speed to 100/Full will result in Duplex mistmatch and you
won't be able to connect (reliably) to the other end.

The driver can be forced to specific speeds using parameters, or you can
use ethtool (man ethtool) ethtool -s eth0 speed 100 duplex full. 
You may be able to get more help by providing the type of NIC and/or the
driver you use.

Regards,

Emil

I have been using WEP to secure my coms but I have always wanted to got to a 
more secure method. 

Basically I have a WAP plugged into a switch. I have a 486DX4-120 with 24MB

IPSEC or some sort of VPN, but I am not sure where to go from here. I also 
have a P3-500 runing win2k as a server that I am willing to run Linux on if 
that is needed. 

What software would you use to implement a VPN/secure wireless netrwork?
How would you go about doing this?
What are you Caveats?
What have I/others missed?

Thank you in advanced,

The kernel's debug-message facility.  You can see the last chunk of
those messages with the dmesg command, and they're often logged to
/var/log/dmesg.

printk().  Be careful what you comment out, though.

In theory, those messages are meant to communicate information you
should know NOW.  Like, say, something is badly broken.  If they're
really just worthless debug output, and everything's working nicely for
you, I'd strongly recommend sending off an email to the driver author.

Thanks for all the replies.
Here is more details and also the strange part.  I don;t know if I am 
connected
to a hub.  I was told that the network router can autonegotiate
between 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps.  It will default to 10 Mbps.  When
certain conditions are met (and the network guy did not say what kind of 
conditions),
and that the requested bandwidth is higher than 10 Mbps, the router will
autonegotiate to higher bandwidth, that is for those NICs that can go higher 
than 10 Mbps.

I never heard of such a "autonegotiate" feature (that is based on
content being transmitted).  I know they autonegotiate but
always go on the max available bandwidth agreeable on both ends.
I am no networking guru so all I can
do is just question his statement.  I just downloaded a tool from Lawrence 
Berkeley
Lab (http://www-didc.lbl.gov/NCS/netest) and ran it.  I am indeed
getting at most 9.xx Mbps for the test.

Is there such a "autonegotiate" feature based on content size?

Thanks again for all the replies.

Vincent,

  Almost certainly not. I have 2 fast-ethernet switches here (100mbps). When
I boot a laptop the NIC connector always comes up in 100mbps mode. There's
no load on the cable at this point, other than handshaking.

  I think you're being handed a line. But, others have written this before
me.

Well, how many people have external amplifiers connected to digital out
of their sound cards? Without such connection, the best you can do is
"record" from S/PDIF and set it to "monitor" so the signal is sent through
the card's DAC to the analog outs, and that takes software support.

No, you don't need drivers. What you do need is a mixer which can enable
the S/PDIF in and out (and the mixer, of course, talks to the low-level driver,
so you do need it, but not for playback itself). For some cards which come
with enough connectors digital in/out is just there, can't be enabled or
disabled, then you don't even need drivers.

If your sound card has digital input enabled, and a receiver connected to
digital out, DVDs will play (the audio part) like that too. The reason it seems
unusual is a) SB does not enable digital in/out by default, and b) very
few people have external decoders, while analog CD input is always enabled,
and the card does not need any software to send the analog signal from inputs
to its amplifier and out to speakers.

Thanks for your reply.

I first came across this problem when I was looking into dmesg.  One of the 
output,
from the NIC, registered as half duplex at 10 Mbps.
The network guy says that connectivity will default at 10 Mbps
and subsequent content fetch could boost the speed to 100 Mbps
(hence, "autonegotiate" based on content size).
Now we need to waste our time to "negotiate" with the network group
to default us to 100 Mbps.  I think that is what we need to do.

Run a P2P VPN with OpenVPN and route all the packets through the VPN. 
Get the OpenVPN 1.5 RC 1 version and use the --route option to send
packets through without having to worry about loops (it sets the static
route itself).

s/you/the/ ... AFAIK, there's *no* way to really secure a wireless
link.  Without MAC filtering, anybody can still connect to your WAP. 
With MAC filtering, anybody can grab your MAC address out of the air and
set their own MAC address to match it.  WEP can be cracked, given a
little bit of time.  Something needs to be set up to deal with this
properly.

I've got to ask... if you didn't notice the problem until you were
looking at the dmesg output, do you really think you need the full
100Mbps connection?

10/half, for most things, really isn't that much slower than 100/full. 
If you're tunneling uncompressed X applications, regularly moving big
files (by big I mean 200+ MB), running uncompressed VNC, or something
similar... you'll notice a difference with 100/full.  Otherwise, you
probably won't be able to tell at all.

I usually live off my WiFi link.  I max out at about 4Mbps.  I don't
honestly care unless I'm moving big files around... which is when I plug
in the CAT5 and fire up eth1.

I'd hate for you to have wasted a bunch of time for something that isn't
going to be any better than what you have now...

You are correct to ask that.

I am using VNC.  We, as a team, do move a lot
of files between boxes.  These are mostly gene sequences files
and they do get pretty big in size.  40 MB per file on average (some are 
bigger,
some are smaller) and we talking about
several hundred files at a time.

Yeah, if we have to wait 20 minutes for a file to download,
no big deal.  But if we could have shorten that to 10 minutes, on a backbone
that could support higher bandwidth but not turned on for some odd reasons, 
why not?

I can see it now.

1. Plane crashes because of NT failure (like divide-by-0?).
2. Disgruntled ex-sysadmin tells everyone he recommended sticking with
Un*x because of its robustness, but was overruled by clueless PHBs who
were more impressed by the nice dinner they got from the MS salesmen.

I think you'll find that the vast majority of "economic growth" in the
past twenty-five years is of this nature or similarly unproductive stuff.

[for example, the disposable flatware and dinnerware industry is better
than 200x what it was 25 years ago.]

Smell the progress.

This is a good time to trot out my favorite, "The last hours of the

The manual doesn't really cover LVM snapshots.  It has been talked about 
on the mailing lists.  Normal copies of the database files won't work if 
the server is running; only an instantaneous snapshot will be 
consistent.  Now, the database and logs are consistent but they aren't 
in a known state.  That requires stopping the server.

The pg_dump can be slow for really large data sets.  I don't think it 
slows down serving queries.  It returns a consistent view of the 
database because it runs in a transaction.  It is possible to get 
individual databases in a known state but disabling client access before 
the dump.

Carla, just to cure your ignorance...
It's unethical and not funny to make jokes over death of Kursk, 
and other military or civilian personnel. 
Soviet submarines didn't have conventional computers per say.
They were mostly analog ones with parallel signal processing.
Latest models were based on optical bus, memory and processors.
I can tell you a story, that when CIA and Pentagon switched from 
UNIX mainframes to Win NT workstation for all encrypted data processing, 
CIS (former USSR) intelligence units had a big celebration. 
Before that it would take them a week to brake US military code, and after 
transition to NT just a couple of minutes.

They can guarentee the framerate on a heavily loaded system, which a main
processor can't. They also tend to use a lot less power in doing so.

You're plain wrong about the hardware decoders, they are very common.
Maybe not every system out there, but likely more than 50%. At least as
of the Radeon 7500 (and I believe pretty much every ATi chip sold under
the "Radeon" moniker) all ATi chips support hardware decoding of MPEG
streams. The interesting bit is that on the Radeon 9xxx cards there is
no special purpose circuit, they simply reprogram the texture units in
an appropriate way. Some of the nVidia GeForce 4 (specifically the MX,
and Go) chips, and I belive all the GF5 chips support MPEG decoding. With
the closed-source drivers (ugh!) this should be usable with Linux or
FreeBSD via the XVideo extension.



Thinking of such topics...  What are the requirements for handling
"progressive scan" DVDs? Does it have to be done of component cables?
Can be be run over S-Video cables? Composite cables? (perhaps silly, but
it would be interesting to know)

I seriously doubt that you are directly connected with the network
router (and if your network router can pull 100Mbps or even 10Mbps from
the internet, I'm extremely envious).  The most likely scenario is that
you are connected to a network hub which is connected to a network
switch which is connected to the network router.  The rest of the
computers in you corner of the office are most likely all connected to
the same hub, which is connected to the switch which is connected to the
router.  If your facility is small enough, you may be plugged directly
into the switch, which is connected to the router.

Hubs are dumb, they negotiate as best they can when you first plug into
them, and that is the best you are going to get.  They have no concept
of renegotiating, particularly if some sort of computing is involved. 
They are also a broadcast only device, every computer on the hub has to
wait it's turn.

Switches on the other hand are usually pretty smart, especially the
industrial grade ones.  I'm not talking about the Netgear, or Linksys
switch you can buy at Fry's for $99, but the $1000+ 24-port devices that
have full management capabilities.  They have the ability to set the
port speed and duplex rate, but I have never heard of one that will
automatically adjust the speed based on some arbitrary criteria.

I think you should follow the wire, see for yourself the make and model
of the device at the other end of your ethernet cable.  That will go a
long way toward disproving the "autonegotiate" possibility.

Good Luck,

I think it was just a little sensitivity about making light of the
deaths of real flesh and blood human beings, particularly those of
other nations.  Imagine listening to a foreigner making jokes about
the funny way people flailed their arms after they jumped out a world
trade center window.

However, easily disproved by _reading_ the PDXLUG mailing list.
Though, I suppose it depends on your definition of "cool".

Hmmmm... wuzzup with 'particularly those of other nations' ?

Errrmmm.. does that mean it's worse to make light of another nation's

Hello Linux folkz,

The problem is that I can't even mount them on my Linux box.
In order to read a CD header, I created one CD image using XCDRoast,
opened it with less and red:
Apple_partition_map
Toast 5.0.2 HFS Builder
Apple_HFS
Could somebody tell me please what options I should specify in kernel or

Many thanks in advance,

Your net admin is right and wrong.  The connection is auto-negotiated.
Hopefully, supposedly.  It does not auto-negotiate based on traffic.
As Rich pointed out, auto-negotiation occurs when the link goes live
between the hub (or switch) and the end station device.

Some people, to "simplify" their administrative life, set both the 
switch and the end device to auto detect and let the hardware handle
port speed and duplex.  It's been my experience that this is so 
unreliable as to be not worth using.  

Use the miig tool or edit your modules conf to set your NIC for 
100/Full and test your throughput.

HFS is the old MacOS filesystem. Try telling mount "-t hfs".

Try "file -s /dev/your_cd_drive_device_node" to find out what kind of
filesystem is on the CD.

Rob,

  I suspect that I'm not the only one who thinks it is just the opposite:
the immature and clueless went to the PDXLUG list not realizing how their
petulance and child-like attitude could have consequences.

It's not so much hero worship as it is the fact that GNU software
comprises a far higher percentage of your typical Linux installation
than the kernel itself. ls, rm, cat, find, test, grep, etc, etc, etc.
Without GNU you wouldn't have much of an OS. Or I guess you'd resort to
being BSD.

GNU software may well be a larger percentage.... but the kernel is the
part that really counts.  Without the kernel, it isn't Linux.

I would be willing to wager the KDE/KOffice project provides more lines
of code than GNU software does on many systems.  It may provide more
individual commands to run, as well.  I would imagine it likely uses up
more disk space, as bloated as it is, than most GNU projects.  Yet
nobody even thinks to start calling it KLinux.  Why?  KDE isn't nearly
as important as the GNU stuff.

In my opinion, the GNU stuff isn't nearly as important as the kernel.

You can run all those GNU things almost anywhere - I grabbed as many GNU
utilities as I could compile on my slowarus shell account to feel more
at home.  Nobody wants to call it GNU Solaris, though.  I ran CygWin in
Windows - nobody wants to call it GNU Windows.  FreeBSD uses a whole
slew of GNU utilities, and I think also glibc - nobody wants to call it
GNU FreeBSD, but it seems to use as much GNU as Linux does.

The kernel is what makes it Linux, not the GNU.

People do not believe it's possible to simplify technical things. The
irony is that when someone does it well, like saying that "the virus
over taxed the monitoring system so that it could not tell others about
the problem" some geek comes along and says "That's oversimplified, what
really happened was a DDOS (sp?)...." and trails on, much less
succinctly.

I make most of my consulting money because I speak English as my primary
language. It is a LOT more work to communicate if you force yourself
know your audience. Saying things like "I can give you a more technical
explanation if you like" or "let me know if this isn't detailed enough"
or, my favorite for groups "I'm not trying to insult anyone here, so If
I'm leaving anything out, let me know."  any of those helps me get to
the audience I'm trying to talk to at the level they want to be talked
to. You know like that commercial where they're having a party and one
guy tries to explain the reason to another guy. one is a geek, the other
a PHB. The geek explains the systems involved and what was done, but
only gets through with the line "we're saving millions." IIRC

I sense much flame in you. Flame leads to the dark side. ;-)

To be clear -- I was helping provide light on the argument rather than
"oh, it's just hero worship." Certainly in my own case I only use the
GNU/Linux moniker in only the most formal written material, not in
conversation, casual email, or irc.

Definitely think of me as the 'devil's advocate'.

Without GNU, Linux's just a sort of amusing hardware validator.

Certainly a good argument.

In all these cases, GNU is just bolted on. In the case of Linux, it
wouldn't run without them.

Not libc. And FreeBSD will run without GNU, iirc. But, it may interest
you that Debian is working a flavor of "GNU/FreeBSD".

> The kernel is what makes it Linux, not the GNU.

At the heart of it, yeah. But if I did a total conversion of everything
in Solaris to GNU (all the init, system scripts, everything), then for
anything other than specialized applications such as advanced
firewalling, the system would be indistinguishable from a Linux
computer. (i.e., far beyond just feeling "at home", as it were). So, in
this regard, perhaps you're right -- the kernel is the only thing that
makes it Linux. But, at the heart of it, aren't you *really* using the
GNU system with the Linux flavor? Like we've both said above, all the
other examples will stand on their own.

Remember, RMS isn't advocating calling it just "GNU". That ... ahem ...
uh ... distinction ... is reserved for Hurd.

Just playing the opposition. :-)

Oh, and to preempt the counter-argument: Yes, Linux like BSD could write
all it's own core tools (ls, rm, etc). The point is, it hasn't.

Hmmm.... could you use ICC, busybox, uclib, etc....?

LNX-BBC provides quite the setup without glibc.  It is compiled with
GCC, however.  It also includes the GNU file utilities.

Also, on the GNU/FreeBSD thread - Gentoo has been looking at providing
something based around the FreeBSD kernel, as well.

My sister is going to New Zealand for three months.  She has a digital

She isn't particularly geekish.  Anybody been to NZ recently, know
what facilities are like?  Any ideas in general on how to solve the
problem.  One idea I had in the shower this morning was to put some
kind of SCP.EXE program on the smart media filesystem.  Will that work

Hmmmm... I suppose you could. It wouldn't be Free (icc), nor would it be
very useful apart from specialized uses, but it would go beyond booting.
I *personally* don't think it goes far enough to stand on its own.

FWIW-As a 'status update', I get the impression from following the
mailing list (which is nearly as bad as trying to follow lkml,
volume-wise), that the sarge+1 timeframe will see this 'completed'.

Finally reading the article.  IMHO best quote:

   Critics of Open Source software often point to the lack of product
liability. 
   Garden Grove chooses instead to focus on how robust and stable Open
Source has 
   been, thus negating the need to hold anyone liable.

Second best:

   The less obvious benefit is a reduction of time cutting through red tape.
With 
   Open Source, staff spends no time writing RFPs, holding bids, evaluating
vendors, 
   seeking management or council approval for funding, or exhaustively
researching 
   competing commercial products. Researching an Open Source product, by
comparison, 
   is simple: Just download it and use it.

I'm originally from Garden Grove, CA. Often the focus of negative news
reports -- Garden Grove is home to "Little Vietnam," which has in the
past erupted in some pretty horrific gang violence -- my home town
surprised me today. For some odd reason, I was poking around the
city's web site and found this very cool page:

 
http://www.ci.garden-grove.ca.us/departments/city_manager/linuxwpaper_html/

There's a related online slide show:

  http://ch.ci.garden-grove.ca.us/internet/gbet/OpenSource.html

The bottom line is that the city manager estimates he saves about
$70,000.00 in direct costs each year, and more in indirect costs (less
paperwork, reduced security exposure, higher system stability, etc.).

This is closer to the root of the problem.  I've personally witnessed
UNIX-based power control computers at an unnamed large western utility
that were subject to trivial remote root exploits.  You didn't even need
to download special software for it and the patches to fix it were several
years old.

In my opinion, most utilities simply don't have the profit margins (or
profit-motivation) to justify paying market-rate sarlaries.  This leads to
some unfortunate situations where the well-qualified workers get snatched
up by other companies.

I've been using Internet Cafes all around the US, and even in odd
ports on my cruises (www.geekcruises.com).  I find that about a third
of them are set up with a typical Windows desktop, and if they are, I
visit "putty.nl" and download and run Putty for an ssh client to get
back to my home box.  The putty site also contains an scp client, but
I think the hitch will be finding a cafe that can read a smartmedia
card.

Putty rocks.  More power to the putty people for making Windows boxes
actually useful to me. :)

I think the easiest is to have a photo or copy shop burn a picture CD.
You should find such a shop in most any town that also has an Internet
cafe.

 Even though the question is whether there are different services (devices) 
for providing sound, I think the simpler question implied (but not answered 
IMO) is how to get the cd to play music.
 I would try using the mixer to see if the slider for the cd is turned up and 
not muted. KISS

Message-ID: <1069442354.3852.39.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I tried probe under Redhat 7.3 but I can't seem 
to get the pci to pcmcia adapter to detect.  I'm 
wondering if there is a special driver for SMC's 
adapter.  I thought practically any pci to pcmcia 
adapter worked under Linux.  On google it looks 
like Redhat 7.3 can run the pc card, but there 
was no info on the adaptor it plugs into.

These are the markings that are on the pci to pcmcia 
adapter card:

PLX Technology
PCI9052 S 0052 T2B BR2129.1 TAIWAN

I believe the adapter says revision 2 on it too.

Is there any probe I can do that would be more
helpful?  If the pcmcia adapter is standard I
want to at least get it working.  I can throw
a prism or orinoco card in a standard adapter
that will take an external antenna.  I have
some large folgers coffee cans saved to make
two antennas out of.  

If I can get this card working I can find out 
about the wireless utilities and the install 
procedure before getting into acquiring some 
prism or Ornioco cards, low loss cable, etc.

Most of the PCI-PCMCIA adapters for wireless cards aren't full bridges.
They only work with the card in question and only with said drivers.

Subject: [PLUG] tip on gdm, man this had me going a while...
Message-ID: <1069441202.3852.21.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I ran into LTSP getting a gray screen and all the standard checks
that the package's website recommends falling flat.  Killing the
gdm process fixed the problem.  I couldn't get X up locally except
via startx.  I was getting Audit: ... client X rejected local host 
in my XFree86.0.log.  I still wonder what happened here.  Maybe 
it's a freak thing.  

A seperate issue, I have been noticing on log out that the 
xdm screen frequently gets trashed, or is it the gdm screen?  
Doing ctrl-alt-backspace cleans the log in screen up, I 
wonder why though?

I installed the Xfree86-base-fonts upgrade package from
updates.redhat.com for Redhat 7,3, but rpm -V says all
the encodings.dir files are missing.  Anyone know the 
fix for this?  Can I still import the keys for these
old distributions?  Google suggested xauth or xhost
something or rather for the Audit problem, but I never 
did figure that out.  The crashed gdm process must have 
gotten a hold of the ports X needs, but why did it 
crash I wonder?  Now would probably be the time to
upgrade, but what worries me is that Redhat has gone
8, 9, Fedora.  All of these are rougher than 
Redhat 7.3 out of the 7.x series.  I've played with 
7.2 and have noticed a lot of stuff just works better 
in 7.3.  The darndest things like iptraf etc. have 
been broken.  Redhat Enterprise might be a good way
to go, but I don't have $120 thank you let alone any
interest in licensing the right to use a Linux 
distribution.

I'd much prefer a fully debugged Redhat 7.3 over 
fedora.  Even as is so long as X Windows isn't
installed, it has been very stable for me. I'd
say complaints against sys V style scripts are
valid though.

No not a program, the osst driver dumped errors to the console
instead of a log file.  The same thing at least used to 
happen sometimes with floppy drives too.  It would be nice 
if the error logging of various drivers could be linked to 
user defined facilities under menuconfig so that stuff can 
be broken out more without extra processing.  Just
getting driver messages including that error 
recovery is occuring  off the console I'm using 
is what I'm after.  Maybe I can redirect stderr
next time I run taper.  There are lines in osst.c
that say kern_xxx suggesting the logging is supposed
to go to syslog.  Why then does it go to the 
console when a bad sot in a tape is found?  If var 
were not mounted I'd understand, but this isn't the 
case.  If it's the driver writer's fault that's,
very annoying programming style to have a driver
print to stderr.

It has an integrated USB interface and she'll have the right cable.
Pardon my cluelessness re typical windows desktop setups, but is the
USB storage thing likely to work without intervention?  

I have her prepared with a script with which to make inquiries,
basically: "I have a USB camera I want to send pictures home with
... can I do that here?" Can you (or anyone) think of the magic
question to get the Right Answer to: "is this going to be easy" or "am
I going to waste an hour screwing around".

Putting the binary on the smartmedia might remove one step.  pscp.exe
is only 161,280 bytes.

I have done this with USB in several Kinko's and cafe's.  You might not
want to ask first, but just try it and see.

Most cameras look just like hard drives and she can go from there.

Test locally at a few kinko's first.

Cool (if vague) title.  
Last boss had our cards printed with, "Member of the Technical Staff".
We fixed that after he was deposed, but shortly before I was laid off.
Since I took care of HVAC, alarm, building access, routers, T1s, phones,
wiring, receiving, repairs, new hardware installs, desktops *and* any
sysadmin stuff left over from the others, I wish I'd had your job title.

Not apples and oranges.  Part of system architecture is choosing
what works.  Stallman stuck to the microkernel path at the expense
of being able to get a usable system out into the world.  

Rhetorical questions for RMS:  Was having a microkernel worth not
providing a free system to people?  What's more important:  freedom
for people or adhering to an architecturally purer path?

For an analogy:  Should I forgo bicycling until carbon fiber technology
develops to the point where I can get a safe, full carbon frame?  Metals
are here today.

Only if it's running 2k or xp, 98 almost always needs an addition to the
pile of patches.  With ME, it is going to crash and burn no matter what
you do.  When I was in Mexico about a year ago, they all ran 98. 
However, they all had CD-ROM drives, what's one more patch anyway?

Good Luck,

Okay, so I'm late to another thread. So it goes.

First item: the FAQ on the webpage is about PLUG, *not* Linux.

Second item: I suspect that the part that talks about Linux, GNU/Linux,
GNU/BSD/MIT/ABC/XYZ/Linux was last revised by Karl Hegbaum --
although it may be exactly how Neil wrote it almost 2 years ago. I
don't know. When I cleaned up that part of the website back in
January, I was more concerned with removing a number of snide comments
Karl had left on the web pages & trying to restore the older content.

All I know is that the FAQ does not reflect my opinion in this
disagreement. But that the whole argument over whether it should
be Linux or GNU/Linux is definitely more silly than arguing over which
way the toilet paper should sit on the roll. (And it's to RMS's
discredit that he makes it an issue.)

Third item: If anyone wants to make changes to this part -- or any
part of the FAQ or the rest of the web site, all she/he has to do is
email the changes to me. I'll put them up as soon as I can, after
some copy editting, as long as they aren't obviously self-serving
(e.g., ``Joe Schmo is the best Linux consultant in Portland"), or
enflammatory (e.g., ``Only cretins use emacs.")

However, about this section of the FAQ: I will accept revisions
for it if & only if they are accompanied with a substantial submission
for another part of the website. In other words, unless someone is
willing to do some actual work, what's there will stay there -- even
if I don't agree with it.

I dunno, upper management gets "market-rate" (i.e. insane) salaries.  

I think a lot of this has to do with the drive to put everything on the
internet.  A few years ago, remote access was done with a dedicated
phone line and modem.  Nowadays, folks just plug the sucker into The
Interweb and install PC-Anywhere.  Heck, it's gotta be on the net to
register the OS anyway...

Should be interesting to see where this stuff goes.

Can somebody explain how to check the actual speed of a modem connection?

Gentoo Linux
a Conexant modem
old (free) hsflinmodem driver
wvdial 1.53
pppd 2.4.1

wvdial says "CONNECT 115200" after dialing the number, but I'm pretty sure that's not an indication of the established speed.  That's just read from wvdial.conf.

Give statserial a try or look under proc.  Are you using a standard isp
or have you set up your own private dial up server?

This is a matter of how the music is extracted from the CD.  The
original function of a CD-player was to extract the music for analog
output, that is the usual way that a CD-player pipes sound to a sound
card when reading audio CD's.  This is a four pin all-in-a-line
connector on the back of the player and a similar set of connectors on
the sound card (or motherboard for integrated sound), there are usually
only three wires that make up the cable.  Software is only used to start
the player (the player itself may have a play button as well), once it
is playing you can close the program and it is possible that it will
keep playing, I know that WorkMan behaves this way.

Modern CD and DVD players are also capable of digital output of the
extracted audio.  Sometimes it has to go out the IDE cable, where
software of some sort has to deal with it. (Winblows has a feature in
the CD-drivers properties to switch between analog and digital
extraction for CD playback.)  And sometimes it has an additional digital
out port and that can also be connected directly to the sound card, or
other converter/amplifier, but it will require a different cable.

If your modem supports it, try ATS95=0 or 1

Wait a minute, the pc card itself at least is well documented 
for Linux use.   

Check out:
 http://www.guerrilla.net/reference/80211_mod/SMC2632_antenna_mod/

That provides a means to modify the antenna so that an external one
can be used.  I'm not up on doing the modification myself,
but my EE brother might be.


I should be able to plug this adapter into a pci to pcmcia bridge
that Linux can support shouldn't I?  Where can I get one?

This is what's written on the largest square chip on the pci to 
pcmcia adapter:  PLX Technology PCI9052 S 0052 T2B BR2129.1 TAIWAN.
Anyone recognize this bridge?  Do I need to look for some other
writing on it?  The pc card comes up under google where the pc 
card was taped to this thing with what looks like manufacturers
tape.  I got this from a guy in Canada.  I'd be surprised if 
someone out there hasn't gotten either the bridge that comes 
with it to work under Linux or another bridge to work.  Surely
there's a Linux compatibility list for pci to pcmcia bridges?

Another part of system architecture involves meeting design goals.
It may not matter if it works if it doesn't achieve the goals. I'm
not privvy to Stallman's goal back then but suppose he wanted the
reliability that well-written microkernels ensure and monoliths
like Linux cannot?

  It's surprisingly tough to do from a PC.  One way is to use minicom (or
some other term program) to connect to your modem and use AT commands to
check your link stats.  You need to set your modem to "Ignore DTR" before
you start with "AT&D0".  This prevents the modem from hanging up and
clearing its registers when you kill pppd.  

1) Use minicom to set DTR to ignore.  AT&D0
2) Dial up your ISP and surf.
3) Kill pppd to release the serial port.
4) Use minicom and AT commands to read the TX/RX stats.  

  Here's the fun bit, the AT commands aren't standard.  Each modem chipset
will use a different command string(s).  Some modems don't have stats at
all.  This site has a list of the more common commands.  

http://www.modemsite.com/56k/diag.asp

  The CONNECT speed may be correct or it may only be the speed of the serial
port.  Modern modem chips are actually intelligent little communication
coprocessors.  The serial port is often running at a fixed speed.  The modem
buffers the data to match the real line speed to the serial port speed.  The
real line speed is constantly being renegotiated and changed as necessary.

  One handy trick is to use AT commands to set a minimum speed in your
modem.  Your modem will disconnect if the line tries to negotiate below that
level.  The higher speed AT commands are non-standard.  You will have to
check the docs for your modem.  

There are many web based speed testers:
http://us.mcafee.com/root/speedometer.asp

a whole Google directory of them:
http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Data_Communications/Testing_and_To
ols/?tc=1/

  If you're talking to another *nix box, there is a very nice little utility
called "bing", for Bandwidth Ping.  It's great for monitoring actual
bandwidth between machines from a script.

In the late-80s or early 90s, I used to run his free software
on my PC-based Coherent system that cost me about $90. Not
free but close enough at the time. Perhaps the availability
of a low-cost Unix-like OS removed the urgency for a free
kernel and Stallman continued down the path he thought would
result in a better kernel.

A loaded question with no answer. I'll simply say that admire
people who seek to achieve excellence in the face of mediocrity.

  This is precisely the reason Andy (Minux) Tanenbaum gave Linus poor marks
for his OS design.  Any *serious* designer would have written a microkernel.


  "I still maintain the point that designing a monolithic kernel in 1991 is
a fundamental error. Be thankful you are not my student. You would not get a
high grade for such a design :-)"  Andy Tanenbaum 1992

http://www.dina.dk/~abraham/Linus_vs_Tanenbaum.html

  But this fails to explain why microkernels haven't taken over the world,
and why OS design classes are commonly taught using Linux, not Minux.
Sometimes *it works* is good enough.  (Just ask Bill Gates.)

Can smoeone elaborate and what makes it difficult to do an
architecturally pure monolithic kernel verses the micro kernel
alternative?  I think I've heard that Linus likes the speed
of a monolith over a micro kernel.  I was looking at a book
by Randolph Bentson the other night on Linux that says a true
micro kernel may be able to have interfaces for other operating
systems, if I read it right.  Threading is apparently a big deal 
now.  I really don't know what it means for computer architecture 
and computer programming.  I seemed like people got too excited
about hyper threading on the Pentium 4 in my cs200 Nix class
along with let's talk about XP instead of Linux.  Really 
irritating.  I didn't learn anything meaningful about threading
in that class other than perhaps to ask about it ;-)

One of the cool things about the Hurd is the idea of operating
system-like services running in user-space, the idea being to allow
users to have their own file systems and so forth that are usually the
domain of an authority figure (the system administrator).  I think
that was definitely one of the design goals: to dis-empower authority
figures and empower end users as much as possible.

Anyone know a good way to print info pages from a text console? In a 
browser like Konqueror, it's easy and they look nice. But I'm trying to 
figure out how print specific pages, rather than an entire voluminous 
info doc, and format them nicely. For example:

 info ls | lpr

cranks out a dozen poorly-formatted pages that run off at the left 
margin. There must be a non-Emacs way...?

How about using mpage to possibly shrink the page size?

Carla,

  I haven't tried it, but I'll bet that enscript will do it for you. Just
off the top of my balding head, I would think that:

	man <whatever> | enscript ...

NAME
       enscript - convert text files to PostScript

SYNOPSIS
       enscript  [-12BcgGhjkKlmOqrRvVzZ]  [-#  copies] [-a pages]
       [-A align] [-b header] [-C[start_line]] [-d  printer]  [-D
       key[:value]]   [-e[char]]   [-E[lang]]   [-f   font]   [-F
       header_font] [-H[num]] [-i indent] [-I filter] [-J  title]
       [-L  lines_per_page]  [-M  media] [-n copies] [-N newline]
       [-o outputfile] [-o -] [-p outputfile] [-p -] [-P printer]
       [-s baselineskip] [-S key[:value]] [-t title] [-T tabsize]
       [-u[text]] [-U num] [-W language] [-X encoding]  [filename
       ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Enscript converts text files to PostScript and spools gen-
       erated PostScript  output  to  the  specified  printer  or
       leaves  it to file.  If no input files are given, enscript
       processes standard input.  Enscript  can  be  extended  to
       handle  different  output  media  and  it has many options
       which can be used to customize printouts.

  I'm certain that if I'm wrong, someone(s) will set me right. :-)

Martin Schulze is the press officer and the stable release manager for
Debian.

This is real.

At this time, only master, murphy, gluck, and klecker are known to be
affected; notably, the master ftp server (auric) is not on this list, so
there is as yet no evidence to suggest the main archive has been
compromised.  Of course, given the timing, care has been taken to ensure
that the 3.0r2 release was completely clean as noted in Martin's email.

Yes, it's quite frustrating to not be able to push any updated packages
into unstable right now... ;)

So what sort of compromise has happened?  I've heard there is some
concern about attempted malicious kernel changes to 2.6 too.  The 
press release should talk about what is being done about the 
problem and what the problem is.  What happened?  What kind of
loser attacks an open source developement server anyways?  I
hope the culprit is caught and made to pay something for the 
damage inflicted if this was done on purpose.

See "info texinfo" and look at the Hardcopy node.

Info files come from texi source.  Find the texi source and run
texi2dvi on them, then dvi2ps and you're set.  I think.  It's been a
while.

For computer architectures, classically it meant: nothing. Symmetric
Multi Threading, SMT, or Intel's marketing "HT" changes this a bit. But,
like SMP, if you're already doing smart multiprogramming, it doesn't
change anything, particularly.

From a software standpoint, it's just shared memory multiprogramming.
Processes share code space, threads share data space as well. (This is
one reason Linux is fast -- in Linux that *really*is* the only
difference -- do "man 2 clone" sometime [but do pay attention to the
"CONFORMING TO" footnote].)

Aside: I've always said variety will make you a better programmer. 
And the more I read around, the more I feel like, despite how much
I hate them, I should spend some time learning Java and .NET ...
Besides, as they say, "To know your enemy, you must become your enemy".

You won't until after CS333 anyways. You need to build up to these
things. Patience. ;-) If you have none: hint, learn about fork(). Then
move on to IPC techniques like shmat(). Learn about locking and mutexes.

Multiprogramming with processes is simpler, safer, and much more
standardized. The jump to threads after mastering this is pretty easy.
Just more dangerous. Hence the impetus to master it with processes
first.

Buy W Richard Stevens "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment".
It's the bible of these sorts of things. It is a bit dated these days,
so be careful in how you read it. Additionally, don't always follow his
example code to the letter, some of it isn't safe anymore. But his
descriptions of semantics and system calls is still vital. I use it
often, myself.

No, that's just because MINIX is dated. I have the book here, MINIX is
just an example of a classic monolithic kernel pared down to bite size
so that students can tinker and experiment with it. Unfortunately, at
the date it was written, this means it *at best* utilizes an 80286. The
file system itself is limited to something like 40MiB. Not only is Linux
more up-to-date for modern technology and teaching, it's also an example
of "something real".

For you debian users, I was just poking around on Adam Shand's wiki
(www.spack.org) and found this:

  <http://www.spack.org/index.cgi/AptHelp>

Lots of details neatly summarized.  First I'd heard of "auto-apt"
too.  Kind of cool.  When compiling things from source, instead of an
iterative ./configure (watching for missed features and manually
installing them), you:

  auto-apt run ./configure

Adam says:  

  ``[...] all things the configure-script is looking for will be
    downloaded and installed "on-demand" and "just-in-time". To be more
    precise: the packages containing the missing files will be apt-get
    install-ed. After all you continue with make and make install as
    normal.''

Wow, indeed...

Just be careful - with such a thing, if I have a program that checks for

I'd say it looks like you'll need to make good use of --disable switches

HT is just Intel's implementation of what is called "Simultaneous
Multithreading" in the academic literature.  The idea is to put two
complete CPU architecture states (registers, PC, status bits, etc.) in
one CPU, and have that CPU rapidly switch back and forth between them,
typically as often as every cycle.  The motivation is that a modern
CPU runs so fast compared to the memory that it often sits idle for
hundreds of clock cycles waiting for some datum that it's loading to
come in from main memory.  Why not be working on something else during
that time?  (The CPU equivalent of having the kernel switch to another
process while servicing a page fault.)

 > Multiprogramming with processes is simpler, safer, and much more
 > standardized.

And a lot slower.

The primary difference between multiple processors and multiple
threads (here I'm thinking of something like POSIX threads) is that
with the former, you create separate processes.  So, from the point of
view of the kernel, and the multiprogramming support hardware in the
CPU, the different processes that make up your parallel program are
indistinguishable from a collection of processes launched by different
users.  If you want them to cooperate on a single problem (usually the
goal, if you're not merely exploiting "job parallelism" by running
many independent tasks in parallel), you need to find some way for
them to share data.

The standard way of passing data back and forth in a distributed
environment is to create sockets, but this is grossly inefficient if
your application requires frequent exchange of data between the
different processes.  So the usual procedure is to create an explicit
block of shared memory, which, at the CPU level, involves editing the
page tables of the different processes so they all point to the same
block of physical memory.  (Naturally, the kernel has to do this for
you.)  Any data that you want to do must be explicitly mapped to this
region.

With a threading package, such as POSIX Threads (or Pthreads), all the
threads are in the same process space.  The kernel is not necessary
for threading to work (though some things may be done there for
greater speed).  The switching of tasks is done at the user level, by
the threading library underneath the user code.  This is a big win if
you happen to have more threads/processors than physical CPUs, because
switching threads is MUCH faster than switching processes.  (Switching
processes may require flushing cache(s) in some architectures.)

In Pthreads, splitting off a thread is just a function call.  The new
thread gets its own stack (for its automatic variables).  It shares
globals with the other thread(s).  The heap is shared, though everyone
gets their own blocks when they call malloc or new (provided the
memory allocation library is written to be "thread-safe").  The
tradeoff here is that, as you say, it is easier to write bad code
which doesn't share data properly, leading to hard-to-debug code which
is non-deterministic.  However, there are mechanisms in the libraries
to do things safely if you choose to use them rather than analyze your
code carefully, and their overheads are still less than interprocess
communication.

No. Not a lot. As I mentioned, in Linux the only difference between
process forks and kernel threads is the way clone() was called. Linux is
very proud of its scheduler and syscall interface reducing the overhead
of process switching to unheard of speed.

I was pointing Michael towards process multiprogramming as a way to learn
things more safely, anyways.

Just to reiterate, this is not true in Linux. And in 2.6 (or 2.4 with

Although, personally I prefer TLP, or Thread Level Paralellism, which
stands in nice contrast to ILP, Instruction Level Paralellism. Thus
suggesting that it's only a difference of scope, will illustrating that
it's on-die. This terminology is seen in some literature, although most
modern literature has adopted SMT. 'Tis a shame. :-) :-)

It seems to be the GNU people who get the most worked up.  I heard an
FSF speaker once, who kept referring to "the kernel known as Linux"
and "the GNU operating system."  Once the point had been made, it
just became irritating.

Yes, but everyone seems to forget that third part.  The way the FSF
people talk, they did all the work, except this tiny little kernel
part that was tacked on at the end.

When Linus released the first Linux, how much of the non-kernel stuff
had been made by the GNU project and how much had been contributed by
other people?

I think much of this boils down to: what constitutes an operating
system?  Arguing that Emacs is part of the OS is sort of like
Microsoft saying IE is a fundamental part of Windows.

Well, if Apple has their way, it *is* taking over the world.

Just to restate my final sentence:

>From their perspective, GNU is the right name for what they are using.
They wrote some things and they borrowed some things, and they decided
to call the result something they like[1].  The same can be said for
others.  

Think about why you find their advocacy annoying.  To me, it seems to
spring from the idea, whether expressed or assumed, that you *must*
call it GNU, whereas I think what ought to be and maybe is expressed
(but sometimes not heard) is that you *can* call it GNU, and by
calling it GNU you might help people learn about important ideas.

[1] in the case of GNU, they decided on the name at the beginning of
    the process, which doesn't make it more valid than someone elses
    choice, but it does seem to indicate that the choice was sincere.

It's probably not "transmitting" anything at all, other than SYN 
packets. It's probably just checking for a new version.

If you're actually worried about it, fire up a packet sniffer and watch 
for yourself.

Depends a bit on the type of hardware.  With a process, you've usually got to 
do a fair amount of memory remapping.  That can be expensive.  TLB flushing 
can result on some processors and that can really be expensive (the refill).  
Processors with process tags on the TLB entries often lessen this impact.

The scheduler knows what process to run next in O(1) time, but the amount of 
work to do the switch depends on the type of process (full process, thread, 
something in between), and I think on what kinds of things the process did.  
I believe that if the process does not use floating point, the switch is 
somewhat faster as the scheduler doesn't push the floating point context.  I 
may be wrong on this.  There are a lot of variables and it is hard to make 
too many generic statements.

All that said, Linux is definitely one of the best platforms on which to do 
multiprocess code.  Compared to most platforms, it is very fast and effecient 
at process switching.  With threads, it is even faster (or will be in 2.6).

Best,
Kyle

It's alive.  It requires a 2.4.22 kernel from ftp.kernel.org and
surprisingly it's a prism 2 card.  I guess the pci model is the
2602w, so with it plugged into the supplied bridge, this 2632w pcmcia
card comes up as a 2602w card.  There was a special compile option
in 2.4.22 under wireless for the nonstandard bridge the card is on.
I think the tape was so that you can't pull the card out.  The only
disadvantage with this card is no external antenna, though there are 
a delicate set of modifications that fix that involving a soldering
iron, exacto knife...  I wonder if I can use any other wireless card 
in this bridge?

What file do I need to create under /etc/sysconfig for this wireless
adapter and what goes in it?  I see things like receiving threshold
etc. that I would think are more tuning issues than anything.  I
would expect these to be be set at runtime.  Is there a nice 
console tool like menuconfig just for configuring wireless cards 
on a Rehat 7.3 system or do they all require X?

Yeah, orinoco_plx, right? Just dug that up myself in research. Good on
yah, mate.

For most distributions, look in /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts. Some newer
distributions have shim's to set it up "standard-like" (such as Debian),
but usually you can use /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts too.

See iwconfig for twiddling these at runtime.

Frankly, I dunno. wavemon is a nice tool from console for *monitoring*
your connectivity (not sniffing), though. Anybody else have a good
suggestion here? I'm assuming it'd be distro-specific.

-J -r

-J creates Joliet filenames for Windows computers
-r creates Rock Ridge filenames for UNIX computers (and modifies
permissions, if you want to preserve ownerships and permissions, use -R)

You can have both at the same time. Linux supports Joliet, itself, but
it's safer to have RR in case you want to mount on some other UNIX
system.

Yeah... I know Pat V uses them in the Slackware ISO building
instructions.  They give the command:  
mkisofs -o /tmp/slackware.iso -R -J -V "Slackware Install" \
-hide-rr-moved -v -d -N -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table
... minus the isolinux and -x switches.  So it'll likely either be the
R, J, V, v, d, or N flag.  Google probably knows which one, for sure. 
As does the man page.  You did read man mkisofs, right?

Need to install flex.  Is there a way to know this other than
looking it up in a book that says it's a compile tool?
The authors of bind need to provide a requirements file

How do you chroot djbdns?

Is there a bash command that you can use in a script that will make the 
script wait for the user to press a key before it continues?  I have a 
script that creates an iso image and then instructs the user to insert a 
cd before calling cdrecord.  But I don't know how to make the script 
wait for the user to press a key indicating that a cd is in the writer, 
or if it is possible at all.  Does anyone know how to do this?

How about

echo -n "Please insert a CD"
read cd
echo "Thanks for the CD"

read will wait for the input and return key..

Is there a particular reason you are compiling nslookup?  It is included 
in the bind-utils package; the server is in bind.

djbdns is incompatible with BIND.  Not only is the config file 
different, it doesn't read the zone files.

I'm pretty sure a good lp filter will turn texi to ps without any manual
interference.

I'm pretty sure foomatic does this.

I would test it, but I hate printing.

I'm skeptical of all three of those. Shared memory space has the crucial
advantages that pointers can be shared, and you don't have to explicitly
share data (you just grab those portions you need from memory rather than
having to ask another process for particular blobs). Certainly with
processes you don't have the subtle memory corruption problems caused by
locking failures, but depending upon the case other just as large
problems are introduced by processes.

Neither is superior in all cases, sometimes processes win, sometimes
threads win.

And a gigantic loss if you've got at least two processors because only
the kernel can schedule threads to execute simultaneously on multiple
processors (or multiple pseudo-processors in the case of a P4).

Try this one on for a subtle (or perhaps not so subtle as time rolls on)
advantage of separate processes. The standard stack is 8MB, quite a bit
larger than typically needed, but reasonable. Think about what happens
when you get 512 threads...

The reason why thread stacks are typically smaller than process stacks.
Intel doesn't have long to bring a 64-bit processor architecture to the
desktop, somehow I doubt ia64 will make it, are they going to produce
amd64 architecture processors? They going to produce a second 64-bit
architecture of their own?

mplayer should do this, depending on the stream type.

I don't know what it will do about the large file... I can't imagine it'll
barf just because it's writing to a large file, though.

I've had luck with audacity recording up to 3+ hrs.  I stopped it, don't see

What I find annoying is not that they choose to call it GNU/Linux, but
the silly way they make a point about it, like saying "the kernel that
is known as Linux" instead of "the Linux kernel" -- every single time.
(That's what the FSF speaker I heard did -- I don't know if they all
do that.)  It's like a guy I knew who was so fussy about using
politically correct terms that he would globally replace "black" with
"African-American" -- even when we were discussing the *5th Century*.

I've heard claims that Stallman won't talk to reporters unless they
promise to write "GNU/Linux" in their articles.  So it sounds like
they (or at least he) says you *must* call it GNU.

Actually, if they'd just come out and say it's about getting
credit, I could relate to that, as I used to be in academia, where
"getting credit" is everything.  But their argument that the GNU
prefix somehow teaches people about the important issues of free (as
in speech) software makes it sound like they claim a monopoly on
virtue.  If I write a cool app and decide to release it under the
GPL, would sticking "GNU/" in front of the name somehow make it more
clear to most people that this is "software libre"?  (Especially since
the G in GPL now means General, rather than GNU.)

Anyway, my original point was that the PLUG FAQ doesn't adequately
acknowledge the non-GNU, non-Linus contributions to the collection of
programs making up what is now generally considered to be a Linux (or
GNU/Linux) system.  (I'm being deliberately vague here since it's hard
to say exactly what is part of Linux.  Can you say that KDE or Gnome
are "part of Linux" when many distros just have one or the other?  Or
should we say they're *both* part of Linux?)  And that might be
"confusing to newbies" (to borrow an argument from the other thread).

Therefore, I would suggest changing the wording to something like:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux began as an operating system kernel initially created in 1991 by Linus
Torvalds (then a graduate student at the University of Helsinki in
Finland). The kernel acts as the mediator for your programs (processes)
and for your hardware. It takes care of memory management for all
running processes, and gives them access to processor cycles. The kernel
also provides a portable interface for processes to talk to your
hardware.

To be fully useful in a modern computer system, a kernel typically
requires the support of other software, such as libraries,
compilers, editors and shells.  It just so happened that
the Free Software Foundation (FSF) had been undergoing a massive
effort (since 1983) to develop an operating system called <i>GNU's Not
Unix</i> (GNU). By 1991, FSF had developed everything needed for an
operating system except for the kernel.

In 1991, Linus combined his kernel with the GNU System and
finally the world had a 100% free (Libre) operating system. Both the
GNU System and the Linux kernel were released under the General
Public License (usually called the GPL). The GPL is a "free" software
license; this means free in the sense of liberty (Frech libre) not in
the sense of price (think free speech not free beer). It gives you the
freedom to "copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the
software."

With the freedom given by the GPL, many other programmers were able to
make improvements to the kernel and GNU programs, or to contribute
their own components and software to the project.  The result is a
"full-featured" system with graphical layers, desktop environments,
programming tools, and applications.  Many of these programs are also
available with other operating systems, so they are not, strictly
speaking, exclusively a part of Linux.  However, most Linux
distributions typically come with a substantial portion of the
GPL-licensed programs that run on Linux.

Many people prefer to call this system "GNU/Linux" in recognition of
the substantial contributions of the FSF and the GNU project.
Although PLUG has chosen to use the simpler, more commonly-accepted
term Linux, we honor the fundamentally important work that GNU and others have
contributed.

How did you meet them?

BTW, are you the guy who wrote the Perl books for O'Reilly?  If so,
which McMenamin pub did you write Learning Perl in?  And did they ever
give you any free (as in beer) beer for mentioning them? :-)

Quite possibly, however if you just wanted to ultimately print a
subset of pages, then explicitly going through the postscript stage
would allow you to use the plethora of postscript tools to select the
pages you wanted.

Why?  I dunno about you, but I filter out all my mailing-lists first and
just run Bogofilter on Inbox mail.  I initially trained it on the
contents of my Inbox and a collection of recent spam.

Train it on the stuff you want it to filter.  So if it's not gonna be
filtering PLUG stuff, don't show it PLUG mail.  What little spam I still
get, I save to a spam folder.  Every once in a while, I do a 
"cat spam | bogofilter -Ns; rm -f spam".

Here's the tail-end of my procmailrc:

Message-ID: <4811.216.99.218.67.1069557393.squirrel@sautez.com>

hello all.

I was working on some DNS work and notice that there is an entry for
AAAA records that would resolve IP6 formated IPs.

So, my question is...

If I used IP6 on my network and put both IP4 and IP6 entries in the
DNS would all machines be able to resolve them?  Or is it not really
possible sense the outside world as a whole doesn't do IP6 addresses?

Just was curious.

Thanks,

Josh

Oh, so you have trouble with PDXLUG vs. PLUG too, huh?

(Just kidding! Not another god damn flamefest, please!)

I usually like to use List-Id headers instead, because the To: can be
unreliable (some people *cough* like to CC mail to the list, for some
reason, and then you have some lists that have multiple addresses...):

:0
* List-Id:.*pdxlug\.pdxlug\.org
.PDXLUG/

Assuming the list manager in use is injecting the headers, you can
basically always rely on them being there, no matter how it gets to
the list... :-)

On a sidenote, why do some people use :0: instead of :0? I'm a total
procmail n00b, and the example I happened to use for guidance was the
latter...
What's the difference?

Blatently stolen from a posting on slashdot:

Here's what's going to happen after February 21:

~    * You're going to get tons of spam, and from major companies. This
~      becomes legal, even in states where it used to be illegal.

~    * The spam won't necessarily have the company name, just some
~      unsubscribe URL and a P.O. box for written "opt-out" requests.
~    * You can go through the motions of "opting out", but it won't do

Yes. Even if the law does good in the U.S., we can't really enforce
spam comfing from other countries. Even if the spammer is in the US,
and the exploited server is in another contry, it'll be work to trace
it back, and in some cases, we won't be able to trace it back (due to
uncooperative foreign admins).

It'll be a large database of good e-mail addresses that foreign
spammers (and spammers who are savvy hijacking unprotected servers in
countries that don't care, or have spam-friendly providers) will be
able to exploit.

I, for one, won't be signing up.

However, I've got one of the ethN devices aliased across several IP

Anyone know the best way (or any good way (... or any bad way!)) to do
that?

The best way, afaik, is to use pass-through rules in iptables, and get
statistics from there. Inspect "iptables -L -n -v", you'll notice packet/
byte counts per rule passed through. Just create a rule with -i and/or
-o parameters for the interface and/or alias in question with no action,
and it will count for you.

But under generally accepted practices, process multiprogramming is
generally safer, and standardization makes it fairly simpler. 

Besides, you didn't address standardization. :-) I've had friends pass
along code from OSX, as one example, that wouldn't compile on Linux and
vice-versa, because of subtle differences in thread libraries. Never
seen that with any modern POSIX system vis-a-vis processes.

Too true, too true.

Although, for the record, -p is a bashism and is non-portable to other
POSIX-like shells. No reason not to use it in particular, it is certainly
more elegant, but be aware in case it breaks on a non-GNU system and
you can't figure out why. Be safe: use #!/bin/bash instead of #!/bin/sh

Bind 8.4 is the newest 8.x bind I have.  I don't want to use
Redhat 6.2's and I can't because I'm chrooting a and running 
two dns servers b.  I need dns compiled to two different 
paths, unless there's an easier way to do dual dns chrooted.

Figures, I had problems with qmail which comes from a similar 
source.  Everyone's documentation with source code seems to 
stink.  For starters, a list of the languages used would help
me determine what compilers and interpreters are needed.
The problem with binaries is not knowing the 
assumptions that have been made, many binaries cannot 
be easily convinced to behave differently without a 
recompile.  Bind 8.4 is one of these programs.

What needs to happen is important places need to move to setting
their dns and mail systems up in such a way that spam is easier
to fight.  We should move to a content cannot be accepted unless
a certain secret sequence is sent via an encrypted message which
I the receiver produce and provide if I really want to to the 
content provider.  After this, making sure no U.S. public site 
has an email system where affective verification techniques that 
the originator is legit won't work will help too.  To get the
get a receipt from me to send me email with a message body  
working, mailman etc. probably need to be changed.  The latter
also means email needs to be allowed as subject only.  
Someone can offend you with a subject line.  Kept 
to clear text only, that should stop malicious code 
attacks through email messages which are only
a subject line...

The level of access anyone has to anyone is arguably hurting 
our society at this point.  How may stories do we hear now 
about high tech teens getting picked up by kidnappers?  How 
about that weird taser to the back of a woman case where the 
word Jesus was carved?  To think she expressed this
as a fantasy to some stranger over the Internet is 
astounding. It has become a criminal case after he actually 
did it to her.  Maybe the idea of limiting oneself will 
become important again.  

The spam to a certain degree, especially the viagra ads 
in my opinion, are a form of assault.  An assault till 
you want to buy it.  Regardless of the consequences of
buying into the practice promiscuity argument a lot of 
spam pushes, Viagra ads are pushed at very high volumes.  
Other we will charge you for sexual images or products
spam is going out in high volume too.  Then there are 
the get rich ads, a lot of these are funny because they 
ask for cash to be sent in the mail claiming you won't 
get them twice.  Are prisoners producing some of this?
Organized crime?

The sex ads problem is on television too.  I'm dismayed
a standard broadcast network ever allowed someone to 
buy time to show a teenage group engaged in orgies on 
broadcast television.  Noone has to pay for broadcast 
tv, it was traditionally cleaner than the cable or 
satellite alternatives. There seemed to be a standard 
that saw zero orgies on it, zero hard core.  The sexual 
attitudes displayed at any time on broadcast television 
these days bother me.  I don't care that much for the 
news either.  Even OPB with all the advertising it has 
these days and consistently strong political bias 
frequently offends me.  UPN and Fox in my opinion 
are trying to be the worst on purpose.  I think some 
of these spammers are Fox's and UPN's sponsors.  It's
alarming how bad spam and broadcast television are
right now.

When the headers are correct what keeps the receiving MTA from rejecting
spam? Seems to me as soon as advertisers identify themselves at delivery
the technology to reject them at the door step will be made available to
the public pretty fast. Currently it is limited to those who have the
expertise and time to set up something like MIMEDefang.

I think it'll bring in campaign comtributions from the Direct Marketing
Association and show up as a bullet-point in lots of re-election
campaigns.  It will also have no effect on egregious spam.

Some day, the FBI will actually go after the criminals who write and
distribute email worms for the purpose of sending spam, hosting spam
websites and DDOSing antispam resources.  I'm not holding my breath.

That still drops the problem into the recipient's hands. We're still 
subsidizing the spammer. All that bandwidth they're sucking up is paid 
for by someone else.  All the steps we take to block spam eats up hours 
we'll never get paid for. What our good chums in Congress are doing is 
legalizing a form of DDoS. But what do they care, us luser citizens 
don't pad their bank accounts.

As for identifiable headers, you know they'll play whack-a-mole games 
with changing names and servers. Most retailers that get into the spam 
gang will outsource to the big spamhauses, who are experts at this sort 
of fiddle. It should be easier to filter, but it will still be a big 
fat PITA.

The cure for spam is to cut it off at the source. No matter how they 
dress it up, it's a form of trespass,that shifts the cost to the 
recipients. Building better filters, or making it easier to filter, is 
like using a bigger umbrella in a shitstorm.

I can't say I've read the bill yet, but I haven't heard of any
provision which requires something like Adv: in the subject line.

Correct headers is not necessarily equal to identification. And none
of this matters still when it comes to spam coming from overseas.

Which will make legitimate spam unprofitable, since nobody will ever
recieve it, leading people to simply disobey the law, or find
loopholes (like changing their name every other message).

Sure, that's what is required in California. I haven't read it either
but some standard marker in the header is what I expect from a "correct
header". 

> Correct headers is not necessarily equal to identification. And none

I meant identify as spam. Not identifying the identity of the sender. I
really don't care who tried to send the spam my server rejects.

Well, if they have to break the law to get around it that law seems to
do the work. Changing the name won't help if they obey the law and mark
the header.

You are right, Carla, it does not eliminate the problem and leaves the
recipient with a whole lot of work. 

That may be an acceptable trade-off though, when you consider the
alternative is *disallowing* to send information. That's a pretty sever
step because it will not be easy to decide which information is save to
send and what will get you prosecuted. I like the compromise of still
allowing to advertise, but with proper declaration.

  I wonder, .... Are there penalties for spamming in the bill?

  I ask because I have come up with an idea to fight fax spam. You know that
the fax spammers do not send the originating telephone number and they make
themselves very difficult to identify. This despite the federal laws against
fax spams. While I have spent some time tracking down a couple of spammers
and sending them letters demanding money (per the law), I've not received
any yet. (However, a local lawyer has, but his letterhead probably conveys
more threat than does mine.)

  What I am ramping up to do is an attempt to do just this for the fax spam.
I am sending copies of the spam to the companies being promoted. I will tell
them that because they contracted with (and paid) an illegal spam factory
that I cannot identify I am holding them responsible. I will ask for the
penalties under both the anti-fax-spam law and the do-not-call list (yes, my
fax number is on there, too). I will tell them that if I do not receive
payment in a certain period, I will file in Multnomah County Small Claims
Court for triple damages. They will need to hire a local lawyer or lose by
default.

  Also, I will inform them, I will post their company name and illegal
advertising practices on the Web with the advice that people neither buy
their stock or their products/services. Perhaps someone already has such a
Web site set up.

  Targeting the clients who hire spammers (fax or e-mail) has the best
potential for doing something about it. Harnessing the reach and power of
the 'Net to hurt them financially has a higher probability of success.

  Anyone want to join me in this effort?

Kyle, I can't figure out how to record with it. I don't see a way to
open a URL and when hearing to the radio using Realplayer hitting the
"Record" key nothing is recorded. Recording device is /dev/dsp.

I used it to record an FM broadcast from the line in, but from the FAQ, it 
looks like it's do-able

http://audacity.sourceforge.net/faq.php
-----------------------------------------------

5. Can I record RealAudio or other streaming audio?

Not automatically. Most streaming audio, including most music delivered to 
the RealOne Player, Windows Media Player, and Quicktime, is specifically 
designed to prevent you from recording it.

Still, it's almost always still possible to record anything your computer 
can play by looping your sound-out jack to your sound-in/microphone jack on 
your computer's sound card.

Use a 1/8 inch stereo mini to 1/8 inch stereo mini cable. Connect one end to 
the sound-out jack on your computer or sound card (where you would plug 
speakers or headphones - it's often colored green). Connect the other end to 
the microphone or line-in jack (it's often colored red).

Now Audacity can record anything your computer plays. Press Record in 
Audacity, and then press Play in your streaming audio program.

-------------

I wonder if you could tap (tee?) /dev/dsp and forgo the cable?

Message-ID: <1069613160.2445.12.camel@halo>

Hi, here is a question - again:

I would like to run an x window session on a remote box. Reason: the
user on the remote box tells me the screen "flashes" but when I run
single X applications through x forwarding I see nothing wrong. In an
attempt to replicate this from remote I shut down my x window (init 3),
log into the remote computer with the user's account (ssh -X
user at remote) and type startx. Then this error message comes up: "PAM
authentication failed. Cannot start x server. Perhaps you do not have
console ownership?" Remote is RH9, mine is RH8. 

A quick look at google tells me there is much more involved to get this
to run. 

Is there a good how-to or recipe?

Thanks - again

Actually you can, if (for example) you can get a copy of the LD_PRELOAD 
library "vsound".  That library puts a wrapper around the open, etc. 
system calls that lets you substitute a file or potentially another file 
descriptor for the file /dev/dsp.

I currently use it (along with the simple command line player from 
Real's HelixDNA project) to access a couple RealAudio internet radio

Unfortunately, you are wrong. The law legitimizes and legalizes spam
that meets certain conditions (ADV: subject, real headers, etc.)... At
least how I understand it. IANAL.

So legally legitimate spam will be unprofitable (because everyone will
filter it) and it won't take long for people to go back to illegal
illegitimate spam (if they ever switch in the first place, that is).

Fantastic, it works! Actually I was just installing vsound when you sent

This is DUMB DUMB DUMB.

Do you realize the tool of abuse you're becoming?

If you get other people to join in this with you, you will be like a DDOS
trojan waiting to be sprung.

If I want to wreak havoc for, say, Home Depot, I could just fax spam a
bunch of people who have signed up on your little self-righteous crusade
with a Home Depot flyer.  BOOM!  You guys fly into action and I sit back
and laugh.

This is the same as limits on campaign spending.  While I appreciate the
idea, the approach is really poor.  I can't wait for some wise-ass rich
guy to spend a million dollars on a campaign like "Vote for Howard Dean.
He finished the fourth grade! -- Paid for by the Committee To Elect
Howard Dean, Fourth Grade Graduate."  Negative ads disguised as positive
ads.  It's going to happen quite soon.

[Of course, the CORRECT approach is to ban all private advertisement and
use public funds to pay for equal time/position for each registered
candidate in each medium... but that won't fly as long as money rules the
day. -- This should be followed up on plug-talk, of course.]

And is there any reason why all this spam talk is somehow magically
ON-topic to all you folks who bitch about off-topic posts?  Perhaps plug
could sponsor a spam-discuss list (plug-spam?) in order to divert some of
this crud from the inbox of those who have better things to do than sludge
through email on this topic.

  Just because the law mandates how spam is to appear to the recipient, it
is still Unsolicited Commercial E-mail. While the format will, perhaps, be
blessed by Congress, it is still UCE and, therefore, spam by those who do
not wish to receive UCE.

  Unfortunately, when one steps through the looking glass into Regulatory
Land, all logic and rationality must be suspended. Like the Cheshire Cat
says, "things are what I say they are, no more and no less". Unless you can
emotionally distance yourself from the complete irrationality you risk
injuring yourself with frustration.

Subject: [PLUG] server up and down.
Message-ID: <2892.216.99.218.67.1069624311.squirrel@sautez.com>

Hello all,

I'm having my computer go up and down.  I can do a ping to the server
and it responds really fast then it stops for like 15-30 secs then
goes again for 1-2min.

What can I do to test the server and see where this is coming from?

I had it all lock up a while back b/c of the HD being disconnected.  I
plan to replace this server soon with a new one but if there is
something I can fix for the next two weeks that would be great.  I
just backed up the server files.

I can get on the machine for a moment then kicked off so any FAST test
would be ideal. ;-)  I'll be in front of the machine tomorrow but any
remote test tools?  Suggestions?

Thanks for the help.


Josh

Still, I'm very glad the ADV: is required.  That's key.  Though the bill establishes a formal opt-out system (among other obvious flaws), the subject tag provides the means to opt-in instead.

The spam problem (for the 99% of us who think of it as such) calls for both a legislative and a technical solution, the goal of which is to make spamming, if not unprofitable for spammers, at least inexpensive to the rest of us.  The more spam I can channel out of my inbox, the closer we come to both goals.

Message-ID: <2977.216.99.218.67.1069626474.squirrel@sautez.com>

Good day.

So, I think I want to replace my system hard drive.

I have two HD in the sysem.  One is for the OS and some other minor
things and the other is mostly home dirs and files.

I think the system drive is going bad and want to do a complete move
from the old HD of 30GB to a new HD of 120GB.  Beside attaining a copy
of Ghost what alternatives do I have?  I know I'll have to take the
computer off line and boot from a floppy to move the drive but not
sure how to do it.

My first guess is to use dd but not familiar with that well enough to
know if that is the best tool for the job.

Suggestions?  I want to be able to take the computer offline for a
short time.  Mount the other HD.  Reboot on a floopy, run a command to
move the contents from the old drive to the new.  Take out the old
drive and boot up with the new drive.  The Old OS and all files should
still be there.  hmm,  Will there be partition problems?  Or just
extra space I can repartition later?

Thanks again.

Josh

Having two drives does make things easier because you can leave the 
second drive alone.

You might want to consider doing a fresh install on the new drive.

dd only works if the filesystems are exactly the same.  I have found 
that "cp -a" works fine.  There is also a piped tar command that people 
use to copy files.

The way I would do it is:

1. Backup system files onto second hard drive.  /etc, list of packages, 
/root

2. Put in the new hard drive.  Boot to old drive or floppy.

3. Partition new drive.  Copy files from old drive to new drive.

4. Swap old drive and new drive and maybe remove old drive.  Boot to new 
drive.

Don't know about the bind 8.4 capatible but it does follow the (or mostly

experience with tinydns - Ed's the one in the know on this.
   I do run dnscache for two caching nameservers it it runs as dnscache 
(and dnslog for the logging function).  These currently are _VERY_ lightly 
loaded servers so I can't attest to their performance under load but they 
are much smaller (code wise) than bind and do a specific task - answer DNS 
queries.

Well, many of us here maintain email servers on Linux.  Spam bears upon such systems directly (not to mention on almost every other modern computer system).

Sometimes your hypocrisy impresses me, Brelin.  I certainly haven't time to go back and tally up the number of your OT posts, but apply any cast-the-first-stone metaphor here.

I think spam is very relevant to a Linux discussion list, thanks.

Well, I was just formally bringing up something that has come up
informally on many occassions (particularly at meetings and such when
folks are idly discussing list topics).

Spam seems to be the pet topic of three or five list members who go on and
on about it.  I don't think a day goes by without a thread on the subject
among those four folks... usually comprising a dozen or so messages.

I'm just suggesting that we set up a forum where that sort of talk can be
discussed at great length, since it seems to be of primary concern to this
minority.

I'm certainly not the only one who doesn't care to read about it.

So should I mark you down as one against?

I'm trying to use a CGI form to send three values to a

sometimes I get 

host=eagle.robinson-west.com&pass=bogusbogus&a=on.

I'm using a <FORM> tag with three <INPUT> tags and an 
<INPUT> tag for submit and clear form.  Is the <button> 
tag better?  I'm using text fields.  I can't do it all 
in buttons unless I implement a couple roller buttons 
for the password with all the hosts in a long radio 
list.  When I get the input as one instead of three 
values, is there an easy way to break it down into 
it's pieces?

Another problem I'm running into with my perl script
using NetEasyTCP is that I need to be able to open
a connection to multiple servers where some may not
be up.  These servers are meant to provide redundancy 
for each other, I should be able to turn one off and 
have the client script still work.  What do I need 
to do instead of: 

client -> send ( ... ) || die; 
client -> receive ( ... ) || die;

What do you mean by "three values?" That looks like three values to me:

host = eable.robinson-west.com
pass = bogusbogus
a = on

It's three values sent as one string that has to be broken apart.
Only some of the browsers I have send it this way, others
post it as three seperate strings which is much easier to work
with...  Is there a standard behavior or not for this?  How can
I break this apart with a perl script?

I'm no perl guru, but I think it would be pretty easy to replace the
ampersands with line breaks.  I'm pretty sure I could do this with C++. 
Might even be able to do it with bash.  But I really don't know enough
perl to pull it off at this stage of the game.

That is, if replacing the ampersands with line breaks is all you really
need to do.  I that's just the way you're typing it here... then sorry
for the wasted email.  :-)

Pipe it through sed?

I think perl's CGI library would be worth looking into... it makes
this sort of thing a lot easier.

Learning perl has a chapter on CGI.

Well, if I can find the right way to execute a non perl command
like sed in the client perl CGI script, I should be able to  break 
the long line and assign the pieces off.  I've executed other non 
perl commands.  I think there are some bugs in my script overall. 
Lining parentheses up in the way that looks correct oddly breaks it.
I thought all variables were global in perl.  Maybe my subroutines 
need to be defined within the main function to give all the variables 
global scope.

Jeme,

    (1) I liked your posting.  I am generally uneasy about new laws
        in part because of laws tend to have many unintended consequences.
        I'm afraid that any anti-spam legislation could possibly ban a lot
        of legitimate communication, while encouraging at least some
        of the spam the legislation is aimed at.

    (2) Thus, I tend to think the best solutions to our spam problems are
        technical.

    (3) In terms of getting a PLUG-spam or PLUG-email list, we create one
        if people wanted.  Do you think there would be enough long term
        interest in such a list to justify it.  Personally, I wouldn't
        limit the list to discussion of spam; but rather expand it to
        any mail problems including technical discussions of potential
        solutions.

                                          Sincerely,
                                          David Mandel

FWIW, that sounds like a decent idea to me.  I would subscribe to a
PLUG-email list.

Also, FWIW, I really didn't think the Anti-Spam Bill was all that
off-topic, especially considering the amount of spam-related email to
flow through the list in the last few months.  I'd say as much as spam
*does* relate to what we do with our computers in Linux, it's fairly on
topic, although definitely more broad than just Linux/Unix stuff.

Just my two cents.

Rob

Well, if such is your intent, then point taken.  But you understand, that spam bill just made the news again, being very close to passing; so I think some tolerance on the subject is in order, whatever your interest in it.

As for the separate list, I'll reiterate what others have said:  not a bad idea, but I'm afraid it wouldn't work.  We already have at least a dozen plug-* lists, but only PLUG itself gets any real traffic.  (I've posted questions/suggestions on plug-web recently, but no one's reading, so no one has replied.)  PLUG has readers, and that means an audience to many people.  Hence all the OT cruft.

How about plug-legal? That's the bit that was 'off-topic' here, right?
And it seems like the topic comes up (vis-a-vis Oregon Open Source law,
et. al.).

Me too.

In my opinion the spam discussion is relevant for Linux activists for
these reasons:

1) A good part of us administer Linux servers and spam is part of the
task.

2) Spam in a way 'helps' us as it increases the awareness of the average
user. IT, software, the operation system is getting more media
bandwidth. We need this recognition, especially when we promote a system
that cannot be consumed as easily as the mainstream fast food system.
When IT runs in the background without any ripples people will take it
for granted and reduce its priority. This will also affect the budget. 

3) One reason why I am attracted by Linux is the freedom of choice,
freedom of using more control over the technology I am working with many
hours a day. New laws that reduce the freedom of distributing
information scare me. In my country, not too long ago, law has burned
books and banned information, free speech. Sure, a spam law is meant for
"bad" information. Problem is how to define "bad". You leave control
over deciding what is "bad" to people who may have a different
definition of "bad". Maybe not today, but such a law can be used as a
door opener in the future. For that reason I am generally oppose
outlawing the distribution of information, unless it supports a crime or
collides with the constitution. 

4) In 3) I explain that, for me, making spam a crime is a drastic
measure. I don't see the necessity. Others have pointed out the problem
can be controlled with technology. And labor. Which may work for the
administrators in our group (no, not me). 

5) Why is spam such a big deal? Last week I posted to this group why it
is not a problem for me. I control it with SpamAssassin and a few other
rather easy techniques and receive such a small number of spam mails
that I don't even get annoyed. I use Linux for this. If it works with
our toolset we should see this as a chance to deliver superior
technology on Linux to get a handle on this problem. Not that you
couldn't do this on Windows servers. But now there is a race to deliver
working solutions to this problem, and open source solutions are holding
a pretty good position in this race. People are annoyed and a working
solution will get their attention. 

6) The spam problem is often mixed and confused with security. Sometimes
with reason, when spam also delivers a virus. Security has a huge
potential to change the IT landscape with a momentum we may not have
expected a few months back. And security talk tends to work to the
advantage of Linux. 

7) We are talking about technology here, right? Well, however the
society deals with spam, technology will be the most important component
in any solution. As was pointed out by others, a US law to ban spam will
still keep enough spam coming from other countries. So, lets work on the
technology to solve this problem. 

Thus, a triple hip hip hurray on spam! ;)

Sorry for the long ramble, normally not my style.

If you are calling sed from within perl, you really shouldn't be using
perl.  I mean, that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

No offense, but judging from the level of knowledge your question belies,
I'd say there has to be.

Are you using an editor that helps you with this?

No.  And some of the scoping can be a real hassle unless you explicitly
narrow everything to where it is declared.

use strict;

perldoc strict

I think you don't know how perl works.  There are lots of good tutorials,
but I happen to like Programming Perl.  It's a fine book.

For this purpose, you should certainly be using the perl CGI library.
While it's not always necessary for simple applications, it might help you
to deal with things that you're finding difficult.

use CGI;

Add all that up, and your CGI script should start like this:

#! /usr/bin/perl -wT

use strict;
use CGI;

Got it?

Actually, I just think all the spam talk is limited to a certain
consistent sub-group and generally not at all related to technical unix
stuff or software issues relating to Free Software, merely open source
software, or unix.

It's a bit like discussing where we get our MP3s versus how we decode,
normalize, or sort them.

There are software issues related to spam and freedom issues related to
spam and those are very much what folks on this list wanted when they
signed up, but most of the discussion on this topic is neither.  It's just
a bunch of people talking about which headers they use to try and strike
back and their perceived transgressors and talk about how many messages
they get and so on.

Oh, I think that's all right at home on the main list.

I've never heard of this behavior before. Granted, I'm not deeply

| Is there a standard behavior or not for this?


Yes. The CGI/1.1 spec.

http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/

| How can I break this apart with a perl script?
|

The painfully obvious way is:


grishnav at egosurf cgi-bin $ perl
$test = "a=b&1=2&4=3";

my %hash;
my @array = split(/&/,$test);
for (@array) {
~        my ($name, $value) = split(/=/);
~        $hash{$name} = $value;
}
print "$hash{'a'}\n\n";
^d
b

grishnav at egosurf cgi-bin $


But the better way is:

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use CGI qw/:standard/;

my $password = param('password') or die ("stfu\n");
my $a - param('a') or die ("End users suck\n");

[...]


And the even better way is to use the OO version of the above (if
you're mind has been warped in the ways of OO, that is):

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use CGI qw/:standard/;

my $q = new CGI;

my $password = $q->param('password');
my $a = $q->param('a');

[...]

Right!  I don't get that either.  I use SpamAssassin and it's just plain
not an issue.  SpamAssassin works.  So what's the problem?

With SpamAssassin I get maybe unsolicited messages each day in a box that
I read.  I run a simple grep on the mbox containing the spam to check the
spam scores (and for my name and stuff) and delete 'em based on some
simple criteria.

In the real world, on Unix and unix-like systems this isn't much of an
issue.

Why in the HELL would you want to execute SED from a perl script?

You can execute with backticks, or system(), and open().
`sed -e "blah"`;
system("sed -e \"blah\"");
open(SED,"sed -e \"blah\" |");

But why? Anything sed can do, perl can do better.

Consider the following:

cat randfile | sed -e 's/field/b/'

perl:

cat randfile | perl -ne 's/field/b/; print;'

They will produce the exact same output.

Has this machine demonstrated uptime with other operating systems (e.g.,
Windows)? i.e., is this a hardware issue?

I've not yet dived into the realm of socket programming, in Perl (or
any other language, for that matter).

However, here's a stab in the dark:

client -> send ( ... );
client -> recieve (...);

If you don't tell your script to die, it (generally) won't. Write a
subroutine that handles the error (prints a warning, logs it,
whatever) and move on.

client -> send (...) or &failure("$!");
client -> recieve (...) or &failure("$!");

Only a Linux server from day one.  I haven't changed any Hardware but
I think the Hard drive may be going bad.  My only thought is that the
swap partition is bad and thus it tries to write something and fails.

Is there some way to test for that?  Can I create another swap like a
file since I can't make another partition now.  I knew in HP you could
add to the swap space by defining a file then make that file the
primary swap.  Not very efficient but worked.  Anything similar for
linux?

Howabout swapoff?  Then mkswap -c /dev/whatever-your-swap-partitition-is

The -c causes mkswap to check for bad blocks.

Or alternatively use a floppy based Linux system like Tom's Root
Boot, comment the swap partition out, then reboot.  Any time a format
or partition command is used there is a high likely of wiping out the
wrong thing.

Yes, it is possible to create one using a loop-back files system.  I
don't remember exactly how, but it should be in your docs, or How-To's
somewhere.

Have you tried booting Knoppix, yet?  If it still reboots, then you
should start unplugging things until you can get something to stay up. 
Bad RAM might do this too, memtest86 is the tool for that.

Good Luck,

Excellent, Derek. This removes software as the issue. I really suspect

I'm spoiled and I want use somebody else's holidays calendars. Google
tells me that ICS files are supported, a quick check tells me that it's
an import option.

I found:
http://www.apple.com/ical/library/holidays.html

Cool. Someone has done lots of calendars, and I can download them here. 

Whoah- My browser won't do it. Konqueror and Mozilla seem to have a
built in association that prevents me from just downloading the file. 

I cannot find this association, where is it?

Is there a better way to import a calendar?

I couldn't do this test last night.  I downloading Knoppix now but the
machine has now been up for 5 hrs. No idea yet as to why.


Things I have tried.

1. swapoff; mkswap -c /dev/hda7; swapon
  This reports no errors.

Question about swap.  If I don't have it on will things maybe not work
if they need space or will it just swap in ram?  It appears in top
that it barely if at all touches swap.  Like hardly used.  So, I could
rule partition of swap out I think.

2. I ran rsync last night on my important files to my other drive as a
backup.  I had forgotten that I actually had lots of files in one
directory and it was going to take forever so I went to sleep.  I wake
this morning and it is up and working.  Could this had caused
something to work?  Odd if you ask me but maybe not if you think the
HD is going bad.

Well, that is all I did and it is up.  I'm going to go build a new
server to replace this one.  I don't want it down and have to do
everything hot.  Things are going well and no one has reported a
problem.

I did find a site to build a system while the other is up and hot.
Good information and can do it remotely:
http://www.owlriver.com/tips/rsync-cookbook/

Any more test or suggestions I can do while the system is up and not
have to take services offline?

Thanks,

Josh

I realize you seem to have ruled out a bad swap partition, so this may
not be much help... but is a worthy tip for folks, regardless.

To use a swap file instead of a swap partition, or in addition to (you
can create these on the fly if you find you need more swap in the middle
of something)... 

dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/swap/file bs=1M count=n
...where n is the number of megabytes you want the swap file to be.

mkswap /path/to/swap/file
swapon /path/to/swap/file

...and bam, you've got more swap.

  AKA. the MACH micro-kernel.  AKA. FreeBSD

From: 
http://developer.apple.com/darwin/history.html

 "Darwin also incorporates a full implementation of BSD (Berkeley Software
Distribution) UNIX, welded on top of the Mach kernel. The hybrid BSD
architecture adopted by Darwin embodies its historical association with the
BSD code base and underscores both the project's strong relationship with
the various BSD organizations and its strong cultural affinity with the open
source developer community. Indeed, Darwin itself constitutes a full-blown
operating system, complete in and of itself, made available as open source
by Apple -- a fact that's both astonishing and under-appreciated. 

Darwin is comprised of five main components: the Mach microkernel and BSD
subsystem, the file system, networking, and the I/O Kit."

  Darwin is a fine OpenSource project.  I'd like to play with it sometime,
*if* I can find some cheap hardware to run it on.

The URLs on that page are all webcal:// stuff.  If you replace the
webcal:// with http:// and use wget, you can download the files to disk

I do believe Darwin compiles under x86.... I know it used to, I almost
went and got it, but I decided I didn't need another OS on my system.

I know I'd definitely have some Apple hardware if the stuff wasn't so
darned expensive.

Just did something like that: copied the URL into a new browser, changed

CGI.pm is your friend.

	use CGI.pm;

	my $SignUp = new CGI;
	my %SignUpInfo;

	my @PARAMS = $SignUp->param;

	map {$SignUpInfo{$_} = $SignUp->param($_)} @PARAMS;

And you have these three or any number of new ones.

This is what I am currently using since the number of variables seems to 
be cancerous and growing from within the CGI script also not just from the 
HTML page and form.  :-(

Subject: [PLUG] Promise drive controller
Message-ID: <20031124201033.84526.qmail@web9606.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi, it's me again. Anyhow I purchased a 160-GB hard
drive that was too large for my BIOS to support, and
installed an offboard drive controller for that
reason. Windows XP has a driver for this controller
and installed it without any trouble. And that's
saying quite a bit, in view of XP's notorious driver
problems. 

And what about Red Hat 9.0? Promise Technology's Web
site offers drivers for this card, but when I followed
their instructions, including kernel parameters, the
drive was not recognized. Then I tried the
installation without their assistance, and the drive
was recognized, though as hde. The installation
program was already beginning to install packages into
newly-created ext3 partitions when it encountered
problems and gave up. 

Could it be media problems, or inadequate support for
the Promise controller? I made the disks myself,
though they passed the md5sum check and the additional
media check that Red Hat provides. I would be willing
to try another distribution, if that is more likely to
succeed--including, of course, Fedora, which I have
not yet downloaded. I would be particularly interested
in hearing from people who have distributions
successfully installed with such RAID controllers.

How about power management?  I have trouble where sometimes my Pentium
III's won't boot when it's on in the bios and sometimes they won't boot
when it's off.  It's probably the messiest idea next to the serial and
parallel ports that is on the modern PC.  It's arguably better to make
devices use less power to operate than it is to try to make them power
manage, especially if they're always busy and never idle.  Another big
one to look for that is often not obvious is what your parallel port
is set to in bios, setting it to ECP or standard appears to be much 
safer than setting it to EPP.  I've seen windows boxes run for a while
and crash because of the parallel port setting.  I suspect there's a
bug between EPP mode and power management, but I'm not sure.

Message-ID: <20031124205851.56888.qmail@web42003.mail.yahoo.com>

'Rank newbie here, having had lots of fun configuring a PCI hardware controlled modem in Mandrake 9.1 The modem is a USR 5610b, using the TI designed 'Kermit' chipset.  At one point, I got it running & online, but shortly thereafter, it adopted the 'I'm gonna connect at only 14K' syndrome. So far, most how to's speak of port locations, interrupts, etc. I find that the first seven ports are occupied by com & graphics adapters, resident on the Motherboard. When the setup dialogue box appears in mandrake controll for the networking components, it would seem to assume it must be either ttys0 thru ttys3. My last successful connection was using ttys6. 
 
I look forward to becoming fluent w/ all the log reports & commands that show what's going on, and hope to join in the next mtg. Any help would be appreciated.

Hi,

Had a box do this after a few years.  Turned out I'd selected a power
supply that was barely adequate (250W for 2 SCSI drives, 2 CDs, lots of
cards).  I pulled a hard drive and it went back to reliable operation.  Put
the drive back, bumped the power supply by a hundred watts and all is well.

Cheers,
Mike

Message-ID: <BAY9-F35rnhH6kSCjGR000118aa@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

I noticed that under RH9, Systems Setting -> Display, you can configure
quite a few things about your video card.  My card, Riva TNT2 allows for
hardware acceleration which I could not get it to function under RH9 no 
matter
what I try.

I just put in Fedora on another system with the same graphics card.
Under the same menu option, (System Setting -> Display), I seem
to get almost no option to configure my graphics card setting.

Does Fedora has a way for me to configure my graphics card?

Thanks

You'll have to edit your XF86Config manually, I'm afraid. <insert ritual

The problem here is less in the gui tools than in the drivers.
Nvidia driver which ships with XFree (and the only one RH configurator
knows about) does not do hardware acceleration. If you install the NVidia
driver, it does everything. I don't know if after you install it the
cgui will notice that you now have all these options.

I run RH9 and have a Riva TNT2 card also. I had no problems at all with
the installation or the driver. You might want to check the memory on
your card and make sure it matches what RH9 thinks you have...I've
noticed it does get it wrong at times (ie, thinks I have 8MB when I
really have 32MB)

Which version.  I just started noticing this on the WinXP system I _have_
to use at work last week when dealing with pdf files.  It got so bad this
morning I decided I should try an upgrade and in a fix of madness upgraded
to 1.6a.  Still no joy and a few more problems.  I uninstalled some damn
MS Multimedia updat and downgraded to Mozilla 1.5 but still no joy.  Then
I shut OpenOffice.org off and things started running fairly well.  While
working on a web application I suddenly notice tables were not displaying
correctly.  They use CSS.  When I finally got them looking almost correct 
again I found on the next page that optgroup's dont work.  Can't wait to 
get home tonight and back to my Linux box.  I don't feel upto getting 
involved in Bugzilla to report this.  If anyone know of a developer that 
will take anadotal reports let me know.

Now I'm trying to get back to Mozilla 1.4 but haven't found it on the site 
yet.  It really tees me off when IE works and Mozilla doesn't!

Did it say anything before giving up?

Was it able to boot the kernel from the harddrive?

How did you configure the card's BIOS?

What kernel version is RH9 using?

How did you partition the drive?

Subject: [PLUG] RAID 1 suggestions
Message-ID: <4437.216.99.218.67.1069737763.squirrel@sautez.com>

Hello,

With my constantly rebooting system, which seems to have resolved
itself over night, I have decided to rebuild a new system.  It has
been 4-5 years of it running well and I think one drive is not doing
well.

This lead me to think about running RAID 1 as a cheap backup.  I read
about Motherboards with the promise bios RAID built into them.  I have
also used MD in Linux once or twice to setup one RAID system for
afternoon(okay it was like 2 days) fun.

Does anyone know which is better?  Will the bios system give better
support and be faster?  Will I even notice the difference?  I have
priced a system that will do for my needs for around $500.  I could
save a few dollars using MD but if the extra cash increases
proformance I would spend the money.

Suggestions?

Thanks,

Josh

Message-ID: <000001c3b319$b92bb6f0$6401a8c0@laptop>

I've got a soyo motherboard with the onboard promise lite RAID 0/1
capability. I set it up with RAID 0 (presumably for gaming performance
on windows) and have regreted it every day since. I would have much
rather done onboard RAID 1 and more or less rid myself of backup
hassles. 

This board actually has 4 IDE channels: 2 for RAID 0 or 1 configuration
(colored black) and 2 others just cause (colored blue). So you can use
the black IDE channels for raid (one drive on each - chaining doesn't
work on these channels when using RAID) and the blue IDE channels for
other IDE devices (master/slave is fine). Making for a total of 6
devices. 

The bios also allows you to use the black channels as regular IDE
controllers if you don't want to do RAID. I'm not sure if this would
increase ide device capacity up to 8 or not, but it gives you more
channels than a regular motherboard, in either case.

At one point I wanted to do SW RAID 5 and from my research it seemed
that the performance hit, on a modern system, even in software, wasn't
enough to really make a difference. Given that, I wouldn't imagine that
RAID 1 would produce any noticeable delay*. 

If I had to do it again, I'd probably invest the time to learn md in
linux and remove any hw/vendor dependencies of using onboard raid. 

Hope that helps.

Is this perfectly sound?  I mean, it seems to be and I do it on my home
fileserver, but I'm wondering if someone who knows a hell of a lot about
such things would just agree without caveat or if there's something that
should be taken into account.

Well, the intuitive response is that the hardware implementation will be
faster and less drain on system resources, but that really depends, I
suppose, on exactly which hardware and how it's implemented.

I use Linux MD (software raid) RAID1 on an old P166 for an NFS server
(serving /home to every other machine) at the house and I can't say that
it's given me even the tiniest bit of trouble.  It's a bit slower than a
single local disk, but I think that the network has a heck of a lot more
to do with that than the RAID.

Oh, and I've had power outages and all kinds of weird things happen in the
last few years with no obvious ill effects.  It's reiserfs on RAID1.

I don't know what else I would want to take into account. Here is what
I'm trying to resolve:

1. Backups
2. Little but preferred no maintenance
3. Easy recovery

It just seemed that RAID 1 was a simple solution with little worries. 
The other option is to RSYN the drives minus the obvious /proc and
some others.  But this doesn't give you hot swap ability.  You would
have to turn off the drive do a lilo or other grub loader thingy and
then it would work again.  Maybe.

I guess that is why I thought RAID 1 was the best.  Then again maybe
there is something better.  I don't know about it, that is for sure.

Thanks for the commits.  Glad to hear your home system is running well.

Josh

It's sound, as long as you have a hard copy of the commands to run  to
change your mirrored disk to a single disk. 

I set my "gotta run" solaris boxes up with raid 1 boot drives. I keep a
copy of the instructions to unmirror the drive that survives a crash in
my filing cabinet. 

To safeguard against one taking out the other, and deleting the wrong
file, you should also have an off system backup.

I've been doing it for quite some time and have, in fact, returned a few
drives and replaced some here and there. And my data marches on. There's
some segments I wouldn't mind backing up, but I can't afford the kind of
media that would take. Any kind of data storage plan these days isn't so
straightforward as "buy a bunch of tape and back it up". In fact, in
some cases, for certain kinds of storage scenarios, you're better off
just backing it all up to a spare hard drive and putting it into a safe.
What's the point of spending $10,000 on a SuperDLT and/or Ultrium
storage solution just to store a bunch of email?

Not, actually. 99% of these on-board solutions are little more than boot
assistance and vendor lock-in. They don't do any computation whatsoever.
Look at the drivers in Linux. They all say "software" RAID for these
cards. You really are better off using md. Or a real hardware RAID
controller. The Adaptec aacraid driver appears that it may support newer
SATA controllers. I'm very happy with my 3ware. Or you can get any
number of SCSI RAID controllers. I've got an amazing DPT I've grown out
of up for sale. ;-) Plus hardware RAID takes all the headache out of
software RAID1 booting (which I've done in the past). BIOS RAID may
actually help on this one issue, surprisingly -- no experience, though.

I don't have time to go look it up, but jwz had an article on how he's
noticed that he hasn't done backups in years -- just migrated data from
machine to machine -- i.e., making sure the hardware's fresh every so
many generations.

I've been dinking around with user-mode linux recently.  I am using a
debian file system I believe I got from the user-mode linux site some
time ago (apt-get updated recently), as well as a 2.4.22-5um kernel I
got from Debian.  One curiosity is that _sometimes_ the boot stalls on
"Calculating module dependencies...".  If I press a key, it boots the
rest of the way.  Sometimes it goes all the way to a login prompt
without intervention.  Anyone know (hazard a guess) why?  It is sort
of annoying.  My startup script looks like:

  linux ubd0=guest_root_cow,root_fs umid=guest eth0=daemon,,,/var/run/uml-utilities/uml_switch.ctl con=pty con0=fd:0,fd:1

or sometimes:

If you happen to be any sort of entity that might be required to provide
backups to the courts that's a big point.  Current example would be 
the Mutual Funds and brokerage houses that were allowing after hours
trading.  The SEC is requesting several years of email archives.  These
businesses were also required to keep backups in the first place.  For
that matter there's a push for all IM traffic to be archvied.

BIND was not resolve this name. It's fairly common when you do a 
nslookup on a server and it doesn't find any DNS records for the domain 
name.

You're running bind (I assume it's bind) as a resolving name server and
somebody is trying to resolve socceramerica.net.  Something is fishy
with their DNS, however... I tried a 'host socceramerica.net' and got a
bunch of this in my logs:

Nov 25 08:26:13 linuxbox named[22616]: lame server resolving
'socceramerica.net' (in 'socceramerica.NET'?): 192.31.80.34#53

However, nothing rebooted on me.  :-)

This means that 192.42.93.34 advertized itself as having authoritative
information for domain socceramerica.net but in fact does not.
It's a problem in the remote server configuration, but nothing you need to
worry about.

If you don't want to see these messages, add this to your bind config
file:
logging {
category lame-servers { null; };
};

RAID is not a substitute for a good backup.  It cannot be taken
off-site, and the both hard drives are just as vulnerable to power
supply spikes or surges.  It can make for an easily recoverable system,
but don't rely on it for the only protection of your data.

Check out the article at Tom's Hardware Guide:

http://www.tomshardware.com/storage/20031114/raidcore-01.html

This gives a good overview of the current state of IDE RAID
controllers.  However, a real RAID controller (not a software RAID
controller like most of the Promise controllers) is going to blow that
$500 budget.

Real RAID is going to be faster, but to really get the performance out
of it, you will need to get the 10,000 RPM SATA drives, and the combo of
the drives and the controller will more than double your budget.

The linux software RAID is, IMO, better than the software RAID that the
Promise people have put together.  The tricky part is convincing your OS
to boot to the RAID device.  So far, I've avoided the issue by having
the OS reside on a 4 or 5 gig partition, and have /home and/or /var
mounted as RAID devices.  The OS partition is then rsync'ed to a
similiar sized partition on the second drive each night.

HTH,

Like I said, anymore it's not such a clear question. Anymore, you'll
have different grades of data and different backup strategies.

I'll second this.

The big reason for me not to rely on RAID as a backup is that mirroring
will dutifully mirror accidental deletes/changes.  Backups create a nice
point-in-time copy.  (The same could be done to an extra hard disk, but
that's just a backup to disk, not RAID...)

I use RAID as a means to avoid having to rebuild my system when a
hard drive dies.  It also ensures that when this happens I have zero data
loss.

I've not had any problems putting boot, root, and even swap on a software
RAID partition with RedHat 7 or newer.  The /boot partition needs separate
LILO and/or GRUB entries for each half of the mirror for easier booting
when one disk dies, but otherwise software mirroring is quite
straightforward.

I've had a hard time finding a way to do software mirroring on my Win2k
Professional system though.  Does anyone know of a free product that does
this? (preferably Open Source, but I'm not going to get my hopes up...)

How do I find out more about this? I'm interested in finding out how to
make it easier when one drive dies. I generally have enough stress at
that time, easier sounds better to me.

You may want to try the rootstrap tool first (apt-get install rootstrap)
which is designed to build your own custom, current Debian uml image.
Also of note, I believe you should use "con=pts" instead (at least it's
what I'm using ;-), and if you want it to fully "background" use
"con0=pts,fd:1" and watch the boot message carefully for the pts that
tty1 is mapped to. Then minicom in on that pts. (Though using fd:0 the
first few times might be easier :-D)

I use uml here extensively, though my disk and network configuration is
completely different from what you're using. I'm sure we can hammer
something out, eh? :-)

Unlike NT 3.5 and 4.0, Win2K/XP Pro have SW-RAID disabled in the
pro/workstation versions.  Silly, I know, but having Marketing make
weird technical decisions is par for the course with commercial s/w.

Three ways to get RAID:
1. Buy a RAID controller.  Even a cheapo pseudo-RAID controller will do,
since you wanted SW-RAID from the beginning.  You'll need to reinstall
everything to get it on the RAID drive, and please have a driver disc
(and spare) handy for the install and for some recovery operations.
2. Follow the RAID Hack instructions (in Dutch) at:
http://balusc.xs4all.nl/Ned/Twe-WRH.html
3. Find raidhack.w2k.enu.exe on eDonkey or whatever.

Note that 1 puts you at the mercy of a hardware vendor and 2 and 3,
while cheap, are fraught with danger and will likely break your EULA.
That's the non-Free world for ya.

Heh.  Point taken.

But seriously, try the links.  Open-Source gets much of its power from
reuse, which is about using (and improving) what's already written
rather than re-doing something every time it's asked for.  Sites like
linuxdoc.org are more than just great starting points, they're a way to
bring commercial-class (or better) documentation and self-support to
Open-Source software.  And they don't work if YOU don't use them.

Prose is code for people,

Has there been a PLUG AT on Usermode Linux?  I've helped a friend mess
with it but couldn't quite grok it.

Hrm, I wonder how UML works with Linux Checkpointing?
http://www.cluster.kiev.ua/tasks/chpx_eng.html
So you checkpoint a UML session regularly, and if it dies, restart it
from the last checkpoint, possibly on another box.

As I type this, Fedora is downloading, and I'll refer
to these questions as I attempt the installation
again. By the way, the controller is not a Fastrak
(not RAID), even though manufactured by Promise. So I
was on the wrong track (not the fastrack) in
installing the driver for that controller.

The kernel version for RH 9 is 2.4.20-8. I don't know
what Fedora's is, but if the installation proceeds far
enough, I can check it in the /boot directory.

I agree, the rootstrap tool does a good job of building a current debian
system using good old apt, change your sources as needed.  If you have
problems with Woody, try Sarge instead.

I use "screen" to handle the uml start up, this way the boot messages
are available, and it will start on its own without an X-server, or
dedicated console assignment.  This is the script that I use to start
the uml as a service from /etc/init.d/:

#!/bin/bash


screen -S uml -d -m su - derek "cd /home/derek/uml ; linux eth0=tuntap,,,192.168.0.3 umid=uml con=pty con0=fd:0,fd:1"

It would be really cool if it did. I'm not sure it would handle the skas
mode's use of a custom kernel memory map interface very well ....

BTW-Are you using skas? i.e., did you patch your host kernel? Now that
I think about it the classic tt mode (which is all you can get with
stock kernel) did exhibit the behavior you described from time to time.
If memory serves. skas mode is much faster and only uses three processes
total.

For a really simple, low-effort way to achieve this, I would think about
the following:

Allocate 50% of each drive for the usual filesystems, software mirrored.
This protects you from hardware failure but not from accidental deletes,
programs going nuts, filesystem bugs, etc. etc.

For example, on a pair of hypothetical 40GB drives you could have half the
drive used like this:

200MB  /dev/md0 /boot
512MB  /dev/md1 <swap>
8192MB /dev/md2 /
8192MB /dev/md3 /home

The rest of the drives serves as a mirrored local to-disk backup area:

16384MB /dev/md4 /backups

I suggest setting up a script that uses "dump" to back up the mirrored
partitions to the backups area.  A sample script is attached.

The first level 0 dump should be copied to a couple tapes, a stack of
CD-Rs, or a hard drive that is removed from the system.  (Alternatively,
only allocate 25% of your disks, and make the backup area the other 75%,
but that wastes a lot of your online storage on static data.)

The level 0 backup would only be needed if a file that has not changed
since that level 0 backup was created needed to be restored.  I've never
had to do this, since I seem to only damage/delete recently created files.
However, you'll want that level 0 backup somewhere-- just in case.  (I
usually use stacks of CD-Rs for this.)

The attached backup script sample schedule never does a level 0 (full)
backup for this reason.

Easy recovery is the reason I like the dump utility.  Using "restore -i" I
can use the bash-like interface to mark the files I want restored, then
restore them.  (Because RAID provides basic protection, I'm seldom doing a
full restore.)

The "Tower of Hanoi" sequence mentioned in the script makes it a bit
harder to find the files you want restored but saves lots of disk space.
If you want a truly easy recovery, just make every backup a level 1 and
you'll never need to hunt through multiple backups to find the files you
want.

As always, do a test restore to familiarize yourself with the process so
you don't have to learn it under pressure.  Also, periodic test restores
help ensure that the backups are valid and that you've included all the
devices that should be included.

In addition to the fine STFW answer you got, I can refer you to a nice
RTFM as well:

http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-9-Manual/custom-guide/ch-software-raid.html

I've always set up RAID-1 at system install time.  I have not "converted"
an existing system to RAID-1 and suspect that doing so would be tricky.  I
can think of several ways to do it-- and none of them are as easy as a
fresh install.

(How's that for an experienced perspective?  ;-)

Subject: [PLUG] sudoers confusion
Message-ID: <3FC3B590.9060809@pobox.com>

I am setting up a couple of machines with users and permissions, but 
after reading the sudoers man page I am confused about which hosts the 
sudoers file affects.  For example, as far as I understand, sudoers is a 
local file for that machine only, not a system-wide server file that 
provides information for the whole network like named does.  But the man 
page has an example that shows permissions for many machines on a 
network.  How can a sudoers file on one machine control permissions for 
other machines on the network?  Isn't it true that if I try to execute 
some commands on another host, it would be that other host that 
determines my permissions, not the sudoers file on my machine or any 
other host on the network?  I guess my main question is: Does a sudoers 
file only determine permissions for users executing commands on the host 
where the sudoers file exists, or does it only determine permissions for 
users who are logged into the host where the sudoers file is, or can it 
determine permissions for machines that the user is neither logged into 
nor trying to execute commands on?

It can't.  More below...

Yes.

Yes.

Isn't this the same question as before or did I misunderstand you?  Sudo
only controls execution of commands so the login vs. execute distinction
doesn't apply.

> or can it determine permissions for machines that the user is neither
> logged into nor trying to execute commands on?

Only if the sudoers file exists on that system too.

The reason hostnames exist in the sudoers file is so the exact same file
can be copied to many systems.  If the hostname entry in the sudoers file
doesn't match the local host name, that entry is ignored.

For example in this hypothetical sudoers file:

----- /etc/sudoers
bigadmin ALL=(ALL) ALL
midadmin host01,host02=(ALL) ALL
smalladmin host01=(ALL) ALL
-----

This file has been coped to /etc/sudoers on host01, host02, and host03.

On host01, all three users can run any command as any user.  On host02,
only midadmin and bigadmin can run any command.  Smalladmin has no
capabilities at all when running sudo on host02.  On host03, only bigadmin
can run commands via sudo.

The sudo documentation does a poor job of explaining this.

No not a program, the osst driver dumped errors to the console
instead of a log file.  The same thing at least used to 
happen sometimes with floppy drives too.  It would be nice 
if the error logging of various drivers could be linked to 
user defined facilities under menuconfig so that stuff can 
be broken out more without extra processing.  Just
getting driver messages including that error 
recovery is occuring  off the console I'm using 
is what I'm after.  Maybe I can redirect stderr
next time I run taper.  There are lines in osst.c
that say kern_xxx suggesting the logging is supposed
to go to syslog.  Why then does it go to the 
console when a bad sot in a tape is found?  If var 
were not mounted I'd understand, but this isn't the 
case.  If it's the driver writer's fault that's,
very annoying programming style to have a driver
print to stderr.

Nice work Steve.  Thanks.  And thanks for all the suggestions everyone
gave.  I have done MD raid before and may stick with that.  I know
that a TRUE backup is the best but actually don't care that much.  I
will backup the datafiles I want the rest I'll leave to the raid.  I
did a quick calculations of the chance of two harddrives failing in
the same machine and got:

GivenDateTime*HardFailureRate*TimeZone\364.5+WeatherChanges-BuildingFacilities+AmountICare\2(b/c
you always divide by two)*3.141569*C\-392K

Gives that there is about 1 in 2.6B^7 chance. I can live with that.

Okay, I have too much time.  I'll go build that system.  Thanks for
all the help.

I can once Linux is installed. Instead of putting the
root partition so high on the first drive, although I
don't know whether this matters, I installed a second
drive and attempted to install Red Hat 9.0 in the
root. Installation of packages had proceeded for about
40 minutes when the installer said it couldn't install
OPEN OFFICE and this was a fatal error. This ticks me
off, since OO is of course in no way essential to the
operation of Linux.

I may either attempt to install another distribution
or, more likely, a lean, mean initial installation of
Red Hat to see if this is successful. I was almost
done when the installation crashed.

RTFM.  It means the information bind is getting from socceramerica.net
is gimpy.  Considering BIND documentation does explain things like
this, and BIND's tendency to be quite insecure in the wrong hands, I
question whether you should be running your own BIND.

I'm using whatever came with RH 8, which appears to be 1.0. Ouch! What

RTFM. Hmm, I see your teaching ability is something I wonder about.

Yes, I should read the manual. Yes, I should have put a subject on it
- noticed it right after it left the screen.

I really didn't think it was out of the ordinary.  I was focusing on
all possible solution reading what I can and using the vast internet
to expand my knowledge all at the same time.

Thanks to all the rest who answered that.  Was a nice quick way to
eliminate one cause of the problem.

Backups aren't about guarding against double failure-- they're about
guarding against the far-more-probable accidents that RAID can't help with
such as file deletion, file overwrites, program bugs, accidental "mkfs",
etc.

At the barest minimum, you should copy /home onto CD-Rs or to another
system "occassionally".  How much effort would it take to recreate
everything vs. the effort to make a copy once in a while?

If you think you can recreate everything, perhaps just a "find" list of
all your files E-mailed to yourself from time to time would be enough.  At
least this way you'd know what had to be re-created.  ;-)

Well I don't (didn't) have a problem with pdfs at home as OpenOffice.org 
doesn't run in the background and Mozilla is 1.4 BTW or I wouldn't have 
tried the damn upgrade thing.  At work I'm back to 1.4.1 and everything is 
working fine again with OpenOffice.org turned off.  At home it still is.

When I get a breather on this current project I will probably take the
time to fill out a bugzilla report but for now Mozilla is on my
do-not-touch list.

Message-ID: <1069830584.6292.21.camel@sparticus>

Dear Friends,

Starting a business is like having a baby.

My time has been really thin lately as I push to drive sales upward.

Since things are starting to settle down (and our revenue outlook
appears excellent), I thought I'd spend some time to revive MWVLUG's web
site.

The truth is that I had the hard drive that housed MWVLUG blow a gasket,
never to return. Fortunately I keep good backups; I've restored
something like 70 per cent of the archived data. Soon the web site will
have _all_ of the information it used to have.

Beyond the old information, I've posted some new stuff too, such as a
tutorial for building a spam/virus filtering relay server. There's more.

Finally, there's a ton of new stuff you can do on the new site. One of
my favorite features is a fully featured forum area where users can post
questions, give answers, or just blow off steam. An automatic profanity
filter prevents any "slips in grammar."

So let me know what you think, I value you're input!


Very Truly Yours,

I'm trying to use my webserver as a router, as well. I've put a second 
network card in, and verified that both of them work.
However, I can't seem to get iptables to do NAT.  
input/forward/output/prerouting/postrouting in all tables is configured to 
'accept', and the 'nat' table has a rule "-A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j 
MASQUERADE". However, this doesn't seem to actually do any IP masquerading.
Is this obviously incorrect?

You should double check that ip forwarding is enabled.  `cat
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`  If is it disabled, equal to zero (0), then
do a `echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` to enable it.  It is
generally a good idea to throw that line into your firewall script or in
your sysctl.conf set "net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1".

If you already have ip forwarding enabled, then please disreguard this
message.

  I've suspected that Apple users have a cable or two not fully seated.
Actually, his attitude toward this project supports what I always believed
was the Redmond attitude toward "features" in their application software: "I
can do it, therefore I put it in".

  Well, we had the fellow who built a coffee maker into his desktop tower
case so why not a floppy raid to hold the mission-critical database?

I have had hit-or-miss results with the Promise card.  I am using
the ATA-133 card, the ones that Maxtor rebrands and includes with
the big drives.  These cards work on one of my machines, and not
for the other.  I had to modify my grub.conf:

...
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.20-19.9 ro root=/dev/hde1
...

I am on the road, and have poor access to the machines, so if you
are still having problems in another week, contact me and we'll
debug this stuff.

After I spent fifteen minutes googling around for the web address, only
to end up finding it in the Eugene-LUG mailing list (of which I'm not
even subscribed - lol)... I finally found it at www.mwvlug.org ...

*Nice* ...

Plenty of content, a nice clean look, I think.  Only ting I don't see
right off the bat is a link to the mailing list... but that could be me
not having whiped all the sleep from my eyes, so I just don't see it..

Perfect. The birthdays of famous people is quite large. I wish I'd
previewed it before I'd added all of those people into the calendar...

I've also added the lotr calendar. My daughter now wants a palm so she
can see the lotr calendar.

Thanks for the link.

As somebody else pointed out, you need to be sure to make sure ip
forwarding is enabled.  If it is, and that isn't the problem, it's
really a little difficult to just see one line of an iptables rule and
diagnose a problem.  It would be a lot easier to see the whole script
(assuming you're using a script... if not, iptables-save) to see if
there are any big issues with it.

I should add that there is one problem I see often with the software
RAID-1.  Every now and then, for no apparent reason, a single disk
partition will be dropped out of the mirrored pair.  The only indication
is a message in syslog and the /proc/mdstat now shows "[U_]" instead of
the expected "[UU]".  I have a cron script that monitors this, but it can
be quite the annoyance.

I see no I/O errors logged at the time and SMART says all is well on the
drive.  It's also generally just a single partition, not the whole drive,
so I doubt it's a hardware problem.

To get the partition back I just:

raidhotadd /dev/mdX /dev/hdXX

Then wait for the resync to complete.

I'll second this.  I've seen all kinds of strange problems because of HTML
that "looked OK" but was nonetheless malformed.

The W3 validator is so easy to use that there's really no excuse to have
invalid HTML.

Side note:

You might try the mdadm tool. Not only can it replace all the raidtools,
it can also run as a daemon and send state changes to you via email. See
Debian or go to http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/

Using the same sudoers file for every host on a network seems like a bad 
approach to me.  It's just like the DNS problem.  DNS servers exist 
because static hosts files are not adequate to answer queries for a 
whole network because they become outdated over time.  But sudoers is 
not a server, it is just a static local file, so it doesn't really 
provide information for the entire network, only for individual hosts. 
 So if sudoers permissions change, then the sys admin would have no 
choice but to copy the global sudoers file to every host on the network 
again.  This just puts a bunch on information on each host, most of 
which has nothing to do with those hosts.  I can't see any benefit to 
that.  Does anyone know of a reason why I might not want to create a 
unique suoders file for every host on my network and maintain them 
separately?

It is geared towards Apple users primarily. The way it works in iCal is 
that each of these things are subscriptions. You can un-check the ones 
that you don't want to view and unsubscribing is a matter of just 
hitting the delete key.  On other calendars, it doesn't work as 
elegantly, but at least they do work.

For anyone that is considering a new laptop, I would highly recommend 
both the iBooks and PowerBooks. Since X11 is included as well as fink, 
I have access to over 3000 unix apps and pretty much use my iBook 
exclusively. Panther is a very nice OS and has a ton of things that 
make me more productive. I would be happy to go more into those with 
anyone that is interested. Apple desktops are nice as well but they are 
considerably more and I like the mobility. the 12" iBooks with a g4 and 
combo drive ( cd-r/dvd drive) starts at just $1099 which is rather 
reasonable for a laptop.

  Well, ... federal law makes them illegal. There's a faxspam Web site from
which I got some useful information; I was on the mail list a few days, too.
However, the major fax spam houses hide their originating phone numbers and
it takes more time than I have to track them down.

  What I'll be starting this coming weekend is getting addresses for the
companies that are advertised and go after them. Since they contracted with
the fax spammers I'm holding them responsible under the federal law. In
Oregon you can file in small claims court, too.

Ask them in writing to stop.  If they FAX you again, sue 'em in Small

I have installed hylafax a couple of times. It is very flexible and
configurable. I currently have one install printing directly to a
printer and emailing PDFs to a mailbox for backup, reprints, etc.

The hylafax-user list is helpful, once you've exhausted the docs.

I've worked on a system that uses hylafax and stores the pdf files I 
create in a PostgreSQL database.

Works great and is fairly easy to manage your faxes through.

  Groan! Lookie here:
   <http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/ptech/11/26/master.term.reut/index.html>

  What the LA County PC police seem to not understand is that hard drives,
cdrom drives and others are not offended by being labled "master" and
"slave". As a matter of fact, some like not having the responsibility of
being first.

  Well, as Mark Twain once remarked, "If the country was tilted to the left,
all the loose pieces would slide down to California". To which I add,
"California: Granola Country. The land of nuts and flakes."

  Happy Thanksgiving to you, too.

Well, it doesn't matter, of course, whether the participants like it or
not.  It isn't about whether the drives are offended.  It's about people
being uncomfortable with some words.  (I have a friend who is perfectly
comfortable with the label "pervert" for her lifestyle.  It's apparently
used frequently in her particular community.  That doesn't mean it's an
appropriate word to use in every context to describe her.  And it still
makes other people uncomfortable that aren't being labelled.)

Yeah, it's a great display of ignorance to be offended with the words in
this case... a bit like King James changing the word "slave" to "servant"
in most of his rendition of the Holy Bible.  It's an attempt to appease
those with limited understanding of the situation.

But to quote the actual article:

<quote src="above url">
"I do understand that this term has been an industry standard for years
and years and this is nothing more than a plea to vendors to see what they
can do," he said. "It appears that some folks have taken this a little too
literally."

Sandoval said that he had already rejected a suggestion that the county
stop buying all equipment carrying the "master" and "slave" labels and had
no intention of enforcing a ban on such terms with suppliers.
</quote>

So that pretty much sums up the position without taking some knee-jerk,
hateful stance.  They had complaints and forwarded them.

Now, the truly crazy bit is here:
<quote src="same url above">
In June, the Los Angeles city council unanimously passed a law requiring
that any companies doing business with the city disclose profits they may
have made from slavery in the 19th Century. In 2000, the council supported
federal legislation seeking reparations for descendants of slaves.
</quote>

How on EARTH can they possibly estimate the profits reaped from slavery in
the 19th century?

The effects of 19th (and 18th and 17th etc.... hell, 20th and 21st)
century slavery are so broad and deep, I don't think there's a single
company around (whether they existed back then or not) that hasn't
profitted from slavery.

It's kooky to even ask anyone to disclose that kind of information.

Slavery was just early corporate welfare.

I can find no solid evidence that Mark Twain ever said this either at
http://www.twainquotes.com/ or the net in general. But, the version
I rather like is "The loose nuts all roll to the edge of the country."

Phew, if you talked to the midwesterners I talk to every day, you might
have a different opinion.

Granted, there is a preselection going on that predisposes these people to
being idiots and assholes.

  Perhaps it was Will Rogers. And, when the loose nuts roll to the edge,
they fall off onto California.

Rob,

  When the avian carrier fails to deliver the packets, they can be broiled
and served for dinner. I suspect that floppy disks would be much less

In many environments there are several boxes that the same group of users
use for, say, development lifesyscle. You might have a dev, test, and
production box, all with the same sudoers file. If you version your sudoers
file, which is a good idea, you would benefit from having it all in one file
because you would have one place to look for things and one place to make
changes. You could keep your severs in sync with this file by implementing
an automated deployment process. If you use CVS, perhaps you would use the
loginfo file in CVSROOT to kick off the automated deployment process each
time the sudoers file is updated.

But if they fail to deliver packets, then they are lost. If you have them to
boil, then the packets must have arrived, unless there is an error in the
transport layer where the packets have fallen off of the bird. But if your
engineers are diligent and use enough duct tape for the given conditions,
this should not be an issue.

Solved.
I should've given you iptables-save, yeah. As it turns out, that config was 
ok (and forwarding was enabled).
Although I did a number of fixes, the one that finally solved it was 
misconfiguration of the dhcp server: It didn't specify a router to clients.

IMO, fwbuilder is the right tool for this.  4 interfaces is alot and no 
matter how good a iptables wiz you are,  it's much too easy to fat finger 
a config file.  And with fwbuilder you can comment the config file, xml 
based, to aid in the future audit of your firewall rule set.


www.fwbuilder.org.  Requires X and some specific libraries, but a very
nice product and the author is responsive to all queries via the
mail-list.  I run fwbuilder from central host and scp the resulting
scripts to the firewalls that I manage.

And I've managed up to 7 interfaces on a firewall with fwbuilder.

Damn!  Apparently I really, really overestimated the average
intelligence of Californians.  I had thought it was around 12, but
this makes me think more like 2.

Can we just give California back to Mexico, make California a
live-fire combat training zone, or otherwise do something destructive
with it before nobody can escape the dangerously high levels of stupid
it emits?

Get a roll of black construction paper, tape it in a loop in your fax
machine and hit send before you go to sleep. Or fax several hundred
pure black pages from your computer.
Now, although pure black is nice, you can be creative.

Several hundred pages of

====FAX=DIAGNOSTICS====
I/O Error 13.2453.2
Unplug and call for service.

work very well, as do informative pages about federal junk fax law and
the more immature stuff - schoolgirls on copiers and the such.

After making them spend $40+ for toner and a box of paper, generally
they leave you alone. I think there is a blacklist that a lot of the
fax spammers use, and doing something like this gets you on there ;)

Is something like that any more legal than sending the spam faxes in the
first place?

For some reason I could not install Red Hat 8 or 9
after installing the Ultra100 TX2 drive controller.
Either the install progrma isn't that good, or the
disks I made were defective, although they tested good
on the media check. I just installed ASPLinux because
the CD's were handy, and it appears to be fully
functional.

I will be glad to share my experience with you, or
anyone else, if there are still issues. There are
probably millions of DMA-66 computers still in service
that are worth this inexpensive upgrade, so the issue
deserves attention. In short, it's worth the trouble
to do it, but expect some.

Will Rogers had a large home in the LA area; it's now a California state 
park.  As I remember, it's off of Sunset boulevard, a west of UCLA and 
the San Diego freeway (i405).

Subject: [PLUG] Kernel headers
Message-ID: <20031127150450.GC9192@brian.brianandkellyderr.com>

I recently deleted the kernel-headers-2.4.19 package on my slackware
box.  I figured I didn't need it since I am running 2.4.22.  However, it
seems that it complete wiped out /usr/include/linux.  I'm wondering,
since I'm using a custom kernel if it is my responsibility to copy
/usr/include/linux/include/ to /usr/include/linux/ ?  If not then how am
I supposed to have the kernel headers in place for compiling
applications that need the headers?

Thanks!

I believe that you want to re-install the original kernel-headers.  Think it 
has more to do with what glibc? was compiled against.  The advice has been 
not to use your custom includes, but I'm not sure of the exact reason.

Reinstall the kernel-headers package...

You're supposed to have /usr/include/linux match up with what glibc, et
al, was compiled against, not what the kernel-flavor-of-the-day happens
to be.  :-)

I had this problem once earlier just after installing
Linux, but I don't remember how I solved it.It starts
a bunch of things.

Starting xinetd                   OK
Starting sendmail

Starting console mouse services   OK 

When reaching sendmail, it hangs for a long
time--probably two or three minutes. I do not use
sendmail, so presumably either removing it or not
attempting to start it is the answer. Could anyone
give me advice?

My guess, with problems like hanging services, is DNS isn't set up
properly... your machine may not have a resolvable hostname or something
similar.

If you don't use sendmail, why is it starting up when you boot your
box?  :-)

I would suggest stopping sendmail from loading itself when you boot up -
the hows of that are dependent upon the linux distribution you're
running.  If it's Gentoo, "rc-update del sendmail default" should do the
trick.  If it's Slackware "chmod -x /etc/rc.d/rc.sendmail" should do the
trick.  If it's something else... have fun.  :-)

Happy Thanksgiving

RedHat for one has always started sendmail.
# service sendmail stop
# chkconfig --level 2345 sendmail off

  ... and if it's Red Hat, 'man chkconfig' shows you how to either delete
sendmail from the startup scripts or turn it off for specific (or all) run
levels.

It's never appropriate to label a woman as a sex idol.  If a woman
accepts being called a pervert, it suggests she has much deeper
problems.  She should demand better treatment than she is getting from
you Mr. Brelin.  If you harm her: I hope you are found out, bound, and
thrown in jail.  Not only is an attack on women offensive to women, it's
an affront to men also.

I leave for a while till Thanksigiving of all days Mr. Brelin only to
find you're attacking the dignity of women on a tech list of all places
where you think you'll get away with it.

Additionally to turning off sendmail you may also want to fix your DNS
problem, as to deal with the cause and not only with the symptom of your
little patient.

Right.  Forgot that.  Usually giving the machine a proper name is all that's 
required.  Something like this in /etc/hosts
	127.0.0.1	rufus.localdomain	localhost	rufus

Message-ID: <1069970407.27751.78.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I'm using spamassassin, but I put suspected spam 
in a folder because there can be false positives.  
Thing is, if there are definite spam indicators, 
can't spamassassin send those messages with a 
different header than it does possible spam?  
I'm thinking of fake outlook, address forged, 
and improper html in message.  The only thing 
I would add to having those messages trashed 
is storing any real address they came from to 
deny any inbound connection in the future.  I 
can look at this list for any address that 
shouldn't be blocked later and use the phone
in most cases if it's someone I need to be 
IM'ed by.

How do I stop any malformed messages or definite 
spam from originating at my server and going out?
Another check that should be done is every 
outgoing message should be checked for sensitive
system passwords, etc.

It's ridiculous to look at all suspected spam 
in evolution because a lot of it is just plain 
obvious.  Can I pass my mail to something before
evolution gets it after spamassassin does?  It
would be nice to run it through a filter 
that catches the spam score being at fifteen, 
etc. I want to keep definite spam out of the 
spam folder in evolution because it does take
time to manually inspect stuff.

Can mimedefang be used with Postfix?  

How can Postfix be set up to do graylisting?

A trick I'm considering is a dual MTA mail
system.  The first MTA that gets email is
a special type.  This MTA only forwards
a special message with the header of a message
it wants to forward inside and a reply to 
address that will essentially subscribe the 
recipient to that message if they want it.  
For mailing lists, this might be a pain,
though exceptions for those can always be 
looked into.  Considering some messages are 
nondescript traps that flash you when you 
investigate, requiring that the intent be 
in the subject and header is probably 
reasonable.

Does anyone know how to mine the real addresses
IM's are coming from and build a database of
all addresses with user associations that my
email server deals with?  Having the information
can help with whitelisting and blacklisting 
efforts.

I put everything over score 8 into a folder that I never look at.
Between 5 and 8 goes into a folder that I do look at once a week. Not
too much in there and almost never a false positive. 

That way you don't have to go through the mass amount of all spam mails.

I do something similar to this, but I also keep my current highest rated
spam, just as a kind of amusement.

The current winner is 63.8, by the way... with stock Debian values.

Michael,

You're crazy.  I would like to be more subtle and helpful, but I don't
think you're getting the hints and suggestions of others.  I think you
need to get some help.  You're paranoid and delusional.

I didn't label anyone as a sex idol and I didn't write anything about
whether or not this girl that accepts the "pervert" label has other
problems or not (only that she self-applies the label and isn't offended).
If anything, my point was that it's OK to be offended by the term and do
what you can to limit its usage even though the person using it isn't
offended by it.

As for hurting her, I barely know her anymore and I don't think I ever
touched her any more than a couple of hugs when we were better acquainted.
The idea that I might hurt her came from your demented, sociopathic mind.
This paranoia and hate is further exhibited in your revenge fantasies. I
really hope you find the strength to get help.

If you're coming into the city, I'd be happy to sit down with you in
person and talk it out.  Let me know.

Look again.  The attack was all in your mind.

Nice of you to pass that on and tar someone's reputation when they're
down.  Throw her name in while your at it.  Just because she calls
herself a pervert, which she probably didn't, doesn't mean you agree
with her on it.  She is a person of value no matter what she says.
She has a right to demand proper respect.  She deserves respect 
even if she doesn't demand it which you have ignored by your
statements on this list Mr. Brelin.  Oh wait, your trying to
convince the world of your own view aren't you Mr. Brelin?
A world where there is no free will and human life has no
value.

If she left you good for her.  Very sensible move.

If Californian's want to make tech terms less offensive, even if 
their approach is silly, why stop them?  Master and slave aren't 
the most sensible labels for drives connected to an ATA/ATAPI 
controller though I do think it's ridiculous to go on a tangent
against corporations over it.  Clearly, some people don't need 
much of an excuse.

Ok, that being said I have upgraded glibc several times since I had
kernel 2.4.19 or whatever it was.  Should I install the latest
kernel-headers package then?  I'm banking on yes so I'll do that before
I get a reply.  Guess I'm just answering my own question out loud.  :-)

If I am wrong please let me know before too long, in case I mess

What is even remotely "tarring" about that statement?

She probably DIDN'T?  Michael, you're nuts.

My WHOLE POINT was that I don't like that usage of the term.

Huh?!?  How did I fail to respect her?

I have no idea where you got this.  I value all life.

Are you reading what I write or are you just making things up?  We were
acquaintances... I visited her AND HER HUSBAND at her home a few times.
We had many mutual friends.

I hate to ask this, but I must:  What kind of Christian supposes the worst
possible interpretation of every scenario and assumes everyone is lying
all the time?

Do you not have the love, forgiveness, and patience in you to listen,
understand, and respect other people, giving them the benefit of doubt?
Or are you so utterly convinced that the world is full of what you call
sin that there is no room for doubt?

That level of certainty is often a sign of illness.

I really don't think you have a view of objective reality.  I'd be happy
to sit down and talk with you about this and see if there's anything we
can do to help us find a frame of reference for communication.

Who went on a tangent against corporations?  I didn't see that subject
even approached.

I think you're now cutting your own reality from whole cloth, unless I
missed a post.

Yes, you are.  Seems like you're doing the right thing.  Keep glibc and
kernel headers at the appropriate level.

Does your package management system tell you which kernel-headers package
goes with your glibc package?

If you can verify they go together, you're not doing the wrong thing.

Telling the world a woman called herself a pervert,
what were you thinking?  If you'll stop your forgiven.
I can't forgive someone who will just do things like
this again and again endlessly.
  
I've witnessed a very good woman despair in 
my very own arms.  I don't tolerate any form 
of degradation towards women. I hope I can do 
some good by this.  The society is sick though, 
sick to the core.  I've been one on one with 
more than one person afflicted with this 
sickness at PSU where noone seemed to be around 
to protect them or me from it.  

There are things that need to be flushed out of 
PSU.  It has grown quickly with very poor 
leadership.  The result is poor safety and an 
unnecessarily high tension level for faculty
and students.
  
A Junior should be able to get into University 
Studies classes.  The UNST courses themselves 
are riddled with controversy.  Part of the 
problem is PSU's computer systems, earning 
a CS degree from an institution that won't 
keep the computers straight is frightening.  

I tried to take Middle Eastern Studies for 
broadening only to find: it was funded by the 
Turkish government, it made the paper for 
controversial activity, and Professor Bascji 
wouldn't moderate adequately.  My parents 
were dead set against me taking it so I really 
had a rough time when I got out because they
lost their money.  They were already worried 
about me.

Reportedly, noone got financial aid this term.

I deserve an apology for the Bush bashing and 
the threats my last instructor there put me 
through.  I probably won't even be offered a 
second chance without presenting a formal 
application for reinstatement.  I'm not 
interested in going through that.  I reported
or tried to report the speech teacher, but I 
was dismissed without any letter or any effort 
on the part of the University to find out what 
was going on.  Does anyone there care?  I'm
facing 24 without a 4 year degree and a memory 
of not being treated like an adult at PSU.  I 
got old at PSU.  I was there from 2001 up to 
fall of last year.  I am an adult even if I'm
not accomplished enough for it.

As far a the accusation I'm judgemental, you 
don't tell me it's ok for a woman to call herself 
a pervert.  The latter is not open to debate.
Being alone for the foreseeable future without
making any free choice to remain single is bad
enough, listening to a thread on a tech list
degrade into a woman called herself a pervert
and that's ok is more than I can bear without
protesting very fiercely.

Maybe being PC is driving towards a real need
that has been ignored for too long.

Go there yourself Carla!  What is the matter with you?  I tried
to counter Jeme's inappropriate posts.  All you can do is 
call me a lunatic?!?!?  This is what I hate about plug
list.  These off topic posts are sickening where the attacks
that happen are worse than posts themselves.  You
should consider being decent.  Do you think women should
be treated like sex objects perhaps even getting abused
till they die?  Or, do you agree with me that Jeme was 
out of line even telling us that a woman called herself 
a pervert because that is degrading and annoying to those
of us trying to use plug-list for what it's supposed to
be for?

If you only care about having it off in your current runlevel, that works. 
If you want to make sure it never rears its ugly daemon head, use the 
incantation I posted previously.

I installed and setup apt-get in a fedora core 1 install I've been

fine and apt-get upgrade which went fine until the end:

Good question.  Couldn't sleep without knowing more...  Check this page from 
Linux From Scratch, to quote

http://www.faqs.org/docs/linux_scratch/chapter06/kernel.html

------------------
6.11.3. Why we copy the kernel headers and don't symlink them

In the past it was common practice to symlink the /usr/include/{linux,asm} 
directories to /usr/src/linux/include/{linux,asm}. This was a bad practice, 
as the following extract from a post by Linus Torvalds to the Linux Kernel 
Mailing List points out:

I would suggest that people who compile new kernels should:

  - not have a single symbolic link in sight (except the one that the
    kernel build itself sets up, namely the "linux/include/asm" symlink
    that is only used for the internal kernel compile itself)

And yes, this is what I do. My /usr/src/linux still has the old 2.2.13
header files, even though I haven't run a 2.2.13 kernel in a _loong_
time. But those headers were what glibc was compiled against, so those
headers are what matches the library object files.

And this is actually what has been the suggested environment for at
least the last five years. I don't know why the symlink business keeps
on living on, like a bad zombie. Pretty much every distribution still
has that broken symlink, and people still remember that the linux
sources should go into "/usr/src/linux" even though that hasn't been
true in a _loong_ time.

------------------


So, presumably when a distro releases an updated glibc package they may 
(should?) still compile it against the initial kernel release that they 
provided.

IOW, if FishHeadLinux 8.0 comes with kernel 2.4.20-1, then no matter how 
many times they issue a new glibc package, it will always be compiled 
against 2.4.20-1.  Even if they release kernel-2.4.20-23.

Then FishHeadLinux 9.0 comes out with a new kernel and new glibc compiled 
against that.

Looks like you are using apt packages that have not been updated
to include the fedora keys. GPG#4f2a6fd2 is the Fedora key:
http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?search=0x4f2a6fd2&op=index


This should fix it for you:

  rpm --import /usr/share/rhn/RPM-GPG-KEY*

This is the best solution. Most repositories have their keys available,
here are some more:
rpm --import http://www.fedora.us/FEDORA-GPG-KEY
rpm --import http://rpm.livna.org/RPM-LIVNA-GPG-KEY
rpm --import http://freshrpms.net/packages/RPM-GPG-KEY.txt
rpm --import http://dag.wieers.com/packages/RPM-GPG-KEY.dag.txt
rpm --import http://atrpms.physik.fu-berlin.de/RPM-GPG-KEY.atrpms

However. every now and then you run into a package which does not have the
right key, in which case you can disable key checking in apt.conf

Subject: [PLUG] The list needs moderation...
Message-ID: <1070008591.29197.79.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

It has come to my attention that this list is highly 
abused.  Certain people including Jeme and even Carla 
and another guy have a tendency to flame.  There may 
be others as well who do this.  It's at a minimum 
impolite at worst being very distracting and even 
spiteful at times.  I don't know where some people 
are coming from, but since when do you take a non
professional attitude to a list that's supposed to 
be about legitimate Linux tech questions as opposed 
to Jeme's morality or Carla's lack of tact?  Is it 
unreasonable to ask people to censor their own 
language and above all avoid addressing anyone on 
here with an attitude of your nuts or your delusional?

More than this is needed, if anyone goes out of line 
with offensive non Linux tech questions it either 
needs to be regulated by the list administrator or 
the people who are deciding to flame themselves.  
People aren't regulating themselves, even going on 
plug-talk thinking I might calm some of this down I 
found I was totally naive to even try.

Would it be that hard to block a person for a short
period or make a subscription switch to plug-talk?
I hope a free for all where people can come 
with an attitude of show no respect for anyone else 
defending themselves when someone complains, instead 
of trying to be accomodating, isn't the permanent 
norm.  A bayesian filter on this mailing list, applied
to all subscribers equally, should be able to put a 
stop to this.  This censorship in the long run, if 
done non preferentially with proper foresight, has 
the potential to increase the list's value.

I am discouraged that Jeme chose such an off
topic post again that is so highly controversial  
It lowers the discussion even if Jeme gets the 
benefit of the doubt that he's simply stubborn 
about using language that's abusive because 
he's "special."

Not to single out Jeme, the same should apply 
to anyone who wants to do this.  It's a shame 
if the community doesn't have the will to 
address abuse as a whole instead of addressing
it on an individual basis.  Unfortunately,
I am having a hard time with all the you're
a nut cracks including Carla's your a lunatic
post which totally surprised me.  This should
be my community and I should find a way to
make being on at least this list work, but
I'm just barely in the mood to do that
because of the abuse.

Sometimes I wonder if there are many out there 
getting my posts where I only notice three to 
ten posters to my threads on this list that is 
supposed to have close to 150+ people on it.
If the linux community fragments, one thing 
frankly all of us should recognize as a 
possibility, where will Linux and other 
OSS be?  Unity is important for Linux and 
OSS.  That which divides threatens the 
talent pool.
  
Linux communities must find the will to put 
aside individual political beefs, religious 
beefs, anything else that's a beef, and 
other prejudices to be most affective.  

The one up man ship when something goes 
where it should doesn't help with tech
problems though it's awfully hard for 
people to stop without a moderator.
This is why a good samaritan is sometimes 
the person who breaks up a fight :-)

I hope this is a challenge to those who
read it.  It shouldn't be the fuse for
another flame thread.  If it is, 
good bye Ed, Kyle, Mike, and everyone
else who has helped me at one time or
another.

Robby,

Is that a home grown system or one that is available GPL?

Michael, let's not call the police where there has been no a real crime.
Not to mention it would be a time sucker for the one who has to play the
moderator.

If you are offended by the attacks, you can easily turn them off
yourself: stick to Linux in your postings (and they will not flame any
more) and filter out the ones you don't like. There are plenty others.

Moderation begins at home.  Create a kill file and discard email
from Jeme, Carla and whoever else is offending you.  Then review each
post before you send it and ensure that it sticks to topics appropriate
for the list.

I'm having difficulties w/ a modem connection thru pppd on Mandrake 9.1. I seem to be dialing out fine, but it immediately terminates the connection, usually w/ pppd error # 10 - unable to determine client IP address. Numeruos attemts w/ both pppd & linuxconf haven't seemed to make it. Any ideas on how the client identifies its IP? I've been accepting default values through the process so far.

Hiding under a Rock when this is a community problem is not the
answer.  I haven't started anything that's off topic myself on
plug directly.  I'm not the problem here, or is this is a list
for people who don't believe in dealing with problems as a 
larger community?

And maybe telling someone to shut up is rude.  Try using more than a
sound byte once in a while if you're going to lodge a complaint against
someone, it's bad enough up to half a conversation is going to likely
be lost because individual people are making the mistake of trying to
moderate themselves instead of calling for moderation at a much higher
level.  Bayesian filtering could be done at the top where false
positives could be avoided by having messages and their posters
redirected to plug-talk when what is posted is suspected of being
off topic.  I don't buy it than any community can't come up with
standards for posts, for one thing it goes to the very issue of
being received that the decision has been made to forego a proper
community standard.

A large problem with moderation is agreeing on what needs to be blocked.
If you:
	a) block email from posters that, in your view, persistently 
	abuse this forum
	b) ensure that your posts don't abuse the forum

You'll find the list a much more pleasant place to participate.  Because
you will have screened out off topic posts.  

This is not hiding under a rock.  This is taking direct and concrete 
action to fulfill your desire to have this list conform to your desires.

I would disagree that you are not part of the problem.  Your seeming 
inability to read text without injecting non-existent meaning and 
disposition to enter long, wandering messages does go off topic.

The only thing the visudo documentation says about saving changes is

parameter for saving the changes.  And if you just quit out of visudo 
after editing the file, it doesn't save the changes either.  What's the 
big secret?  How do you save your changes using visudo?

Hostile sound byte offering no path to compromise or truce.
This is not a community approach, it's not even a fair one.

It wouldn't cost too much too have the list moderated from 
the top if the community really came together to support 
and guide this.  With moderation at the top, someone who 
gets upset one day is more likely to post successfully 
later if a moderator intervenes to spare others.  That 
way, there is the maximum discourse between the maximum 
number of people.  It also wins from the standpoint of 
watchfullness.  Where is the interest in having spam 
dealt with where it starts?  People kill filing the 
posts they don't like based on who posts run the 
risk of missing parts of threads.  It also discourages 
listening to people who ask questions over those who 
answer them, a long term growth barrier.  If the long 
spam threads have proven anything, it's that individual 
filtering doesn't address the problems on this list
adequately.  Filtering needs to be wisely and fairly 
applied to the list itself at the top, not at the 
level of users mailboxes.  This is not operating as a
community if people are at each others throats.

Phew.  I'm just going to suggest that Michael Rasmussen's ideas be

Subject: [PLUG] dvd playback sync
Message-ID: <1070087214.5417.61.camel@localhost>

Hi,

I've had a lot of trouble with playing dvds. The video and sound seem to
get out of sync fairly quickly (10-15 minutes into it) and deteriorate
over the course of watching. I've tried a whole bunch of things, and
it's gotten somewhat better, but still problematic.

Here's the system:

amd athlon t-bird 1100 mhz 
512 MB PC133 DIMM
Matrox G200 8MB AGP video
onboard AC97 sound
NEC DVD Drive, unknown speed

I had an older ATI video card in there for a while, and the upgrade to
the matrox g200 was very helpful. I also started using the 2.6.0-testX
series of kernels, and that helped a lot too, especially with ALSA.

I could upgrade the video card again, try to find a g400, but I'm kinda
skeptical that's the issue. I checked with hdparm and found that the dvd
drive was responding at 2 MB/s. Turning on dma and 32-bit io (-c1, -d1)
brought that up to 2.85 MB/s, but I can't help but think that this may
be one of the problems. Anyone know anything about getting a dvd drive
to go faster? (or do I just need a newer dvd drive?) The actual bus is
ATA/133/100/66/33 and I've gotten up to 22 MB/s off an IDE hard drive,
and there's nothing else on this channel, so it's not the bus.

Also, is that speed the bottleneck? I've been told that PC133 memory is
just too slow for that kind of playback, but I'm skeptical of that. I
was told the sound driver was the problem, but with the 2.6 kernels
comes ALSA, so that shouldn't be too much of a problem anymore.

Thoughts?

Jeff

What software are you using?  What were the compilation options?

Playing DVDs isn't just a hardware thing.

"WHO" do you suggest lead this effort? Plug is a free form group, has
been as long as I have been a member. I've been a member for almost 5
years. 

What is considered off-topic is a moving target, and changes daily. An
example of this is the spam discussion. Some felt that the whole thing
was off topic, others felt it should get it's own sub-list, and others
felt it should just go on as it is. 

My point is that plug is not an organization like you expect it to be.
This community is just a bunch of people that believe they can help
one-another. In some cases, these like minded people have vastly
different views on how certain things should be done. e.g. Vi vs Emacs.

If one person is moderating the list, we'll end up with someone
moderated that others disagree with. If it's a commitee, we'll end up
with the same thing, plus the commitee probably fighting amongst itself.

All of this leads to the conclusion that leaving what comes into your
email box up to you is the best way to handle it.

Consequently, we end up with suggestions such as you have already
received to write your own inbox rules to send messages from people who
offend you to whatever bit bucket you wish.

In other words, take care of your own problem, because others on this
list feel it would be harmed by moderation.

Another point made by others is YOU need to show a little self
restraint. Posting a reply to an off-topic thread is every bit as bad as
the original post. You are simply perpetuating something that you are
now claiming needs to be resolved.

Well, you already did most all of the things I would have suggested
here... switch to alsa being the first one... getting a preemptable
kernel being number two.

Next up - what are you utilizing to play your DVDs in the software
realm?  MPlayer?  If you aren't using mplayer, start now.  :-)

If you are using MPlayer, make sure you're using 1.0pre2 or CVS.

You know about using +/- to change the audio as you're watching a video,
right?

I found I had problems with OSS emulated DVD playing software getting
out of sync when watching a DVD after twenty minutes or so... I found
recompiling the software (ogle and xine at the time) with Alsa support
solved that problem.

Have fun.

You know... we need another usenet rule, like Godwin's Law, to match up

Yeah, I want to second this.  I may agree with many of the rantings
here, but don't think we need 'em.  I found I was *far* more likely to
stay on topic and I think I now offend people far less often by simply
killfiling Jeme at the SMTP level.  If you're running Postfix and wish
to do the same, check the archives for how I did it.  Otherwise, send me

Yeah, I'm using MPlayer 1.0pre2, and while I know about +/-, I don't
find it works. I go the wrong way the first time, and then a few
keystrokes later I'm completely lost as to where to go next.

I'm using a basic compile/install of MPlayer, and I don't know if it's
using OSS emulation or not, nor do I know how to find out. I'm also
using xv, not mga/xmga, because the mga_vid driver won't compile under
2.6.

Have you tried using the sdl video output plug-in?

And which audio output plug-in are you using?

Which are compiled/available?  I don't think there's any such thing as a
"basic" compile of mplayer.  There are LOTS of configure options.

What's the output of `mplayer -vo help` and `mplayer -ao help`?

Which css library is it compiled against?

100% of the respondents so far have offered zero olive branches, 
zero calls for compromise, and there has been zero change in
derogatory attitudes towards me.  Sad, what community built on
attracting anyone cares so little about what has become a
concerted effort to drive me off?  Killing off the mavericks 
is not wise.  Mike Szulik is being proven right, ordinary 
people in mass will not get on lists like this for help.

Noone has criticized me in a helpful manner.  I've gotten hate
mail though.  So much for being open minded, patient, courteous,
...  I am grateful for the help I have gotten though even if it
did mean being treated like an idiot.

It says instead of coming together as a community and having the
opportunity to work things out so that the largest number of people
can work together affectively, excuses that that only leads to 
fighting will reign instead.  Instead of kill filing it would be
refreshing to hear someone else for once argue for a more diplomatic
approach.  If there is no will to build community, why is this
called the Portland Linux/Unix group anyways?  I simply don't buy
it that a committee would only fight.  I also don't buy the idea
that it's impossible to have a vote through this list in order to
set reasonable moderator standards.  As far as discrimination,
discrimination along with plain old anger right now is rampant.  
This is one of the reasons why so many people defend themselves.  
To a large extent, this is feeding into off topic threads.  
Because people are told to moderate themselves, it makes sense 
to debate whether or not moderation should happen to the list 
itself.

Kill filing does not offer any way to make amends nor any way
to say, "hey any out there listening to Jeme, I don't agree 
with his off topic post showing up on here."  Do I want to be
associated with this list?  Not if Jeme's message and other
messages I don't agree with fill it up with no one moderating
for those who are vulnerable.  It's a warped view of the world
that's being created which itself arguably gives the list a 
bad reputation.  How does much of what gets on here fits in 
with helping people use Linux?  I don't agree with this ultra 
liberal view that a community should not take responsibility 
to keep a discussion list it hosts within it's mission 
statement.  Especially considering the nature of much of the 
off topic stuff that is hitting plug now,the last point takes
on a real urgency.  Libraries have standards of conduct for
patrons, is this such an alien concept?

Subject: [PLUG] sudoers still not working
Message-ID: <3FC8BB45.7040304@pobox.com>

I have the following extremely simple sudoers file (comments removed):

root        ALL = (ALL) ALL
admin    ALL = (ALL) ALL

admin is a login with its own private group.  I get no grammar errors 
after running visudo using the -s parameter.  But when I login as admin 
and try to run groupadd, I get "command not found".  I can login as root 
and run groupadd just fine.  I tried rebooting the system, but that 
didn't work either.  Has anyone worked with sudoers enough to know what 
else I have to do to give a user full access to the system?  Shouldn't 
this just be a 2-minute, one-liner change to a text file?

Eventually, I was hoping to get sudoers working well enough to figure 
out how to give the mysterious nfsnobody user full access to my exported 
directory.  Depending on which user creates files and directories in my 
exported nfs directory, users sometimes can not see directories or files 
because they are owned by a different user.  I thought sudoers would be 
the place to allow all nfs users to see and execute everything in that 
directory.

groupadd probably isn't in your normal user path.

Try something like:

sudo /usr/sbin/groupadd

If you don't know where it is, do a find / -name groupadd 2>/dev/null

If that works, you can do a

PATH=$PATH:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/sbin:[ . . . ]

Ok - try this line to play the DVD:

mplayer -ao alsa9 -vo xv dvd://1

...and see if that still has the sound problems.  I think mplayer
defaults to -ao oss, since that works both for folks using alsa, and for
those using OSS.

Should that fail... what sound card did you say you were using, again?

PLUG is a loose-nit group that has a wide degree of variance in
experience, opinions, and expectations. The only way we are all
going to get along is to accept these differences. We've managed
to get along with each other, more or less, for the last 10 years.


Moderating the list so that it aligns with a particular set of
members' views, morals, political leanings, emacs vs vi, etc, is
a bad deal. 

I disagree with a number of the people who post on PLUG. But
that is part of what keeps PLUG interesting to me. If everyone
here was exactly like me, I would quickly get bored and leave.


The alternative is that we self moderate. Occasionally someone
will step out of line, that is the price we pay to keep this
an open forum. Freedom always comes at a price.

If PLUG is too free-wheeling, or you can't tolerate the opinions
of some of the posters, there is always the freedom to vote
with your feet. There are a million other Linux/open source/free
software forums.

Is Linus telling us we shouldn't use /usr/src/linux to keep our kernel
sources?

So, in other words I need to find out what kernel version the current
glibc package was built against.  Hrmm, interesting...

No, just that: a) if your distribution used a symlink (bad idea) from
/usr/include/linux to the kernel headers, it will require your source to
be in some canonical location. Which was historically /usr/src/linux.
Anymore, it shouldn't matter what directory you put it in. Feel free to
untar linux-2.4.23.tar.bz2 into /usr/local/src/clowns-need-food-1.0 if
you want.

Yup. Some distributions put the kernel headers for /usr/include/linux
into the glibc package. Some put a dependency from the glibc package to
a kernel-headers package (Debian just switched from the former to this).
Some leave you to your own devices, I suppose (bad distro, no cookie for
you).

You need to edit the $PATH variable of your "admin" account to contain
the /sbin and /usr/sbin directories.

'tis your path.

Here's what a friend did.  His PATH has /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin,
so he put a script called 'sudo' in /usr/local/bin, and left the real
'sudo' in /usr/bin.

#!/bin/bash
PATH=$PATH:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/sbin /usr/bin/sudo $@

HTH....    Rob

In Red Hat land, /usr/include/linux is provided by glibc-kernelheaders and 
the file version.h in that dir indicates (in mine anyway)
#define UTS_RELEASE "2.4.9-9"

glibc-kernelheaders is at a different version number than the standard 
glibc-* stuff.

Also, gnu seemes to condradict Linus' preference.  From
http://www.gnu.org/manual/glibc-2.2.3/html_chapter/libc_36.html#SEC693

Special advice for Linux systems
...
"Then rename or delete `/usr/include', create a new `/usr/include', and make 
the usual symbolic links of `/usr/include/linux' and `/usr/include/asm' into 
the 2.2 kernel sources."

So who knows?

Wouldn't you want /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin, etc? I'm in this 
situation with one HP box we have that we using their HP's OpenCall SS7 
software on. It's some sort of HP rolled RedHat Linux disto and as far 
as I know there's not really any kind of support for it. I've had to 
use the source and install a few updates myself into 
/usr/local[...]. This was especially true for things like OpenSSH since 
the HP box sports OpenSSH 3.1p1 by default (...Shudder...).

Supposedly HP's OpenCall software runs on RedHat Enterprise 2.1 and so 
I'm hopefully going to be able to flatten and redeploy the box with a 
supported version of Linux in the near future.

Yeah, I've tried, and foudn that with sdl the audio and video are
together, but it will randomly (about every 2 minutes) just freeze for
half a minute). I've tried all the available video drivers and xv works
best for me now (used to be xmga under 2.4)

> And which audio output plug-in are you using?

I thought I was using alsa9, because that's what's in my config file,
but it turns out I'm not, because it's not available. I'm using OSS. And
thanks for forcing me to find that problem -- I'm going to recompile
MPlayer soon, and get back to you.

I'm compiling now, and configure says it's finding libmpdvdkit and not
(libcss - oldstyle).

MPlayer uses it's own DVD stuff - it doesn't link against 3rd party
stuff already on your system unless you tell it to, and there's no good
reason to do that.

Just to be sure, you have alsa-lib installed, right?  :-)

It does, if it's built with OSS at all. But gmplayer remembers its settings.
So, if you have it installed, you can launch it, click on the wrench icon,
change the codecs and devices, and next time you can run it without any options
at all, just the file name or dvd title.

Well, I just got mplayer to use ao alsa9 (auto-apt is so incredibly
wonderful =), and now the sound is a lot better -- it seems to be
matched to the video -- but the video has become choppy. Ugh.

Aahhh, thanks!  I checked out /usr/include/linux/version.h and it says:

  #define UTS_RELEASE "2.4.22"

So, I guess I'm safe since I'm using 2.4.22.  Thanks for all your
research.

Why do you favor leaving as the solution?  I think Jeme is politically
motivated in a way that produces a great deal of abuse to the list.
I'm motivated to balance what he puts on the list because I know
many people for whatever reason can't filter.  I'm concerned 
about most of what he is pushing.  I've taken some time to try 
and go head to head with him on plug-talk, I consider him a very
dangerous man.  I'm not hard headed complaining about Jeme's pervert
post, there's another view that has been suppressed for far too long. 
I'm not interested in being in Jeme's world where a married woman calls
herself a pervert just to amuse him.  He says here on plug that she is
not demeaning herself, yet he falls short of offering an interpretation
she'd attribute to the word that satisfies that statement.  Instead, it
sounds like he wants to have an affair with her.

Leaving is a larger issue.  Oregon is my home of twenty two and a half
years where by removing my influence, however ineffective it may be, 
I see things degrading faster.  There's a lot to leave here.  If I 
stay with Linux and try to be a programmer in this area, this is a 
major list for the region focused on my core area of interest.  

I'm not crazy, there are enough bridges in Portland I could have 
jumped off of one a long time ago if I was.  Unfortunately, the
great and noble plug list would probably celebrate if I did even
though it's the stupidest thing I could ever consider doing.

I can see a school of thought (I'm not saying it exists) that would treat
/usr/local as the repository for custom versions of things that might
conflict with a shared /usr/bin or /bin, but I've never seen such a thing.

Usually, I've seen /usr/local used as a shared space for local executables
built by admin and non-admin staff for use in that environment.  That
meant, in these cases, that /usr/local was WRITABLE BY NON-ADMINS (usually
the staff group).  This opens you up to all kinds of trojans and
unintentional conflicts.

If /usr/local/bin precedes ANYTHING in your path, you should constantly
check to see if anything there has the same name as something from your
essential operating system packages (/sbin and /bin for sure, but probably
also /usr/sbin and /usr/bin).

Those are my bits.

Woah... not quite.  I may have missed some essential detail here, but all
that shows is what version of kernel headers you're using.  That doesn't
tell you which version your glibc was compiled against.

That is to say, you have to check that YOUR glibc was compiled against
THESE kernel headers.

Did I miss something?

I can't imagine how anything could be MORE of an olive branch or peace

I personally agree that kill-filing is more harmful than any other way of
dealing with problems.  It's burying your head in the sand.

Mostly, it's arrogance and overkill.  You are assuming that this person
you've blocked can never have anything useful to present to you.  And you
are destroying your own ability to benefit from even the posts that you
don't automatically find offensive.

It's a bad solution and I'm glad we agree.

That's exactly the question Eric presented to you and you were offended.

Now, see, here's the real problem.  You have this idea of "those who are
vulnerable".  You're implying there are people out there who cannot reason
for themselves and you must do their filtering for them.  I reject that
statement as grossly elitist and paternalist.

Trust people to do one of two things:  Care for themselves or ask for
help.  If they don't do that much, they cannot be helped.

There is no mission statement for the PLUG list.  Also, I believe freedom
is the watch-word around the Free Software movement, so being "ultra
liberal" (i.e. ultra free) is exactly the goal.

Policing and punishing and censoring are not alien concepts, they're just
extremely unpleasant.

There are a number of Linux/open source/free software user groups
in the Portland area. PLUG is by no means the sole forum for
programmers.

If one hopes to reap positive rewards from their influence within
the PLUG community, it would yeild the best results if such 
actions did not irritate the PLUG community. Think about it.

Rather than asking you, once again, to let this thread drop, I
will ask that you unplug your computer for a day, go to the park
or somewhere nice and quiet, and reflect on this: PLUG is a public,
archived forum. Think about it.

"Great and noble"?  PLUG is a chaotic bizarre, not a noble cathedral.

Wrong.  We are a Unix/Linux community...  Or is there no such thing
as an off topic post where it's really annoying pests read things 
they don't like on plug and then complain later ;-)  Do lack of
restrictions always equate to freedom?  I imagine if gravity were
taken away from the earth that a lot of people would be upset
with that, but it is technically a restriction.  If the list admin
blocked you occasionally, I'm not sure people would complain that
much though Mr. Brelin.  BTW, doesn't anyone who asks for help 
on plug list risk a diatribe from you Jeme.  

Is is possible that you are a unique pain in the neck on this
list where it is within your own unique style to post that a woman
called herself a pervert but that isn't derogatory where you still
haven't explained what non offensive thing she supposedly meant
for all the uneducated elitist punks out there ;-)

As far as people who can't reason for themselves, I nominate you
as president.  Wait a minute, you don't believe people reason
at all.  Didn't you once say we're all just chemical formulas?
You're world totally inhales.

Why would they when they would just subscribe and see your homophobic
and paranoid rantings? You managed to keep that crap on plug-talk for a
few days but you just couldn't resist bringing it back to the main list.

It's funny to see you spouting off about open-mindedness when you are
quick to criticize and flame anybody who doesn't share your narrow moral
view of the world.

It's actually a more community-friendly approach than yours is.  Why?
It allows each user to decide for themselves.  Hardline moderation
doesn't help this.

Censorship isn't diplomatic.

PLUG is a committee?  I thought it was a user group, more of a club
then a committee.

Easy to get a good estimate of the likely vote outcome right now.
Just go through this thread, see how many supporters you have (unique
people, not posts) and see how many detractors.  It appears you're
out-voted.

Nor should it have to.  You're supposed to keep the contents of your
killfile to yourself as to avoid influencing people to dodge killfiles
or making yourself look foolish publicly (I'm talking to you, those
who think posting *plonk* is amusing).

Since when are we responsible for your ego security?  Not that I side
with Jeme.  However, security is the responsibility of the individual.
The best way to defend yourself in this situation is to employ a
killfile.

PLUG works like an old-skool net community.  One of the points the net
used to be able to pride itself with is remarkable self-regulation.

First of all, welcome to the 'net, a perfect demonstration that
communism (as in, a cooperative anarchy) on a grand scale can work,
just not with the commodities of life.  You will encounter a very
live-and-let-live attitude while online.  If you're not comfortable
with this, stay to the mainstream where you're not expected to think
for yourself or form an opinion of your own.  If a dictatorship isn't
your bag, then lighten up and take the killfile option.

This really is a personal preference issue.  This, and not spam, is
why email sorting and filtering was originally created.

Meatspace doesn't have the capabilities to tune out outside noise like
killfiles, either.

It wasn't exactly a Freudian slip, though.  A *nice* Spoonerism that
only works in written form, though.

Oh crap, people write crap now.  Why do you want to share this 
image, without much detail I might add, with the whole group?

Anyone who wants gay marriage and the banning of heterosexual couples
would think I'm homophobic.  God forbid you run into someone who says
any restriction does not constitute an inappropriate barrier to personal
freedom.  I suppose I'm not any more annoying than Macneil Lehrer's Paul
and Gigot.  That young spectacled gay came out and said gays 
and lesbians should be encouraged to do whatever they want in the name
of "compassionate conservatism."  It certainly is easier to argue that 
people need gravity than it is to argue against the redefinition of
marriage or adding certain requirements to being "tolerant." :-)

Did Chuck Mize write this?  Is it possible some people don't want to be
kill filed so they're not putting nice signatures on their posts?

It would prefer if there weren't such a strong gay political movement
in Portland and Eugene.  Maybe it's the northern exposure or the rain
that's causing this.

So I'm burying my head in the sand if I don't turn on KOIN when CSI is
on, because I don't like CSI?  That's about what your saying amounts
to.

You're falsely assuming you can't filter out people speaking about a
particular subject, which you can also killfile.

Minor price to pay when it avoids the stress you're going through to
argue this point this far.

Everybody gave you a reasonable solution, though!  Being a part of a
community doesn't mean you have to read everything that arrives, or
agree with it.

Wait, wait, you're asking why you're being driven off when you're
forcing the issue on a problem that was solved in the 1970s?  Get off
your high horse.

So?  That would be their problem, not ours.

Constructive criticisim was offered.  You rejected the proposed
solution as "overkill," when in reality, it's putting all the control
and responsibility on yourself to cut things down to what you consider
on-topic.

> I've gotten hate mail though.

Hate mail?  You'll have to prove that.  I've seen people telling you
that there is a reasonable solution that you yourself control, but
apparently it's not good enough for you.

Being open-minded and courteous doesn't mean that we have to put up
with a headstrong newbie that doesn't understand the very things that
help keep communities like this open to all comers.

Sorry, I don't buy the bit that restrictions are the ultimate enemy to
having a successfull community.  Communism was implemented as a
totalitarian system in Russia: the state took care of you, distributed
the wealth in a non democratic fashion, owned all the property, and
totally banned religion.  Isn't Stalin Saddham's hero?  Anarachy doesn't
encourage people to come together which is divisive to groups, clubs,
societies...  I strongly question the opinion some seem to be trying
to push that Godlessness is the way to go and that anything goes because
this is the Internet.  If the Internet is a monster, this monster ought
to be tamed.  

In the interests of national security, if it is found out that someone
is lurking on this list with the sole intention of learning ways to
crack computer systems, that person should be blocked by the list
administrator.

Morality is not a personality preference.  Women should not be
called perverts in the common culture just as white caucausians 
should not be called honkeys and African Americans should not 
be called niggers.  The plug list can be assumed to include
people from common cultures.

One problem with not knowing who is kill filing you is that there
is no opportunity to work things out with them.  As far as Jeme's
offer to come see him.  I don't go see people I don't know and don't
trust but it's more than I've seen many others try to do.  As far as
going to a Portland's Forest Park, forget it.  Portland State makes 
me sick.

The otherwise attractive actresses in it have disappointing character:
their supposed morals and work history specifically.  That Grissom
character is really depressing.  He needs to get out more.  It's no 
Dr. Who or Willy Wonka, that's for sure.  At least it isn't Austin
Powers or 007.

I'm sick of the "national security" excuse used to all kinds of
unrealistic extremes.  If you think national security is something
that should override liberties, please wear a tinfoil hat so we know
who you are.

So killfile people using such terms.  If everybody does that, that
person is gauranteed to get very few, if any replies.  They suck
static and eventually leave.  Killfiling makes moderation a collective
and democratic process.  Refusing to killfile forfeits your vote.

So what?  Don't sweat the small stuff.  Another thing mail filters are

I do indeed believe in thinking a problem through. Thinking through
a problem, even one that you find to be deeply disturbing, counter-
intuitive, or just plain offensive, can be a fruitful excersize.

In this case, I have taken my three swings with the clue bat and
have earned a strike each time. The rules say I must now set the
clue bat down, walk back to the bench, and watch the next batter.

Best wishes Michael.

Interesting line of reasoning above. You start with Communism - which
was never implemented in Russia by the Soviet leaders' own admission.
Officially the Soviet Union was a socialist society with a goal of
becoming a true communist nation - in reality, arguments could be made
that it ranged from a dictatorship to an oligarchy.

Religion totally banned? I seem to recall that the Russian Orthodox
Church openly collaborated with the Soviet government in order to secure
its position as the only Soviet state recognized and supported religion.

Yes, by many accounts Saddam Hussein admired and tried to pattern his
rule after Joseph Stalin (and not after Osama bin Laden or the Taliban).
So? Stalin was a monster, and Hussein was a petty tyrant. Those facts
(or perhaps opinions) don't have anything to do with your argument.

And then you bring up Anarchy, and then Godlessness? Does any of this
have anything remotely to do with the question of whether the PLUG
mailing list should be moderated?

Tell us, Michael, do you think the question of list moderation should be
decided by some sort of democratic process? Would you be satisfied if
this was decided one way or the other by the wishes of majority of those
subscribed to this list, or should what is best for everyone be decided
by some smaller group, or perhaps an individual?

You could always recompile glibc against your installed kernel sources to be

one would experience with /usr/include/linux headers not matching glibc: 
page faults and other weirdness.  If the kernel's internal data structures 
change and glibc doesn't know, system binaries and user-land apps may scream 
in alien and painful ways.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0311291832080.14746-100000@onyx.spiritone.com>

A while back (in September) I upgraded my Mozilla to a later version (on 
Gentoo using emerge) and the fonts in KDE seemed to disappear after that 
(either I would see little empty squares where letters should be or menus 
were just empty).  I've been using ICEwm in the meantime and it seems OK.  
But I tried to run Lyx the other day and it could only find a fixed font...  
So now I'm motivated again to try to figure out what's going on.

I've looked around on the web and found a few suggestions that editing 
/etc/fonts/fonts.conf and changing the order that it searches font 
directories could help - but I haven't had luck with this.

Now I'm curious about fonts.conf - it's an xml file so I'm thinking that 
some program actually reads it at some point and does something with it.  
Does this happen once during booting or is it read all the time by 
various programs that need to find fonts?  Can anyone explain how 
fonts.conf is used?

So what actually is using the kernel headers? Are they needed only when
you're compiling new binaries from source, or are there some cases of
run-time dependency on them?

As far as I have seen, it has been one individual who wishes to add
moderation to the PLUG list... I haven't seen anybody agree with him,
only people raise points against moderation.

I tried to divert the thread to CSI, and then twice to editor wars, but
neither seems to be taking.  :-)

> Would not an on-line polling system do?

Due to the nature of PLUG, such a thing would really need to be
anonymous.  I haven't yet met an anonymous polling system that wasn't
*very* easily broken.

I, personally, feel moderation begins at home.  It's quite easy to
filter folks out as punishment.  Then, one must be more careful to stay
on topic, themselves.  The starter of the first moderation thread, IMHO,
would be one of the first few individuals to find themselves moderated
off the list for a cooldown period.

If their fax machine dumps to a computer rather than paper all you'll do

Browse the dynamic page you want to validate and save a copy of it.
In mozilla, for example, do File -> Save Page As (Ctrl-S)... to save a
web page. Copy the page in question to http://yoursite.com/testpage.html
and run the validator against that.

I asked her this too.  Compiling a driver will definitly need that info.
(Think vendors that release binary-only drivers, stupid because everytime 
the kernel changes, they have to recompile and release a new binary.)

And her guess was that anything should be able to count on 
/usr/include/linux since it's exposed.  Anything that looks to 
/usr/src/linux is not playing by the rules and is likely to be disappointed.

One person's rights end where the next person's nose begins.  At times,
a community agreeing certain statements or opinions are offensive may
find in order to maintain itself that it is necessary to collectively
denounce these ideas.
 
Democracy is not always helpful.  True democracy in the form of the
Confederate government our nation started with failed.  It was only
with a stronger central government that we have become the nation 
we are today.  The noise level on plug is very high.  Kill filing
ignores the noise, if that noise is widespread enough this apporach 
ultimately leads to abandoning the list altogether.  Governments
that are not democratic if they recognize human rights and allow
religious freedom have their place.  This nation is a representative
republic, not a democracy.

Aside.  The people who can help you aren't always people you'd agree
with anything else on.  As a compromise, many communities avoid
controversial problem areas.  Instead, I see evidence plug is as
much a target of political activity as it is a place for people to
try to help each other out informally with Linux or Unix problems.

There were religious problems under Russian communism, more Catholics
were murdered during the rise of communism than all the Jews killed
in all the German concentration camps combined throughout World War 
II. The world appears to have forgotten or ignored this.  There are
incredible stories about the bricks of churches destroyed when 
communism began resurfacing after it's fall for use in the construction 
of new ones.  Communism lasted 70 years starting with a mass genocide.
The Soviet Union was not friendly to religion at all, it also wasn't
family friendly experimenting with breaking them up and replacing the
father with the state.

The Internet can create problems as much as it can solve them.  People
don't come together without a certain amount of trust and mutual respect
established.  This is where diplomacy is helpful.  It also leads to one
of the secrets of peace: people who are talking and are on good terms
are less able to hate each other and make war.  Kill filing is a cop
out because the community really doesn't want to limit this list to
what is really germane to Linux and Unix moving fringe or possible
fringe stuff out to plug-talk.  A great deal of improved could be 
had by justing redirecting certain posts elsewhere where anyone could
get around that filtering by being on both lists.

First of all, thanks for making me get off my ass and finish LDAP/KRB5
integration on my client box so I could test all this for you. ;-)

Write performance can vary for a number of parameters. Principally,
sync/async will affect write performance. However, async can be
dangerous, it can degrade performance with respect to usage patterns
involving lots of small files, and most importantly: nfs3 wouldn't mount
with it. :-) But Linux' nfs server is notorious for be "less" than, say,
the well-regarded Solaris server. Anyhoo. Other parameters involving
performance affect read performance, too.

Here we go.

Configuration details:

Host   - Dual P3-Xeon 500/2MB, Alteon Fibre Gigabit, 3x120GB hardware RAID5
Client - Dual P3-Xeon 500/1MB, Alteon Fibre Gigabit

File-system was formatted using reiserfs, originally. Fibre was
connected back-to-back.

Socket buffer limits were lifted dramatically, thusly:

echo 262144 > /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max
echo 262144 > /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max

(With this option, you can specify, e.g., socket buffers in samba of
128K [or higher] and get rather impressive performance boost. There are
cases where this may not be optimal or safe, depending on [especially]
hardware and usage patterns -- it is, however, a must for gigabit
environments.)

I also increased MTU to 6000, but this is a feature of optical gigabit,
to enable Jumbo Frame support.

Testing methodology was to attempt to keep a relatively consistent
environment while performing bonnie benchmarks from the client. Per-
char benchmarks were omitted as were file-oriented benchmarks. These are
both very important, but they take a lot of time to perform this many
times. ;-)

A "local" score is provided to show bonnie performance on the host
machine without going through nfs. Additionally, hdparm -t rates this
array at 22MB/sec.

It is very important to understand that it doesn't matter how fast your
network is, if your hard drive is slow. All of the following discussion
will only be made in terms of the original local score. In fact, the
network in this scenario was so fast, it was essentially removed as a
variable from consideration.

(Note that if you don't have a fixed font in your email client, that the
following will look pretty wacky.)

nfs3-262144          4982   8  4790  22 15424  20 164.1   4

Some things to understand: NFSv2 doesn't allow rsize/wsize buffers over
8192 (well, it does, but it is highly discouraged, and in my experience
really, really strange stuff begins to happen). Also, the rule of thumb
on Linux is that for NFSv2 your rsize/wsize should match your hardware's
page size. On ia32 this will be 4096. On most other, and particularly
64-bit architectures, this will be 8192. Note that this bears out
above -- NFSv2 benchmarks at 8192 are worse, in general. This is not
true for NFSv3. Also, remember that this system is live, so there will
be fluctuations in the above numbers. Assume that a <5% difference is
insignificant, and don't be amazed that one of the tests over NFS
outperformed the local benchmark. ;-)

I was intrigued by how NFSv3 performance actually got better as
rsize/wsize got larger. So I kept going for a while. Performance seemed
to taper out at around 32768. At this point, reads were essentially
local, although writes were still half of performance. Again, as
discussed above, this may be because of the "sync" option with regards
to the NFS server. It is entirely possible that in a similar
configuration, the client would be able to get much closer to local
performance if the host were Solaris-based. Still, 5MB/sec ain't bad.
:-)

It should be stressed again, that these numbers represent my own
environment and my own benchmarking. Your needs and results will vary.
Also, none of this really answers your question. :-) On a 100MB/sec
network, however, with actual outside traffic, I'd expect read
performance to be closer to 8MB/sec and write performance similar. Your
system is *similar* in performance to my hosts, and as long as it isn't
overly loaded (mine is oversubscribed on swap, due to UML's, for
example) you should certainly not see CPU-bound performance in any way,
whatsoever. It's your hard drive that matters.

I hope you find this useful. (As well as others.)

System calls will likely be affected by this quite a bit.

Why do corporations, schools, and small business have standards of what
can and can't be transmitted through their electronic infrastructure?
Structure can help stem flame posting and make this list more 
peaceful.  You don't question which side of the road to drive on
when cars are coming the other way do you?  To a certain degree, I'd say
people are trying to do the same with plug.  This is where using a
coomunity based filter makes sense.  If nothing is blocked but
questionable posts are only redirected to plug-talk, it's really only a
matter of people subscribing to both lists if they don't agree with the
moderator.  Right now, a majority can't vote at the plug site that a
thread is too OT and should be stopped, this to me is something that
really ought to be considered.
 
Why should I be subjected to the bias of plug?  Why should I leave
because there might be a bias?  In the end I see I'm not being given
very many choices here.  If I kill file the people who respond most
often, I've basically left anyways.  Kill filing does offer me any
way to say I have a problem with what someone is posting, it's just
ignoring them.

I've been biting my tongue, but you just won't stop.  There are hundreds of 
subscribers on this list and you are doing nothing but going against the 
grain.  Please stop.

Forget the people that respond most often.  Think about the people that 
haven't said anything and are waiting for naptime to come.

Who gets to moderate?  It's an onerous duty.

I seem to remember another call to bell the cat fairly recently.
Amazingly enough, it may've been by the same individual.

It would indeed not, for the same reasons we don't run our elections
over the web.  A show of hands at the next meeting might do.  This could
be led by the fellow demanding it here.  Mind, I don't recall ever
seeing him at a meeting...

I'm begining to think that this one (Mr. Robinson AA) is a troll.

you to read plug. You signed up voluntarily. You continue to read the 
posts voluntarily. You continue to contribute voluntarily. If you don't 
like it, stop volunteering! If plug is doing you so much harm, why are 
you tolerating it? Why are you contributing to it?

I have some theories, but I'll keep them to myself for now...

Because you're the one that has the problem with "the bias" (which the 
rest of us are, oddly enough, oblivious too, but for the sake of 
argument (sigh), we'll say it exists). The rest of us don't. Flow with 
it or go elsewhere.

Leave or stay. Those are your choices.

Who the hell told you that plug was obligated to give you choices about 
what gets posted to the list? You act like your entitled to them or 
something. Nobody here owes you anything.

So why not just take the leap and leave then?

This is a technically-oriented (more specifically, linux-oriented) list. 
If your problem with a post goes beyond a debate on technical merits 
("No, you idiot, that answer is completely wrong and will cause six 
nuclear reactors to simultaneously explode!") then you best be replying 
off-list, because I promise, nobody else wants to hear it. If you really 
need to debate that crap in a public forum, feel free to ask for someone 
to create plug-christian-ethics, or whatever the hell it is you think 
you're arguing about. Leave the rest of us to explore technical issues.

By the way, please consider using a spell checker on outgoing email from 
now on. It's quite helpful to those of us who have to wade through your 
spew.

Now go away, bothersome insect.

OVER To a slightly more on-topic topic, just how do you >/dev/null mail 
in procmail? Can I just use /dev/null as a mailbox? Q-Mail vomited last 
time I tried that (though I found the trick to doing it with some 
research - fill the alias file with only a comment). I'd much like this 
thread to end, weather or not people continue to reply to it.

Something like:

:0
* Subject:.*No to moderation
/dev/null

??

Also, can anybody point to any decent procmail documentation? The 
procmail site doesn't seem to have much, and though I've found a few 
good guides out there, none seem to be comprehensive, and always leave 
me with questions.

I don't believe so or at least not a full-time troll. He does ask
questions and seem genuinely interested in the answers.

Having said that Mr Robinson needs to realize that the overall opinion
seems to be massively against him on this issue, and he needs to drop it.
He favors kill files, and I wouldn't be surprised to find that he appears
in quite a few at this point.

If there was a system where people could vote on a killing a thread
instead, you could vote and not post at all.  If there is a grain there
are informal community standards, what are they?  The ability to veto
a thread if the thread dies when enough people agree is 
a very interesting idea.  Why am I told to stop yet I haven't heard
Jeme, Holger, Carla, Michael Rasmussen or anyone else who lengthened
this thread get told to stop?  If I could vote for a thread kill 
instead of replying to one I don't like, maybe I wouldn't catch so 
much flak.  This way my views have a chance to balance other views
without causing anywhere near as much anger.  Course I'm assuming 
people have open minds where accusations I'm going against the grain
don't suggest that at all.  

Is it so important for voting to be anonymous?  I vote for no more posts
that are likely to be ambiguous with words that are commonly viewed as
offensive on plug.  If anywhere, these post should go to plug-talk
instead.  I also ask that Jeme stop indulging in language commonly
viewed as offensive and attempt to present himself in a more
subdued manner or post more of his stuff on plug-talk, if
anywhere, instead.

Um, it WAS a Freudian Slip.  A spoonerism is when you reverse the first
consonant sounds of two words like "balking tackwards".

I've been to a plug meeting, I didn't understand much about the 
quick books presentation that was given though.  I wasn't 
impressed with the sarcasm I ran into nor the small turnout 
either.  I don't like being in Smith Hall at PSU, traumatic 
stress issues.  I believe pdxlug.org is trying some sort of 
moderation.  It's inconvenient to go to Portland where I 
don't like the City a whole lot.  I don't agree with comments 
that those who don't attend the meetings but do use the 
mailing list aren't really part of the community.  The fact
is that I don't feel safe at PSU and probably never will.

Which is what mature people do with pesky people instead of whine,
bitch, and moan that someone's not censoring everything for your
consumption.  You're demonstrating that you're afraid or incapable for
thinking for yourself.

While that absolutely SHOULD work, I think you're having a problem with
the fact that /dev/null is a file and your system is expecting a maildir.
Is that right?

I don't use maildir and I have company right now, but if there's no answer
to this later tonight, I'll take alook.

> Also, can anybody point to any decent procmail documentation?

man procmail
man procmailrc

Both of those are really, really good.

We'd all be pretty happy to help with specifics.

My behavior is not a subject for democratic rule.

If you'd like to give me a good REASON (in private, as I assume everyone
would prefer), go right ahead.

This could be something we discussed in person.  We could find a nice,
public place where you felt safe.  Maybe you could come to a meeting and
we could talk there.

So you agree with everybody to just use killfiles then.  Thank you.
Now move on.

Should have lurked before posting then.  Consider taking a newbie

Is there a admin for the list?

If so we could have a vote by email. Say, everyone subscribed as of today
has 7 days to send a choice into the admin if they want moderation or not.

There's I-5.  I'll help load the truck when you decide to move and fix

I don't favor kill files.  I favor a community approach instead of
a plug that is the seedy armpit of the world.  Maybe there 
is a reason this isn't viewed as an official Linux user group 
where pdxlug.org is with it's anyone can be kicked off policy.  
If anyone gets away with posting a set of opinions out in full 
onto plug that I don't agree with it, but noone else gets a good 
counter piece out there, that lends itself to trolling on my 
part for lack of a better choice than do nothing about this
bias.

There might have been a time when a man wouldn't be
brutally attacked for saying that's not my opinion and 
I want you to know it.  Or he might get killed, but at 
least if he truly believed he was right that merits some 
admiration of his courage.  Being democratic isn't always 
helpful when it comes to people communicating affectively 
with one another.  Destroy trust and miss common ground, 
it's all over.  The greek war tragedies during some of 
their democracy experiments come to mind too.  It easier
to defeat an army if the leaders of it can't decide what
to do.

I do believe in setting a good example where I ask for 
consideration about the example that is set by what 
slips onto plug regardless of what people kill file 
or not.  If someone from outside receives the plug 
list without filtering it, what does that person get?  
Is is something to be proud to be associated with, 
or is it something where you where you wish your 
email address that shows up in your posts couldn't 
be traced to you?

Is this list a "corporations, schools, and small business"?? No. And it
would be a detriment to the list to run it as such.

I've said it before... "In your opinion". The same structure that you
are asking for, also tends to stifle creativity.

This isn't a road. It's a mailing list where YOU have control over what
comes into YOUR mailbox. If YOU choose to not control it, don't force
the rest of us to suffer with you.

Again, I ask. WHO should make that decision for everyone on the list? I
for one, would rather have the power to choose for myself, rather than
have someone (or a group) decide for me.

So control it on your own system, and you get exact control. You don't
have to wait for a majority to decide it's off topic (if that ever
happens). When you decide it's enough, it stops.

> Why should I be subjected to the bias of plug?

How are you? Do you not have control over exactly what comes into your
inbox? 

If you place the control into the hands of one or more moderators, then
you effectively are making yourself subjected to bias of another.

Quite the opposite. You are given FULL control. If the list were
moderated, then you LOSE control.

Exactly. But you DO realize you can killfile on a name, as well as a
subject or whatever other attribute you want.

It's not that I can't think for myself.  The content of the plug list
can be viewed as setting a certain example where I wonder, do I want to
be connected with that example a and can I influence it all and remain
a good community member b?

I've not actually tried it yet. But yes, I am using Maildir.

I once tried to do something similar with qmail, and it puked becuase it 
attempts to open /dev/null as if it were a regular file, which of 
course, dosn't happen.

(Glancing at the man page, it looks like this isn't a problem for 
procmail, so I'll give it a shot.)

Don't worry about it too much. This thread should die soon, anyway. If

snaps and shoots Michael. ;)

Hell, if this works, I won't even see any further replies.

I tend to think of man pages as references rather than howto's, but I'll 
give it a look, since I know that's not by any means universal truth. I 
hadn't thought to try procmailrc as a manpage, either. :)

Also, is there a way to reliably filter by sender? I read somewhere that 
^From:.*<whoever> wasn't a reliable. Any truth to that?

Thanks!

Maybe because you are the only one calling for moderation on this list?

At least, I don't see anyone else on that side of the question. 

Everyone else that I've seen (and I've read nearly every message in the
thread) has beat you over the head with the clue stick, but you refuse
to listen.

No no no.  I oppose kill files and favor a community filter
that everyone can shape through voting.  Kill files are extreme
and do nothing to help people work together in ways they may
not easily see also raising the potential of a list user
missing something important.

Don't pick on newbies and maybe plug will get more of them.

That's just contradictory.  Killfiles can filter on practically any
criteria you can think of, and some systems even allow you to weigh it
with scores.

> Don't pick on newbies and maybe plug will get more of them.

That's not a problem.  Normally, we also don't have newbies like you
refusing to learn from other list subscribers.

Who addresses the fact that even being seen on the list 
can set an example?  Filtering for parts of it offers no way 
to control what influence even having my name on the list can 
have on those who looks at what I don't agree with. Others 
have no way of knowing there are things I don't agree with 
on here, they only know if my name is on here.   

I decide not to troll to put a challenging opinion out to one 
that has gotten onto plug which I don't agree with... I might 
keep people "happy", the list is still likely going to be left 
with a strong bias and my name on it though.
  
It is a shame noone has said they care what example this list 
they put their name on may set for others.  The lack of 
recognition for a social responsibility is very disconcerting.

What you are perceiving as abuse is reality. Nearly every post I've read
has said the same thing in one form or another. If that is not
metaphorically beating someone over the head with the clue stick, I
don't know what is.

Note, *I* did not say that *I* was beating you over the head. I'm saying
you are not reading the messages or accepting the opinions of the
majority of the posts in this thread. 

You are bringing on any "abuse" you are getting yourself. You have taken
on this crusade and now you are trying to convince the rest of us that
you are right and everyone else is wrong. 

As someone else said, you need to accept the words of the majority and
deal with it.

YOU DO!

If you don't like it. You control wether you are associated with the
list or not. 

The rest of us (at least those that have responded to this thread) don't
seem to have a problem with it.

I'm NOT telling you to leave. I'm telling you that you have a choice.
Accept the list the way it is, or leave.

Yes, you are allowed to make suggestions, which you did. This one was
beat to death, and now is a dead horse. Keep beating it if you wish.

I refuse to kill file anyone (at least so far in my 23 years online and
21 years on the Internet and its predecessor). Although, just like
yourself, I have gotten fed up with the political screeds on this list
and blasted the author. In that particular case, both of us shut up for
awhile and the conversation about Linux and related subjects resumed.

At any rate, I don't killfile anyone because I although I may vehemently
disagree with someone, such as yourself, doesn't mean that they don't
ever have anything constructive to say.

Therefore, I force myself to read your posts on the off chance that you
may enlighten me on something relevant to Linux or computing in general.

So far, I have been disappointed. But I have hope.

Do you really favor a "community" approach? It seems the community
concensus favors an unmoderated mailing list.

Official? Did we forget to pay our Official Linux Group registration

pdxlug.org been officially sanctioned by the Official Linux Sanctioning

I am really enjoying this topic, it is providing great entertainment.

My thought was that it's trying to write to a directory called /dev/null
rather than just append data to the file.

I haven't tried it, either.

Yeah, sometimes there are man pages for rc files.  They're usually pretty
good, too.

apropros (man -k) is your friend.

Yes.

There's a whole section in the procmailrc manpage about varios FROM
options.  Here's the excerpt about the type I use:

       If the regular expression contains `^FROM_DAEMON' it will
       be substituted by `(^(Mailing-List:|Precedence:.*(junk
       |bulk|list)|To: Multiple recipients of |(((Resent-)?(From
       |Sender)|X-Envelope-From):|>?From )([^>]*[^(.%@a-
       z0-9])?(Post(ma?(st(e?r)?|n)|office)|(send)?Mail(er)?
       |daemon|m(mdf|ajordomo)|n?uucp|LIST(SERV|proc)|NETSERV
       |o(wner|ps)|r(e(quest|sponse)|oot)|b(ounce|bs\.smtp)|echo
       |mirror|s(erv(ices?|er)|mtp(error)?|ystem)
       |A(dmin(istrator)?|MMGR|utoanswer))(([^).!:a-z0-9][-_a-
       z0-9]*)?[%@>\t ][^<)]*(\(.*\).*)?)?$([^>]|$)))', which
       should catch mails coming from most daemons (how's that
       for a regular expression :-).

So there you go.  Use '^FROM_DAEMON' instead of 'From:'.

Michael,

I'm growing tired of your non-Linux related postings and thought I'd 
share with you what my search by sender name revealed when I searched 
my PLUG email folder for your name.

Reality Check:

You've made at least 18 postings today (11/29) and as far as I can see 
none of them appear to relate to Linux IMHO. All I can say is what an 
amazing group the PLUG'ers are for not having you banned by now. I've 
witnessed my share of users being banned from other LUG lists for being 
far less annoying than what you've managed to be over the last few 
days.

If you'd like the list to be moderated that would be great if it would 
keep people like you from making so many off topic postings in a single 
day. Please do me a favor and make an honest to goodness posting about 
Linux for a change. I know myself and probably everyone else on this 
list would be grateful to read and respond to a subject that interests 
us.

If my request is too much to ask, then I seariously ask that you 
consider staying away from your computer for a whole day and do 
something else. Take a walk in the park, see a movie, visit with 
friends, etc. but do something that takes your mind of all of your 
rantings you've posted here and give yourself a chance to cool off.

Thank you,

Tony

P.S. I looked back farther than today in my folder search and at one 
time you were capable of making postings that were on topic for this 
list.

Ok... this may not be my last post in response to your threads, Michael,
but this is the last night I'm reading them - if I see more crap like
this tomorrow, you're going to /dev/null with our other troll.

As far as I can see, what you're asking for is the police.  Now, I am
all in favor of the police for a large public.  We don't, however, need
List Police.  In small communities, there are these things called
'norms' ... unofficial rules we most all abide by.  They aren't written
down.  There's no formal enforcement.  If you violate the norms, you end
up in killfiles.

What you seem to want is a system of punishments for individuals you
disagree with.  This ain't cool for something like a mailing list.  When
we're talking about people behaving recklessly or doing harm to one
another, then a system of punishments probably makes sense.  If we're
discussing technical topics on a mailing list and somebody gets off
topic (gee, like this thread?) such a system is way overboard.  Why
punish when you can make the offender vanish for you?

I believe the outcry against your idea has shown PLUG doesn't want
moderation.  If you feel there needs to be some Newbie-friendly LUG
mailing list that's all moderated, see if PDXLUG is close enough for
you... and if not, start your own LUG.  More power to you.

If you're getting sick of posters here, GET RID OF THEM!  That's what I
do.  You're going to be gone if you keep up with this bullshit.

Adios.  Sleep well.

Mr. Michael C. Robinson,

Can you imagine the anger of a community at the individual who argues
for the use of a tool when:
a.	The community as functioned well with out the tool for 2
decades.
b.	The community, by definition, doesn't want the tool.
c.	The individual advocating the use of the tool INSISTS on
providing daily examples of why the tool is needed?

Your behavior on PLUG during the last few days is similar to the fellow
who expects gratitude from a home owner after he throws a brick
advertising his windows repair business through the home owner's window.
The fellow is SHOCKED when the home owner calls the police and demands
that the fellow vacate the home owner's property.

Can you understand this?  Currently, YOU, MICHAEL C. ROBINSON, are
having a SEVERE NEGATIVE EFFECT on the PLUG.  

Please stop.

If you find that you were not your self for the last three days for some
reason, I strongly recommend you apologize to Jeme, Carla, Russ, Paul,
and all the other PLUG members that you've insulted.  They *all* seem
like reasonable people too me.  I'd bet they are willing to forgive and
move on.

Thanks,
Erik.

I think it is pretty clear that the answer to the question does Michael

Now that we have settled that, GO AWAY!

Michael Robinson wants a moderated PLUG list.  There is a very easy
way to do this.  He can start another mailing list, moderate it 
himself, and include and exclude any posting he pleases.  If he wants to
talk about his classes, textbooks, gays, communism, CSI(?), or any other
subject that flits through his head, or exclude me or Jeme or AthlonRob
or Carla or Eric or anyone else, he is free to do that too.  He can
finance it with teeshirts - I would be proud to wear a teeshirt that
says "My Postings are Rejected by Michael Robinson".

I am a relative newcomer to this list myself, and I suppose if I was
NetGod I would design it differently.  But I'm not, and where the 
reality differs from my expectations I am learning to moderate my
expectations.  The really wonderful thing about the plug list is how
well it works with no moderation at all.  Out of dozens of lists I
have worked with over the last two decades, only one other has worked
as well, and that with occasional ejections of the obstreperous.

I read the digested list, and it is fractionally harder to killfile
Michael Robinson or Jeme Breslin.  Which has turned out OK;  every
once in a while Jeme comes up with something useful and I am glad I
haven't missed it.  As Jeme matures, his signal-to-noise ratio will
improve, and perhaps Michael Robinson's will leave the zero peg
where it is now.  So un-moderated has my vote;  I want to be present
when Michael finally has something useful to say, or when he learns
that is is his infantile behavior rather than some defect in the entire
rest of the world that brings on the relatively restrained criticism
he finds so objectionable.

The most important thing anyone here can do to improve the quality of
the plug list they read is improve the quality of their own postings.  
If Michael Robinson wants to see a better list, he has a lot of 
opportunities completely under his own control.  And if, with the
impatience of immature youth, he wants a better list "right now only",
he is free to moderate his own.

And thanks to all the rest of you that have shown remarkable restraint
in discussing this.  I think I will let it go with this posting (which
follows a private one to M.R.), as this discussion will never end until
M.R.  feels he has had the last word.  Let him have it, because his own
words do more to scuttle the idea moderation than anything the rest of
us can do.

Once you learn the rules, validation is trivial.  Every one of the things
I saw as errors on WVLUG, I could have found without the validator.

The problem is, most people don't learn the rules.  They just jiggle
the handle until the flushing noise stops (as in, it looks good in their
error-correcting browser).

Learn the rules.  Validation is trivial after that.  Get the coding
right, upload your site to your staging area (you *do* have one of
those, right?)  and then use the validator as a final check.  You
should never get any surprises at validation time.

You know I did find his musings on software engineering somewhat
amusing.  Much the way I find watching the Three Stooges doing plumbing
amusing,  Though I have this slight suspicion that the Three Stooges
were aware of the fact that they new next to nothing about plumbing and
were performing for our amusement.

This, & Russell's later patch was applied to the relevant parts of the
PLUG website Wednesday. I made a few minor changes (e.g., Redhat was
misspelled, I used collect/collection for aggregate/aggregation), but
nothing that I hope alters the intent of the submissions.

And I apologize to Ed for having his name misspelled on the Web page
for so long!

(Sorry for the delay, both in applying the submissions -- & for the

Give the man a cigar. Or a CD containing his favorite distro.

The problems with moderating any list are as follows:

* Someone has to read every post. That would be a full-time job, & most
likely an unpaid full-time job. Which leads to the next point,

* Eventually people & subject lines will be automatically banned. No
matter how it is done, eventually for the sake of saving time the
moderator will end up doing this.

At the best, this will be an incovenience: because a thread with the
subject line "A Newbie's Question about Sendmail", newbies will find it
difficult to ask about Sendmail. At worst, it will lead to a nasty
fight when Ezekiel Nutjob [1] is banned because of his insistence that
one cannot know about Linux unless one has the proper understanding of
how the Greys from Rigel IV were involved in the Kennedy Assassination.

* Another problem is the possibility that a moderator will act
arbitrarily to promote her/his own agenda, for example banning all
questions about BSD or Slackware as ``irrelevant". If one is donating
long hours to this task, the temptation will rear its ugly head.

I'm sure there are other problems that can be mentioned (Eric Harrison
mentioned a very good one above: loss of alternative, & potentially
valuable viewpoints), but the existence of an unmoderated mailling list
leads to the issue of filtering one's inbox.

I see this as a valuable right of every individual. While everyone has
Freedom of Speech -- including Ezekiel Nutjob -- everyone also has the
complementry right Not to Listen. (And if you disagree with this, when
was the last time you read word of the spam you received?)

Having said all of that, I'm about to discuss something that probably
has been in the back of everyones' minds here.

If it should happen that someone is so interfering with this maillist
that its survival is endangered, obviously that person will be banned
from this maillist. That having been said, I (for one) don't see it
happening yet, & I hope (for one) that it doesn't happen without
an overt discussion & clear warnings to the person in question.

Some may see this as a warning; I mean this as stating a simple fact.
If a subscriber's MTA starts an uncontrolled spew of gibberish onto
the PLUG list, that subscriber would obviously be banned. If you accept
that premise, then it follows if a subscriber's contributions keep
us from discussing Linux, UNIX, & related topics, then that subscriber
will be banned.

I don't want to go down that road -- now or ever. But we can.
I hope all of us consider things like netquette, reasonableness, &
politeness as we continue to contribute to this mailing list, otherwise
we will find ourselves going down that road.

Learning the rules isn't the problem, I know them, they're easy.  Not 
every web application is a weblog or slash clone, some are more complex 
and are non-trivial tasks to validate by hand.

Interesting thought.  One of the most random sources of bits I have access to 
has to be the PLUG list.  Cool, I think I'll see if I can write a /dev/random 
driver for it!  Hmm, might suck to find out that I lose the random device 
when my ISP goes down.

Still, on a more serious note, has anyone actually looked at using something 
like Usenet to generate random data?  It has to be a huge pool of entropy.  
Perhaps the alt.binaries.* lists should be avoided, but mailing lists and 
non-binary news groups should have significant entropy.  I guess you'd also 
want to remove all quoted material (repetition can't be that good for the 
entropy level).

You wouldn't get very many bits of entropy per message, but you'd have so much 
raw data!

Best,
Kyle

I suspect linguistic character and word 'distance' would pretty
predictable from language to language. If anything you *would* want to
include binaries. Now, as a matter of *active* (i.e., beginning right
now) random data analysis, you could measure message injection rates
and latency (here or on USENET) on a per-group/list basis.

Heh.  Me too.  A recent flamewar on Linux-Elitists produced this:

  If you don't know how to code, then you don't know how to design the

Holger was suggesting the notation on ALL off-topic posts including those
threads created in the future.

But you won't ever read this, so never mind.  Enjoy your ignorant world.

Paul wasn't suggesting you killfile people.  He was suggesting you
filter based on References or In-Reply-To headers, killing Offtopic

Subject: [PLUG] Presentation Software
Message-ID: <1070244863.9828.7.camel@dell.linux.box>

I need to get a presentation together for a class here in the next few
days... a PowerPoint style presentation.  It needs to be shown on a
projector hooked up to one of PSU's Windoze computers in a classroom.

I have KOffice installed here, so figured I'd just use kpresenter.  I
just now tossed together a few test slides and was a bit disappointed in
the quality of the HTML output - it spat out some ugly webpages with
large JPEG's as the slides, themselves.

I know I've seen some much nicer presentations in HTML format at PLUG
meetings... and just assumed there was a utility y'all used for them,
rather than coding by hand... what do you, personally, use for such
thing?

Other options I've considered include Knoppix-booting the system, but
I'm unsure of how the projector is set up or how it would work with
knoppix, and don't have the ability to do a dry-run, unfortunately...
and... I still have 10GB of wasted space.. errr.. Windows on this hard
drive, I could always reboot and see if I have PowerPoint itself...
*sigh*....

Any thoughts?

Rob

I've used OpenOffice Impress for some presentations, though I generally
use the application to print slides rather than on-screen HTML.

I'm not an expert on making presentations by any stretch of the
imagination, but for my 99% text slides it works well.

Rob,

  OpenOffice.org has a presentation component, but I've never used it. I've
always used magicpoint on linux for my slide shows.

Um, I'm opposed.   But, are we actually voting here?  Maybe we should just vote on whether to ban young Mr. Robinson.  (Just for a while?)

While I'm at the mic', though, I'd like to suggest we all stop responding to Robinson's self-righteous, troll-like drivel.  If you feel like returning fire, just email him directly.  I did, and I felt much better for it.  I figure if the clue-stick doesn't work offlist, it won't work onlist either.

Far as I can tell, he unsubscribed.

Now let the damn thread die.

Thanks for the advice, though!
