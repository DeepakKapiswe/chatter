Not for tonight, but I have recruited a speaker for the advanced

A willing speaker? What sort of lies did you have to tell?

Simple shame (I'd asked this person 2 years ago and she'd begged off
then with the excuse that she had just started the job), and appeal to
the public spirit.

Subject: [PLUG] fonts on browser
Message-ID: <0E2F9B6B-3BCC-4798-9807-915D3A2A1FFD@ridenbaugh.com>

I tried solving one font problem and ended up with a new one.

Running Linux Mint (current edition), dual-booted with Windows XP, I  
wanted to import fonts from Windows; the lack of some comparable  
fonts are a bar to some of the desktop publishing I do. So I copied  
the fonts directory in XP (that is, windows/fonts) over to a memory  
stick, thence to the Linux side of the machine at usr/share/fonts.  
New fonts did show up (though not all, a couple I hoped for did not  
materialize) in the Open Office docs I opened.

But, when I went to use Firefox and Galeon, no text of any sort  
showed up in the browser window - only web wage images and design.  
The problem doesn't seem to extend to other programs - the Tomboy  
notes program, for example, seems to operate as normal.

I suppose (I hope) I can reverse this by deleting the fonts directory  
I just copied over. But I'm wondering if there's a way to get the  
fonts to work in all of these places. Or is there something about  
what I did that would cause the installation to work in OO but not in  
the browsers?

I have a very simple bash script which wants an argument.  I would like to
source it.  I find that if I source it from another script using its
relative path it works fine--the argument is received.  If I source it using
its full path no argument is received.  A simple test is:

script1.sh:
#! /bin/sh
echo "Argument = $@"

script2.sh:
#!/bin/sh
. <full path>/script1.sh full
. <relative path>/script1.sh relative

The result show no argument received in the full case.

Ideas?

On another system sh -> bash, so that I just assumed...

what is dash, he asks, and wonders if it bears on this issue.

You might want to try using bash, /bin/sh is normally bourne shell or
dash not bash.

If you are trying to send an argument from script2 to script1 then you 
should not need to use the dot (.) - the modifications below should do 
the trick ... or did I miss something?
Regards
Fred James

cript1.sh:
#! /bin/sh
echo "Argument = $1"

script2.sh:
#!/bin/sh
<full path>/script1.sh full
<relative path>/script1.sh relative

bash 3.2 on my system doesn't show this problem.  are you sure the full 
path and relative path actually get to the same script?  could you be 
accidentally running two different scripts?  or maybe it is some odd 
bash bug, what version do you have?

Since /etc/gdm/PostSession/Default is a .sh script, I must use that shell,
also known as dash.  Maybe bash will not show the problem.  I have version
3.2.48(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu).

with bash, but with dash.   But my problem remains.  I need to use dash, and
the policy wants the script to be sourced.  My only solution at this time is
to have a separate script with the argument coded into it.  I would prefer
not to do that, but even more I would like to understand the behavior.

The '->' means that '/bin/sh' is linked to 'dash' (the 'l' in 
'lrwxrwxrwx') ... see 'man ln' for more detail.

 I understand the link.  My question is really about the characteristics and
behavior of dash.  On (someone else's particular) Debian system bash is a
newer version and sh links to bash.

The fundamental question is: How can I pass an argument to sourced script in
dash when the script is specified using its fully qualified path?

I did find this for what it is worth ...
"dash is a minimal shell that is primarily meant to meet POSIX bourne 
shell standards (i.e. BSD's /bin/sh)"

Well, first let's see if we are on the same page ... OK?
    I run Mandriva 2008 and ...
    (1) /bin/sh -> bash
    (2) instead of /etc/gdm/PostSession/Default I have 
/etc/X11/gdm/PostSession/Default
    (2.1) I have included the text of /etc/X11/gdm/PostSession/Default 
below for comparison
    (3) if we are anywhere near on the same  page ... could you show me 
what you are trying to do?
... hoping to help

Also keep in mind that openoffice doesn't support opentype (.otf) fonts yet.
As I recall there's some magic you can do with fontforge to convert them to
truetype (.ttf) format.

gdm/PostSession/default by:

http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Blog/lost-in-logout-land-running-scripts-on-login-and-logout-partially-solved-but-interesting-anyway

Method 1: /etc/gdm/PostLogin/Default, /etc/gdm/PreSession/Default, and
/etc/gdm/PostSession/Default

"If you have a shell script that does not require user intervention, you can
run it automatically immediately after Login, immediately before the start
of the Gnome Session (i.e. before the desktop is drawn), and immediately
after your Gnome Session (i.e. after the Desktop closes down), by launching
it from /etc/gdm/PostLogin/Default, /etc/gdm/PreSession/Default, and
/etc/gdm/PostSession/Default respectively. "

I do not understand the function gdmwhich.  I just added a line executing my
script, using the fully qualified path.  The argument of the script, Logoff,
is placed in my log file, since other events get put in that file as well.
 If I source my script rather than executing it, the argument does not get
received by my script.

I am running ubuntu 9.04

This is not a huge problem.  I can create a duplicate of my script which has
Logoff hard-coded into it.  But I would like to understand why dash does not
pass the argument when the script is sourced.

Is there a way for my script to detect that it is sourced rather than
executed?

-Denis

OOo has always supported OTF on Windows and Mac versions. It's just
Linux OOo that has been stuck in the previous millennium on OTF. And
I'm sure I read somewhere that OOo 3.2 on Linux can finally use OTF. I
can't verify that because I am still using 3.1.1 on Fedora 11,
installed from OOo, not the repos. I need to upgrade, but I've been too
busy.

Denis Heidtmann (sorry ... I have been misspelling your name ... sorry)
To be clear ...
First, my system
    does not have any files in the /PostLogin directory
    does have a Default script in each of the PreSession and PostSession 
directories, but no other files are found there
Second, I am not sure the Default files you have are exactly like the 
ones I have

However ... assuming they are similar at least ...

gdmwhich () {} ...
Pre gdmwhich ()  the value of IFS is saved and then set to :
Then the directories in $PATH are searched for a match to COMMAND (which 
is set to $1)
If the COMMAND is found and it is executable (test -x) and if the OUTPUT 
is an empty variable (since OUTPUT= the "x$OUTPUT" should be "x")
    set OUTPUT to be the directory in which COMMAND was found, followed 
by COMMAND (inserting the required /, of course)
Reset IFS to its old value
"echo" or return that value of $OUTPUT

So far so good?

Now ... in both my PreSession and PostSession, the PATH is set to 
include $PATH, /bin, and /usr/bin, although in PostSession /usr/bin is 
listed twice (see above in quoted message)
In my PreSession there is the line ...
       XSETROOT=`gdmwhich xsetroot`
... note that those are the forward single quotes (normally found on the 
'~' key?), which calls the function with the argument xsetroot, setting 
XSETROOT to whatever is returned (echo'd)
    in other words the value of XSETROOT is whatever directory gdmwhich 
() finds xsetroot in, followed by /, followed by xsetroot - in my case 
that would be /usr/bin/xsetroot - your mileage may vary.
That does assume that xsetroot is found, of course, otherwise OUTPUT is 
empty.

Does any of that help, or did I miss something?
Regards
Fred James

I can think of a few tests, but since none of my machines have dash, I 
can't guarantee they will work....

You can write the name of the script into a variable, and compare that 
with the value of '$0'.  If they match, then the script was executed; if 
not, it was sourced:

#!/bin/sh
. $HOME/script1.sh full
. ./script1.sh relative

sh $HOME/script1.sh exec


#! /bin/sh
self=script1.sh
called=`basename $0`

if [ "$self" != "$called" ]; then
         echo "I am sourced: $@"
else
         echo "I am executed: $@"
fi


]$ sh script2.sh
I am sourced: full
I am sourced: relative
I am executed: exec


Your problem sounds like a bug in dash.

Your explanation does indeed help me understand what gdmwhich() does.
Since my script resides in one of my directories not in the $PATH, I chose
to execute it above the setting of IFS to : using its fully qualified path.
 It executes fine, and does what is intended.  However, if I source my
script rather than execute it, the argument does not get passed.  I am
assuming now that this behavior is normal for dash.  My remedies are 1) to
execute my script in PostSession/default, in which case the argument is
passed as expected, or 2) source a special script which has the argument
hard-coded in it.

To decide which remedy to choose I would like to know why the Debian Policy
states that scripts used should be sourced.  If violating that policy would
cause no problem that would be my choice.  That is what I have set up at
present, and I have noticed no problems.  However, lacking the understanding
of the motivation for the Policy, I cannot be certain that a problem will
not arise.

So, in summary, my original question was: Why does the argument not get
passed with a sourced invocation? (answer: normal behavior of dash).  The
question now is: If I execute a script from PostSession/default will I cause
a problem?

Thanks so much for the effort you  have put in toward my education.

Neat!  I will give it a try.  If it works in dash, it will solve my problem
quite neatly.  I do not know if my problem is a dash bug or a feature.

Denis Heidtmann
The short version is ...
	(1) put a non-interactive executable in a directory somewhere in the 
defined PATH - set permission correctly of course
	(2) in the appropriate Default script, somewhere between the gdmwhich 
function and exit (probably closer to exit?), get the full path to that 
executable mentioned in step 1 ... something like this ...
		command_to_execute=`gdmwhich name_of_program_without_path`
	(3) execute that program, such as ...
		command_to_execute
	(3.1) of course the call for "command_to_execute" should be within some 
sort of control structure for any appropriate exception handling, eh?
Does that help?
Regards
Fred James
		

[omissions for brevity]

Denis Heidtmann (sorry ... I have been misspelling your name ... sorry)

[more omissions for brevity]

gdmwhich () {} ...
Pre gdmwhich ()  the value of IFS is saved and then set to :
Then the directories in $PATH are searched for a match to COMMAND (which
is set to $1)
If the COMMAND is found and it is executable (test -x) and if the OUTPUT
is an empty variable (since OUTPUT= the "x$OUTPUT" should be "x")
    set OUTPUT to be the directory in which COMMAND was found, followed
by COMMAND (inserting the required /, of course)
Reset IFS to its old value
"echo" or return that value of $OUTPUT

So far so good?

Now ... in both my PreSession and PostSession, the PATH is set to
include $PATH, /bin, and /usr/bin, although in PostSession /usr/bin is
listed twice (see above in quoted message)
In my PreSession there is the line ...
       XSETROOT=`gdmwhich xsetroot`
... note that those are the forward single quotes (normally found on the
'~' key?), which calls the function with the argument xsetroot, setting
XSETROOT to whatever is returned (echo'd)
    in other words the value of XSETROOT is whatever directory gdmwhich
() finds xsetroot in, followed by /, followed by xsetroot - in my case
that would be /usr/bin/xsetroot - your mileage may vary.
That does assume that xsetroot is found, of course, otherwise OUTPUT is
empty.

Does any of that help, or did I miss something?
Regards
Fred James

While the most straight forward way could be to simply hard code the 
full_path_name_to_your_executable into the appropriate Default 
executable, that would create a maintenance problem with Default, and 
could cause unexpected behavior should your_executable not be found 
there, or fail for some reason (i.e., one would have to add all of the 
appropriate exception handling routines to Default, and then do it all 
over again, including the appropriate testing, every time there was an 
upgrade.

But to add a line or two to Default to (a) get the full path name, and 
then (b) execute your_executable, changes the complexion ... for one 
thing, gdmwhich has a bit of error handling in  that it returns nothing 
(empty string) if it cannot find your_executable, and nothing on a line 
by itself (within a program, in this case Default) doesn't do anything, 
so there isn't a problem.  OK?

Now, suppose we thought ... oh, but there may be some unknown number of 
new executables that might be called within Default (at some time in the 
future?)  Well then we might want to make a text file to contain the 
list of those new executables, and add a routine to Default to browse 
through that list, finding the executables, complete their paths, and 
call them each sequentially.

That much said, perhaps we should turn our attention to "if I source my 
script rather than execute it, the argument does not get passed."  Could 
you please, state what is happening here?  For example:  From withing 
Default you are calling script_1, is that correct?

If that is correct, are you attempting to pass an argument to script_1?

And then, what does script_1 do?  For example:  Does it try to return 
some value to Default?

Any clarification would be most welcome
Regards
Fred James

I realize the simple approach of hard-coding the full path to my script
presents a maintenance problem, but perhaps I am willing to live with that.

My script simply writes the date and time followed by a word of text to a
log file.  The word of text is the argument passed to my script, or if no
argument, the word of text is "UNKNOWN".  If my script is invoked from
Default by being sourced, no argument is received by my script, so the entry
in my log is labeled "UNKNOWN".  I have currently solved this problem by
detecting that the script was sourced, assume it was invoked from Default,
and set the word of text to "Logout".  I can refine this by checking that
Default was the caller; I have not done that yet.

If something goes wrong, for whatever reason, I may lose some data, but that
is a risk I am willing to take.  Only if calling my script throws an error
within Default such that Default  fails to do its intended job am I
concerned.  Since Default does nothing at present, I feel pretty safe.

Denis Heidtmann
Thank you for your reply.  I confess I have not found anything that 
would suggest that the program called must/should be sourced, and I am 
at a loss on that score - sorry.  Your solution is as good as any I may 
suggest - the real reason for possibly following one of the other paths 
mentioned appears when the solution is implemented in something more 
than a personal environment, and something more complex than writing log 
notes.  The other approaches follow from the philosophies of modular, 
small, and simple, that says for example: "Each program should do only 
one thing, and do it well."  You shouldn't experience any problem with 
what you have described.  In adhering to the "small is beautiful" and 
"keep it simple" philosophies, I do think it is important not to 
complicate things unnecessarily - so as you have been doing, always try 
to understand what is going on, and take your best shot from there.  
Good luck.

Time today permits working on this again.

I'm endeavoring to set up a WRT54G ver. 6 as a wireless access point. 
Using my laptop, I have connected its wired Ethernet port to one of the 
4 ports on the back of the WRT54G and logged in to the WRT54G's 
administration page.

On the Setup tab. The first section is for Internet Setup. Here, I have 
chosen to use a Static IP of 192.168.0.250, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0, 
and a gateway of 192.168.0.1, which is the LAN IP address if my Netgear 
router. In the Optional Settings section I have given the WRT54G a 
Router Name of BsmtRtr.

The next section is Network Setup. I've assigned the WRT54G the IP 
address of 192.168.0.251 and have set the Subnet Mask set to 255.255.255.0.

When I try to save those settings I get an error message that says:

The WAN IP address is same with the LAN IP address! Please check them again!

Aren't 192.168.0.250 and 192.168.0.251 different?

Am I missing something fundamental here?

Actually, the WAN subnet and the LAN subnet are the same. You must use
192.168.1.x for the LAN if you're using 192.168.0.x for the WAN, or
vice-versa.

That worked, as far as finishing that part of the setup goes. But, the 
laptop doesn't see the Internet. Wiring is as follows:

Cable from street --> Cable Modem --> Netgear Router --> Switch --> 
WRT54G Router --> Laptop

The laptop can log in to the WRT54G using Firefox, but doesn't see the 
Internet -- trying to load the Google search page produces "Firefox 
can't find the server at www.google.com."

BTW, to restate the ultimate goal, I'm trying to eliminate a cable 
running across the basement floor with the following wiring:


Cable from street --> Cable Modem --> Netgear Router --> Switch --> 
WRT54G Router --> Linksys WET11 Wireless Ethernet Bridge --> ReplayTV DVR

So, I haven't gotten to the wireless part, yet.

Is the last link wired or wireless?

Can you ping the Netgear router? Cable modem? 208.67.216.231 (google)?

If all of the above succeed the problem is with your DNS configuration.

What does the WRT54G configuration page say the WAN IP address is?

I would assume you're using DHCP for that.

I set a static IP address of 192.168.0.250, a subnet mask of 
255.255.255.0, and a gateway of 192.168.0.1.

No. But when I tried changing to that I got an assigned IP from the 
Netgear router of 192.168.0.5. I still can't ping the Netgear router 
through the WRT54G.

Do you observe the network connection for the WRT54G blinking on the
Netgear router when you're trying to ping it?

What should be happening is the 54G uses NAT to translate your laptop
ping source IP to 192.168.0.5 (or .250, whichever is configured),
forwards the ping to the Netgear, which replies back to the 54G, which
un-NATs it back to your laptop IP address and forwards it out to the
laptop.

If the pings causes the Netgear LAN port to blink then it's getting
that far but not coming back, or not all the way back as you can't
visually distinguish whether the blinking means the ping packet
arrived and was replied to or not.

I think this should all Just Work with default settings on the 54G
other than needing a network different from the Netgear LAN, including
DHCP for WAN address. Did you reset it to factory defaults just for
fun?  ;-)

Sorry but I'm out of time for now. Good luck with it.

Dick,
In theory the network setup I would use would be the following.

LAN side Netgear = 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.252
WAN side Linksys = 192.168.0.2 255.255.255.252

That creates a nice little P2P network between the 2 devices with a /30 subnet

then the LAN side Linksys as Neal pointed out needs to be something
different such as 192.168.1.x

One thing that you can do that's even easier that all this
separate-network silliness, since you already have a gateway router
(the netgear), just plug a cat5 from a LAN port on the netgear to a
LAN (not WAN!) port on the linksys, and the wireless network will
bridge onto the netgears LAN network.  You might want/need to turn off
the DHCP server on the linksys, and you might want to give your
linksys a non-conflicting static IP on the netgears LAN network.

Unless you need two separate networks.

Hello plug!

(i seem to've missed the mark on plug-web, so i'm reposting this here.)

i attended my first PLUG meeting, and definitely plan on attending
more. :) at the meeting it was mentioned that there was a desire for
some time now to revamp the pdxlinux.org website. i have experience in web
design and would be happy to contribute some hours to the community doing
a
rework, both in style and correction of dead links or outdated
information.

i've done a mockup of a proposed style based on a
creative-commons-licensed
css template from freecsstemplates.org, which can be previewed at
http://nathanewilliams.com/portfolio/images/mockup.png . i was hoping to
probe interest before committing many hours to the project. any feedback?

also, who are the current maintainers of the pdxlinux.org website so i
know 
who to run this by?

regards,

nathan w

Richard,

I rounded up a WRT54G ver 8 for testing. Resetting the factory
defaults does in fact worked without changing anything as its default
LAN address is 192.168.1.x and my LAN is 192.168.0.x. Also continued
to work Just Fine after upgrading the firmware to the current release
for my hardware version, 8.00.8 build 001.

I wasn't going to bring this up but since Russell mentioned it ...   ;)

Both the LAN address and DHCP disable are in the same place on the
Basic Setup page, but I'm sure you already knew that. This has the
added benefit of possibly eliminating the switch the WRT54G is plugged
into if you only have two other devices in that location.

Speaking of complicated, the two network scenario assumes you don't
want to access the ReplayTV DVR from the WRT54G network side of
things. If you do that would require setting up a static route in the
WRT54G. This is under Advanced Routing. Assigning a static IP to the
ReplayTV DVR would make things easier, although a reserved DHCP
assignment may suffice and allows doing all the fixed IP address
assignments for your LAN in one place. I've had varying luck with
different DHCP servers and clients over the years so it may or may not
work (reliably), especially with the wireless link in the path.

Not sure if this should have been directed to off topic so feel free
to redirect if that's where it needs to go.

I have a large data set that is being exported from an Oracle DB,
unfortunately I can't work with the data directly in Oracle or this
wouldn't be a problem. I can export it as CSV and work with it. I've
imported to MySQL and Postgres is an option as well. That said, I'm
looking for a way to extract the frequency of words in a given column
and then present a sorted list. I've found a few ideas relating to
stored procedures but MySQL doesn't support it in such a way that it's
applicable to what I want to do. I don't really care which language I
do it in and whether I do it directly from csv or a database source
other than Oracle (because I can't).

Any clue sticks, ideas or links to something that might help me solve
this problem appreciated.

With apologies to Randal...

Assume you export to CSV and, for the purposes of this simple example there
are no text fields that have commas embedded.

And if the data of interest is in the third column:

  3,14,word,blah,blech,bz
  4,18,term,more,stuff

then:

  perl -ne '@F=split /,/; $words{$F[2]}++; \
    END{ foreach $word (sort { $words{$a} <=> $words{$b} } keys %words) \
    { print "$word\t$word_appearance{$word}\n"; } } ' file_of_data.cvs

Assuming you want it sorted by word frequency.

Disclaimer:  I'm at my in-laws for easter dinner and didn't test that.
I'm reasonably sure that it's close enough that any gaps will serve
as an exercise for the reader.

Thanks Rich and Michael. I'll give the perl a shot and see what
happens. As far as the data layout. It's 5 columns with roughly 1100
rows, the column I'm interested in has a variable number of words per
entry but doesn't exceed a couple hundred words.

I did enable fulltext searching within mysql which works fine for
searching but doesn't give me the flexibility I'm looking for to
actually just get a count of unique words. I did find something in PHP
that is supposed to work but it's barfing on the array that's being
returned by the mysql query.

If you want a routine that will correctly parse a line from a CSV file
into a list of individual fields, try the following. You will have to
translate it into your language du jour (this is Common Lisp). It
correctly handles quoted fields that contain commas within the text.

ppcre is a library for regular expressions. If you use perl, you can
easily use the native regex support. All I'm doing there is replacing
newline with nothing. (Maybe chomp() is sufficient?) Remember that
this function handles a single line of input. If there is a newline in
there, it's because the file came from a Windows machine. You'll see
^M at the end of the line in Emacs.

(defun parse-csv-line (line)
   "Parses a single line of CSV input into a list of string fields."
   (let ((quoted-string-mode nil)
         (line-list ())
         (field-collector ""))
     (loop for this-char across (ppcre:regex-replace-all #\Return line "") do
          (cond ((equal this-char #\")
                 (setf quoted-string-mode (not quoted-string-mode)))
                ((and (equal this-char #\,) (not quoted-string-mode))
                 (push field-collector line-list)
                 (setf field-collector ""))
                (t
                 (setf field-collector (format nil "~a~a" field-collector this-char)))))
     ;; get the field after the last comma
     (push field-collector line-list)
     (nreverse line-list)))

This function is just a piece of a complete CSV reading and parsing
solution. You'll need to open a file, read in a line at a time, and
hand the entire line as one long string to this function. All that is
easy to do in perl; that's what perl is made for. It might look like
this:

open(FILEHANDLE, "<somefile.csv") || die("Could not open somefile.csv for reading: $!");
while(my $line = <FILEHANDLE>) {
     chomp($line);
     my @lineList = &parseCsv($line);
     [ do stuff with @lineList ]
}

So you extract 1100, 5 column records into a cvs file?  I take it you have that part down pat?
OK, so is there something special going on, or could a spreadsheet handle your task?  For example: is this a quick, once and done task?
Regards
Fred James

PS: OOo spreadsheets will open cvs files either as comma separated, tab separated (etc), or as fix length fields

Fred,
It's a monthly task that I'll be working with. The number of rows are
variable but the columns are static, definitely have this down pat in
terms of the export from Oracle. I have yet to find a routine within a
speadsheet that gives me the desired results but I'm open to any and
all suggestions. I've been working for a few days on this to try and
find a reasonable and repeatable solution I can use for this task.

Ah, so you'll need to parse that bit too.

Since you're interested in a word count do you need the rest of the row 
data?  If not, why not just export the column of interest?

Assuming that you want the rest of it, save yourself headaches and visit CPAN.org
for Pase::CSV  http://search.cpan.org/~adamk/Parse-CSV-1.00/lib/Parse/CSV.pm

So something like this may help:

#!/usr/bin/perl

while(<>) {
# simplistic, since the fields may also have commas
# use Parse::CSV for real life stuff
    @db_csv_fields = split /,/;

# from problem description the data of interest in in the 3rd field
# and, ahem, we consider a "word" any character sequence that is not whitespace
    @words = split /\s+/, $db_csv_fields[2];
    foreach $w (@words) {
        $word_count{$w}++;
    }
}

# assuming you want the results sorted ascending by frequency
foreach $word ( sort { $word_count{$a} <=> $word_count{$b} } keys %word_count) {
    print "$word\t$word_count{$word}\n";
}

The maintainer of the hardware is Wil Cooley, who is only a few clicks 
away from the "hosted by" link at the bottom of the pages.  I suspect 
that David might be manually changing the "next meeting" portion of the 
page.

   I've not done this before, but others here have so I know there's a lot of
expertise here.

   My niece is visiting up here and wants to connect remotely to the work
server. Their IT folks tell the users that only a host running Microsoft can
connect to their Web server, so she brought her work machine up here with
her.

   What do I need to do to the local network other than attaching a cat5
cable from her machine to the firewall/bridge/switch? This will be a
one-time connection, but I suspect that makes no difference. Do I add her as
a user and assign her machine a static IP address (like the other nodes on
the network)?

   We'll also try having her use my workstation with Opera and see if that
works for her.

TIA,

Rich

   Issue resolved. Turns out that nothing is required, but their server
didn't like an ethernet connection so she's using the wireless access point
here without any issues at all. Go figure.

   Opera on my workstation apparently reports itself as IE-5.5, and their
server wants 6.0 or greater. I'll go find where to make that change.

Message-ID: <l2z5a679c1c1004061519q1d039effw3a106e0880d18723@mail.gmail.com>

I have a "new" machine from FreeGeek that is running Slackware 13.0.
I would like to burn a data CD-ROM, so I installed a package called
"kb3."  When I run "kb3" it complains that it cannot find any burner
hardware.  Looking inside the box, I see I have a Samsung SM-348 with
CD-RW/DVD.

I am able to read from the device.

Should I be able to write CD-ROMS with the device?

------------------------------------
When I run "k3b" as root, I get:

                  <unknown program name>(4164)/: KUniqueApplication:
Cannot find the D-Bus session server

                  <unknown program name>(4163)/: KUniqueApplication:
Pipe closed unexpectedly.

When I run "k3b" as non-root,  a GUI starts but a message comes up
saying it can't find s CR-Rom  writer.

Diagnostics I have tried (I don't know much about hardware):

   1) I grepped dmesg  for SAMSUNG using:

                 dmesg | grep -i SAM

        This gives only:
                           hda: SAMSUNG SP1614N, ATA DISK drive

        which I think is my hard-drive and not the CD_ROM.  (I can
read CDs though?)

    2)  I ran "cdrecord -scanbus"  which gives:

Will the XP boxes be authenticating against Samba -- or merely using 
resources exported by Samba? If the latter, how is authentication 
being done?

It's normal for optical disc drives to show up as ATA, so what ur seeing in dmesg is almost certainly the optical drive. 

Normal mount-point for these types of drives is /dev/sr0, is that present on ur system? And can the OS read from the drive?

Subject: [PLUG] CD-ROM burner.

I have a "new" machine from FreeGeek that is running Slackware 13.0.
I would like to burn a data CD-ROM, so I installed a package called
"kb3."  When I run "kb3" it complains that it cannot find any burner
hardware.  Looking inside the box, I see I have a Samsung SM-348 with
CD-RW/DVD.

I am able to read from the device.

Should I be able to write CD-ROMS with the device?

------------------------------------
When I run "k3b" as root, I get:

                  <unknown program name>(4164)/: KUniqueApplication:
Cannot find the D-Bus session server

                  <unknown program name>(4163)/: KUniqueApplication:
Pipe closed unexpectedly.

When I run "k3b" as non-root,  a GUI starts but a message comes up
saying it can't find s CR-Rom  writer.

Diagnostics I have tried (I don't know much about hardware):

   1) I grepped dmesg  for SAMSUNG using:

                 dmesg | grep -i SAM

        This gives only:
                           hda: SAMSUNG SP1614N, ATA DISK drive

        which I think is my hard-drive and not the CD_ROM.  (I can
read CDs though?)

    2)  I ran "cdrecord -scanbus"  which gives:

It's possible that the drive doesn't include the brand name in its 
output, so grepping for SAM wouldn't work. Try grepping instead for 
scsi,  sr or CD-ROM. Try also:

 lshal | grep -A 10 cdrom
 sudo lshw | grep -A 10 cdrom

Yes, that is your primary hard drive. If your CDROM drive in on the same 
IDE cable as your hard disk, I would expect the drive to show up in the 
traditional Linux location for IDE disks of /dev/hdb. If it is on the 
secondary IDE cable, look for /dev/hdc.

Is this the original CDROM device that was on the machine when it first 
booted after operating system installation? Or did you replace a drive? 
If you replaced a drive, you may have to delete 
/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistant-cd.rules, reboot, and let the udev **** 
(civil?) find the new drive.

Was there a USB "card reader" for a camera SD memeory card plugged in at 
the time you ran

"cdrecord -scanbus"

Authenticating against Samba.  This is a small office, I did this once
upon a time for w2k.  Most reference materials I find spends most of
its time saying how to configure Samba, but seems to assume people know
how to configure Windows clients.  I don't.

REALLY old, but the windows bits are still accurate.

Don't let them "upgrade" to windows 7, as it creates a whole new world of
pain for samba admins.

Do you have write permissions on the CD drive's device node? A long
listing of the device node would be helpful:

  $ ls -lFh /dev/cd*
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 Apr  3 11:45 /dev/cdrom -> hdc
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 Apr  3 11:45 /dev/cdrw -> hdc

Those are just symlinks, and you need to see the permissions set on
the actual device node:

  $ ll /dev/hdc
  brw-rw----+ 1 root cdrom 22, 0 Apr  3 11:45 /dev/hdc

On my system, I need to belong to the 'cdrom' group in order to even
read from the drive (let alone write). And I do:

  $ groups | grep -io cdrom
  cdrom

I'd be surprised if your distribution doesn't work similarly. If you
don't belong to the 'cdrom' group, you can add yourself via the
'adduser' command:

  # adduser yourusernamehere cdrom
  Adding user `yourusernamehere' to group `cdrom' ...
  Adding user yourusernamehere to group cdrom
  Done.

You'll need to log out and log back in (or restart your desktop
session) for the changes to take effect.

Hello,

I'm trying to find someplace in Portland where I can buy a special USB 
cable. Rather than the usual A to B cable, I need a Mini-A to USB A 
female adapter for an embedded system.

I will try Free Geek, but as they deal largely in mainstream computer 
parts, and I doubt they will have it. Radio Shack and the big box 
electronic stores definitely don't have it.

Thanks, and I apologize for the off-topic nature of this post.

there is a plug-talk list for non-linux-specific type chatter.

however, as a proud Part Of The Problem, I will respond in the main group
and let you take it to the correct forum next time.

I don't know for sure where you can find the specific cable you are looking
for. The interweb helped me to arrive here:

http://www.topmicrousa.com/cc2217-06.html

Free Geek has a whole shelf in their store dedicated to USB cables. there is
one section of it just for "etc" - anything that doesn't fit into one of the
major categories. I dug through the whole thing one day and found some very
weird stuff, including some things I was very surprised to learn existed at
all. I do not recall seeing one that matched your description, but that
doesn't mean much.

Try pchcables.com.  They are out near the hillsboro airport, but if
you can wait a day, UPS ground is a not-so-expensive option too.

My problem with my CD_ROM burner has been solved.  Thanks for all
suggestions.  Wayne Van Loon eventually deduced that I had a loose
ribbon cable!  Once it was securely plugged in everything worked as
expected.

   This from the jpilot mail list's thread on what to do when there're no
more PDA/phones running PalmOS.

   Too pricy for me, and my Treo 700p is doing just fine (and I bought a
spare for $27) so I'm not in the market for a new phone. Perhaps this will
be of interest to several of you.

My daughter just bought one from Amazon - $520 -(she is such a geek! I'm so
proud - really) looked at it yesterday. [I told her it was nice and I wished
I could afford one too! (She works for minimum wage!!! (Hope she figures it
out soon))] .. Anyway - needed to open up the wifi to allow the mac-address
- it was nice to see it has an xterm and I could just ifconfig and could
browse /proc etc .. tab complete the whole deal.

It is just the same size as a Treo680 - I wish it was a little bigger with a
bit more screen - but the screen has twice the res as an I-phone and is
really nice.  You could get this phone without a data-plan and be quite
happy - as long as there is wifi about.  I suppose with a skype account you
could skip the phone service as well... I've not messed with skype - wonder
if it would work well enough? If skype can take messages? I wonder if the
cost of a skype plan vs a cell phone plan would pay for the phone over a
year?

The big deal with the Iphone is the two finger pinch - which is nice- I like
it, but not at the expense of poor accuracy. The N900 comes with a stylus! 
(hope someone comes out with a built in ball-point pen like I have for my
Treo) - so you can really navigate menus and work with more data on the
screen. To zoom, you can draw a clockwise circle - counterclockwise to
back-out.  The keyboard is small and nice - a VAST improvement on
I-kludge-screen-keyboards (I've got big fingers - totally frustrating trying
to enter data on these). (I still miss graffiti).

Simple plug in of the USB cable to my Debian box and the internal memory of the 
phone mounts just fine. Moved some pictures over for her. (It has a very nice 
5Mpix auto focus camera with LED flash, gravity sensor)

She went on line and updated - apt-get runs in the background. This is not a 
jail-house-lockup-to-the-point-you-feel-it-belongs-to-your-provider - it is a 
real Linux box and it belongs to the owner! Most of your favorite configs 
should just copy over.

There are bugs here and there - and people that are fixing them ... 
http://blog.rburchell.com/2010/04/qt-on-maemo-warning.html

.. Just like Linux - except with some fancy desktop work.

Nokia is dropping the  Maemo - joining with Intel - the new one called
MeeGo.  It is being developed on the N900. The little I know about the MeeGo
is it sadly will use RPMs - They are promising it will be totally open - I
think Moblin + Maemo = Meego.
http://meego.com/community/blogs/imad/2010/day-1-here-opening-meego-development

People also run pure Debian on the N900 - so a quatro boot phone - Maemo,
Debian, Meego, Android are out there.

I REALLY want one... have to finish a design and really hope business comes
back a bit before I get one. IMHO this is the phone for Linux folks - the
price will drop with time.

Message-ID: <876BA2204DEBC74EA0A0F57DB9F51E6F3E01D04C20@EX-EAST.tellabs-west.tellabsinc.net>

Hi !

I was looking at virtual address space of a process inside kernel space. I could see heap section and mmap section. Fragmentation and defragmentation problem against the memory allocated from heap section is handled by language runtime (glibc) and that's where most of memory management algorithms do work. 

I can see following declarations in struct mm_struct:

unsigned long start_brk, brk,

unsigned long mmap_base;

According to these declarations heap segment has start and end pointers but for mmap segment only base pointer is present  but no end. Then how one would know the total memory consumed by mmap segment. 

Also how fragmentation problem in mmap segment is handled??

Aman

Subject: [PLUG] Trying to nfsroot boot...
Message-ID: <1270809501.3705.8.camel@localhost>

How do I troubleshoot error initializing inotify and used greatest stack
depth boot time messages?  I've modified a boot time mount script that
initializes mtab to nfs mount /usr and /home and I've figured out that
I have to copy libwrap from /usr/lib down to /lib for portmap.
Is there a way to put libwrap on the root filesystem in a place other
than /lib considering that I will want to use the /usr/lib copy once
/usr is mounted?

I am taking a copy of my Linux from scratch system and modifying the
init scripts and fstab for nfsroot.  So far I get to udev-retry
and hang.

I wish people who build LFS systems by the book could get boot scripts
that are smart enough to detect NFS root booting and adjust accordingly.

I can't seem to find a good guide or HOWTO on how to write boot scripts
for NFS root style systems.

Have you tried asking on the diy-linux mailing list.  They seem to be
more responsive to questions
than the LFS group.

Is ldconfig been run on this root directory.  When libraries are
installed or removed, this
program needs to be run.  You can run that during you init process if
you can get that far
during the boot or chroot into the directory on the server and run it there.

I've been using Ubuntu 10.04 beta 1 and it's been running very good. Even
did a
sudo apt-get -u upgrade and it went very smooth, even fixed the bugs from
beta 1. Will reinstall with final version April 29.

Ubuntu going astray 

Getting rid of Gnome's custom login screen and sound customizing apps?
Why? They seem like basic features of an OS trying to attract desktop
users from the Windows world. Why get rid of them? 

Or change the min/min/close/max button style to that new wacky model?
Yes, with a little Linux knowledge the user can change back to the old
button style and customize their own sound theme but it sure won't
attract any new users from the Windows world who are Linux neophytes. 

And wassup with Grub2 replacing the old Grub? Who but some dedicated
Linux geek programmer  would see any use for Grub2's features? Or
plymouth?  Wouldn't the Ubuntu team have been smarter to employ a grub
w/gfxboot like Mepis?

Maybe Shuttleworth and his programmers are more interested in showing
what they can do than showing they care about what real-world desktop
users are looking for.  Kudos to Shuttleworth for providing a user
friendly Linux desktop for the masses, Hardy and Jaunty. Too bad he's
losing sight of that worthy goal in pursuit of God knows what.

The "old Grub" is now "GRUB Legacy" and is no longer being developed. 
Without passing judgment on the wisdom of abandoning grub 0.9x, I'll 
say that distros will sooner or later have to (a) go to GRUB 2 or (b) 
start to maintain the legacy code themselves.

I suspect that, in the longer term, going with decision (a) is a 
no-brainer.

Here is a little different slant on that.
I don't care to attract a bunch of Windows users. For a lot of computer 
users to use Linux, it would have to be dumbed down to gui use only and 
applications reduced to something even smaller than Ubuntu.

Message-ID: <86k4sgcuq0.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


Big story on the front of today's Metro section includes a familiar
name and a familiar face.  Honestly, I didn't notice the last name
until I'd read through the story and saw the name "Galen" halfway down
the third column, then backed up and the "Seitz" connection started to
sink in.  And then I saw the face in the picture.

I guess getting the O isn't completely the dead loss I thought it was.

Hi

I'm on the Free Geek Grant group.  One group wants to be able to stop the
access to porn on their grant computers.  Any suggestions?

Debra





True reconciliation is never cheap, for it is based on forgiveness, which
is costly. Forgiveness in turn depends on repentance, which has to be
based on an acknowledgment of what was done wrong, and therefore on
disclosure of the truth. You cannot forgive what you do not know.

One way is to use a service such as OpenDNS:

http://www.opendns.com/solutions/household/

For Firefox there is FoxFilter:

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4351

Most sophisticated filter can be done with Dans Guardian:

http://dansguardian.org/

Good luck and let us know what works for you.

I would consider not donating to Free Geek if they are going to use my
donations to impose their morals on other people.

FWIW, i read the original message as saying that the recipient of grant
machines wished to block porn on the machines they were granted. If
that's indeed the case, then i don't see a problem.

Are you saying Barry that the sexual exploitation of: men, women, and
children to make money is acceptable?  I for one run Dansguardian, but
in realistic terms it makes more sense to have your Internet Service
Provider do the filtering as any locally installed program is going to
be easily bypassed.  Getting addicted to XXX is not a good thing where
any group that wants to limit access to this sort of material certainly
has my support.  Are you willing Barry to replace sex with Internet
porn?  Porn is a poor substitute for real sex between a life long
committed man and a life long committed woman in private.  How do you
feel Barry about people who are supposed to abstain from sex when it
comes to porn?  That includes religious people and anyone who is single.
I wonder what values you honestly have Barry if you think there is
nothing negative about porn?  Studies show that pornography negatively
affects married couples too.

XXX is just one thing I would welcome ISP level filtering for.  Online
gambling also bothers me, ebay being an exception.  It should be obvious
that material on the web that could fuel sexual harassment lawsuits
and/or unduly impact productivity is going to raise legitimate concerns.

Why aren't web sites rated the way movies are?  Surely, ISPs can offer
filtering based on third party ratings of web sites?  One isn't talking
about censorship if ISP level filtering is a voluntary low cost service
and employers should have a right to impose certain browsing
restrictions on employees.

What right do you have Barry to impose your porn is a good thing
attitude on everyone else?

I find it sad that a woman points out a problem and no man yet has stood
up to support her.

I'd say that keeping pr0n off a computer is a really good step in
keeping viruses off the computer.

Sorry I can't support Debra further with instructions as I haven't any.

If that was the original meaning of the post then I apologize. The
grantee can do whatever they want with their own computers. In that
case OpenDNS is a good suggestion.

I agree with most of what Michael Robinson says. Barry, in many cases, I
think it is the exact opposite of what you say. Porn filtering sites are
there to prevent porn merchants from imposing their morals on those who are
trying to avoid it. I can say from experience that it is highly addictive
and that it does negatively impact committed relationships.

I understood your request but it took several readings.

It would have been clearer by substituting "from" for "on".

Now for an answer. Dansguardian <http://dansguardian.org/> will do the

WT_?

"One group wants to be able to stop the access to porn on their grant computers."

That is a simple declarative sentence.  
One only needs to retain four phrases in their short term memory to grok it.

OK, not as simple as Hemingway.  Simplier than Stephanson, Dick, Carroll or LeGuin.

May the linguists among us flame me if I'm wrong.

It is an ambiguous sentence. It could be read to mean blocking access
to porn that is *already* on those computers, either from people on
the computer, or from the outside world, as well as what he likely
meant, blocking people using those computers from accessing porn sites
out there on the internet.

I would like a lot of windows users to discover Linux, and Ubuntu does as
good a job as any to do that.

Ubuntu, Mint and Mandriva are the distros that will get more people to use
Linux and that's a good thing no matter what all you narrow minded dweebs
think!

My $0.02 here.

The confusion, from my perspective at least, was this-
Is the OP asking for help setting up filtering on computers that they or
their group owns, that they received from Free Geek,
or are they asking about setting up filters on ALL computers given out by
Free Geek, regardless of whether the recipient wants such filters in place?


This is where the individual rights issue comes up, whether Free Geek has
the right to set up filters on all the computers it gives out.

This is (or at least should be) separate from the moral issue of XXX on the
internet, but the issue of the rights of the donor (Free Geek) and the
rights of the recipient of the donated computers, to control what kinds of
materials can be accessed on said computers, once the donor takes the
computers to their private home.

This is, and should be, separate from the right of, say, an employer to
control access to certain materials on the employer's computers at the
employer's place of business, using the employer's internet connection.
This type of TOS restriction is common in most workplaces. (Or also
employee's computers while accessing the employer's internet connection,
etc)

The OP mentioned being on the Free Geek Grant Group, and since I am not
involved with Free Geek I don't know what kind of control they exercise over
the computers being given out to individuals and groups, so thus the
confusion.

In other words, if this is about computers that an individual or group owns,
received from Free Geek but no longer under their control, then they should
be able to setup any kind of filtering they want for their private use.
However if this is about controlling the access to any kind of material on
all Free Geek computers after they leave Free Geek, and go into other
people's private homes, that then crosses the line into censorship by one
group over another, IMHO.  The individual (or group) owner of the computer
should decide for themselves if they want to filter content, not someone
else.

Is that clear as mud now? ;)

It's been said that they were the greatest generation, and I have to 
agree. They fought and won WWII, the largest conflict ever in the 
history of this planet, then promptly rebuilt their former foes. They 
built ENIAC, the interstate highway system, defeated polio, outlawed 
segregation, and went to the moon - to name but just a few examples.

I'm sorry that my language was not as precise as some would like.  I
really did not intend to upset so many people.

The group who received computers from Free Geek has people from age 4 to
age 106 who use the computers. The computer area is not closely monitored.
 Most people use the computers respectfully however someone has been using
their computers to go to porn sites and then leaving the site and the
pictures there for the next user of the computer.  This is very disturbing
if you are 4 years old (or any age) and you are not expecting this and do
not want to see it.

If they knew for sure who is doing this, it might be possible to ban
him?her from the community center.

Thank you for the suggestions.

I'll try to post again to let you know how things go.

Peace
DFhubbard

True reconciliation is never cheap, for it is based on forgiveness, which
is costly. Forgiveness in turn depends on repentance, which has to be
based on an acknowledgment of what was done wrong, and therefore on
disclosure of the truth. You cannot forgive what you do not know.

It is not you who owes an apology--it is we who owe more than one to you.
 It would be kind to say the thread was hijacked.  I hope, out of all the
shouting, you gained some ideas in the way of a solution.

I second (third?) using OpenDNS. You can restrict access to porn sites 
that way. I've used it at home, and it works.

I would also suggest a Squid Web caching proxy that you can use along 
with some form of logging daemon to figure out what local machine is 
pulling down the objectionable content. They did this at one of my 
previous employers. Unfortunately, I don't know the specifics as to what 
was involved.

This is even enforceable at the network level - block all traffic on port 53
to any place except the openDNS servers.

If the offending content is left open for the next person to see, you can
just view the browser history on that machine and see where else they went.
there may be clues there.

Just had a thought. Maybe review that browsing history, erase it. 
Install Swatch on a laptop, use the information from said history to 
alert you when someone is attempting to access those sites. Then give 
them a good private talking to about acceptable use.

Perhaps, even, the only talk that needs to be given is "clean up the
shared space when you are finished."

Well, I don't know anything about OpenDNS.  I do know something about
Dansguardian though which can be somewhat effective.  The problem with
Dansguardian that I run into is that downloading isn't allowed where
some things like movies for example can be difficult to filter and
effectively, someone watching a movie can get around what Dansguardian
is trying to filter out.  Programming a computer to determine what is 
in a picture and whether or not it is appropriate for the viewer, very
difficult problem.  

I'm looking at OpenDNS right now, but I'm a little unhappy already.
They don't let you look at the white papers without identifying
yourself, which I consider a privacy issue.  I should be able to look at
what the service is and how it is implemented without announcing to the
world that I'm doing so.

What I am looking for is a service that rates web content using the 
most accurate method possible, have actual people look at it.  The 
most important thing with any rating system is accuracy.  The system
should be confidential too.  Apparently, OpenDNS is not confidential.
I'm sure that cloud computing is powerful, but a computer cannot
classify web content better than a mature adult human being can.

May I suggest that public computers be programmed to auto dump and auto
log out so that the next person is less likely to run into what the last
person was looking at?  This isn't a way to solve the problem, but this
should help.

Look at Dansguardian if you can.  Using what Dansguardian thinks is
appropriate as a basis is not a bad idea.  Another thing, can you
have a group of people that are older rate the sites being browsed?

Some porn sites are probably illegal, especially ones depicting 
incest and children.  The police should probably talk to the person
who viewed such sites.

Something like OpenDns is interesting, the problem I have though 
is one of privacy.  If I have a problem, the last thing I want to 
do is announce this to the world.  The solution is to filter at the
Internet service provider level, but how do you protect the privacy 
of your patrons if you do this?  The Internet Service Provider, not
individuals, should be asking for the filtered DNS service.

I question whether a person who views porno simply needs a talking to.
Realize that porno is addictive.  If you can get an addict to get help,
that is better than just saying a few words to him/her about acceptable
use.  Filtering porno out is good, but in the end one has to train and
discipline himself to stay away out of respect for himself and the human
race in general.  Too many people are indulging in the "adult"
entertainment industry or there wouldn't be one.  Wherever there is
porn, there is a push for money.  If someone pays for illegal content
through your public facility, there is a real problem that exists
regardless of what you feel is and is not appropriate.

One concern I have, take good care of yourself.  If I had the job of
keeping people out of porn sites and other addictive/illegal sites on
the Web, I know that I'd want someone checking in on me from time to
time.  Being a woman, I suspect that porn sites are less of a problem
for you than they tend to be for a man.  Still, remember to take care 
of yourself as you work to provide a safe environment for the community.

God bless and good luck.

Subject: [PLUG] CentOS 5.x/Fedora 12, Connect to Server, OOo read-only files
Message-ID: <4BC4BA71.5020200@cyber-office.net>

I'm trying to move a bunch of files off my desktop on to a server and 
still be able to access them from my rover (eeePC 100 running Fedora 12) 
and the workstation (CentOS 5).

I have two issues with this setup.  One _rather_ important (files open 
in OOo as read-only) and the other an irritation (Fedora insists on 
labeling the icon on the desktop with *everything* about the mount.)

So first problem.  When I do a Menu -> Connect to Server and fill in all 
the important information: Service type:SSH, Server: host.example.com, 
Folder: /home/user, Name to use for the connection: user at host I get 
connection and I've copy/cut and pasted to the mount point, dragged and 
dropped to it and subdirectories with no problems.  But ... when I open 
one of the files with OOo (Calc) it opens as read-only.  Permissions are 
fine.  The only hick-up is the owner and group IDs that show in File 
Browser window are those on the server which is not what I have on the 
workstation or rover.  But if I edit a text file with gedit I can.

OOPS I forgot.  The shell on the remote system is rssh not bash but this 
is not a chroot/jail setup.  I suppose I'll try with bash in case there 
is an environment (~/.bashrc,~/.bash_profile) problem.

Any thoughts ideas on what is going on?


The second "irritation" I have some more testing to do.  I think I found 
the solution the other day.  Just not enough TUITs.

I realize is probably going overboard but it's my favored set up that
I've been using for about 6 years which is to use LDAP which resolves
the UID/GID problems. I haven't played with the remote mounting stuff
in Fedora yet but I'm doing an install on my laptop tonight so I can
see if I have the same problem with shared files showing up read only
if that's of any use.

OOo files are compressed collections of several files, aren't they? I 
wonder if the problem is that you're not working on that file 
directly, but on its contents.

That would jibe with being able to do straight text editing with gedit 
while being unable to use Calc files.

Sure all these things are choices but what about when they affect everyone
else in the work environment?  For example if everyone at the company is
allowed to access porn but by allowing this all the company's bandwidth is
saturated and nobody can get any work done.

I'll look at LDAP.

Looking forward to your F12 experience.  Note Paul's reference to the 
OOo stuff being compressed and causing the problem.

Hum.  Interesting thought.  I'm going to toss a Excel spreadsheet up 
there and see if OOo still has an issue.

There was a message from gedit when saving but I was not able to catch 
it at all.  Appeared and gone it far less than a second.

Do you think there would be the same problems if I set up a WebDAV?  I 
seem to remember OOo accepting a URL/URI for a document name.  Hum. 
Time to do more research.

Indeed they are compressed files .. found via el goog

"As you can see, the editing interface is much like that of any other
WYSIWYG word processor screen (the OpenOffice user interface is beyond
the scope of this article). I saved the file as document.sxw. As with
all files saved in OpenOffice native format, this is actually a ZIP
file that contains a set of XML and other support files -- a bundling
known as the OpenOffice package format. "

But shouldn't permission inheritance be in play if this is the case?

I've never used the GUI tools to which you refer, but the SSH-based 
connection you're getting probably doesn't have anything resembling 
real filesystem semantics.

It's more like FTP: you can pipe any single file over the connection, 
edit it, and ship it back. Beyond that, however, it doesn't have the 
moxie to allow an application to create and manipulate multiple 
filehandles on the remote mount point.

I don't use OpenOffice.org, so I don't really know all that much about 
its requirements, but if it wants a real filesystem, use NFS or CIFS. 
You can use either one over an OpenVPN tunnel, although you'll 
probably be somewhat bothered by the latency (if not the bandwidth).

Not that it means much, but I have had the opposite experience. I use SSHFS
frequently and it works wonderfully for all the things you describe. The
main file-system feature it's missing is viewing the free space on the
remote machine. My only real gripe is that it doesn't auto-reconnect after a
disconnection.

This is what I've used before.  The problem is it is not very user 
friendly GUI-wise (Gnome.)  I'd have thought the Connect to server would 
offer sshfs as an option.  Well I was wishful thinking the ssh option 
was what I was getting.  But I have to say silly me: the Fedora displays 
the connection as sftp and rssh doesn't appear to support sshfs as an 
option.

Darn.  Back to the drawing board.

Any one know what package or subsystem the "Places" and "Connect to 
server" code are members of?

I think some got confused about publicly accessible computers vs computers that are personal. 

While I have no problem with porn, I also know that some porn sites are sources of much computer contamination. For that reason alone, I would filter access to many sites to keep the publicly accessible systems healthy. 

If there's a legitimate reason to go to a blocked site, then that user can ask.

Thanks.

I found this a little bit ago as I was searching.  CentOS uses GnomeVFS 
(deprecated), Fedora 12 uses GVFS but neither does sshfs.  Damn!

I also found a sshfs implementation for Windows so all my bases could be 
covered using sshfs.  It would be nice to get sshfs into GVFS and 
GnomeVFS.  Make the process a little slicker.

I would love to see that, but I will be making presentations in the
bay area at that time.  Projector Wallah gone AWOL.  So now would
be a good time to look for an alternative projector for April 21.

Hi Scott,

Sure, SA may be set up on a separate server without too much
trouble--you might even consider a "jailed" environment in BSD, a fully
virtualized server with Xen, or perhaps a "chrooted" environment.

If by "cards" you are referring to ethernet devices, you needn't have
two, you may simply create an alias to an existing network device:

Subject: [PLUG] Rack computer cases locally
Message-ID: <4BC64110.4010902@emediatedesigns.com>

All,

I'm looking for a 3U case that holds an ATX board and is not that deep.  
I have found some online but was hoping for a shop in town that carries 
such cases.  I want to convert my standard mid-tower to a rack mount 
case so I may mount it in a portable case.  I take it about for some 
live production.

Just looking for a local shop to support.

Thanks,

Josh

I know Fry's isn't 'local' in this sense, but they do carry rack cases.

Most of my rack mount cases have been purchased from 
http://www.servercase.com. Very wide range of cases from 1U to 8U.

Does anyone have any good recommendations for PATA based SSD drives for an
older Gateway laptop that does not support SATA, that has no issues running
Ubuntu or Debian?  32-64GB is acceptable for capacity.

I've looked at Fry's before and never found any that work.  The website 
you suggested did have some good options thanks.

Too bad there appears to not be a local shop carrying these cases. 
Maybe a media center case has mount brackets?

ENU has several ATA100 IDE drives starting at $53 for 160 GB:

Not sure who might have it locally. I used to use pricewatch.com for 
drives and memory. Lately, google has been better for pricing. Of 
course, this assumes that mail order is acceptable.

If you are looking for recommendation on brand or model, sorry. I have 
not taken the plunge.

I have version 1.1.1 of the Dirk Dashing demo and I am trying to run the

change any of the options in the option menu crashes the demo.  Does
anyone know what is different between CentOS 5.4 and Fedora 12 that is
relevant to this problem?  I am trying to work with Troy on this
problem, but I wonder if anyone else already knows a workaround.

Subject: [PLUG] What's the Dot in the Access Modes Column Mean?
Message-ID: <4BCB34C6.5000002@gisnet.com>

Hi folks,

I've got a Red Hat Fedora core 11 system that has a relatively new 
feature that I don't recognize and my Google-fu doesn't seem to be 
strong enough this morning to find the answer to this question.

When I run ls -al I get  a listing like the following. But notice the 
dot on the right of the access modes for nearly all the files. It's 
there on all except MapBook.zip. Can someone tell me what this dot 
indicates and why it doesn't appear with MapBook.zip?

Subject: [PLUG] Configuring a Linksys WET11
Message-ID: <4BCBAFFA.5000608@comcast.net>

At the clinic this afternoon, Wes helped me regain access to my WRT54G 
and how to think about configuring it. (Thanks, Wes!) We also found the 
IP address of my WET11. Alas, I am again unable to browse to the WET11's 
admin page. I didn't take enough notes this afternoon to be able to 
duplicate the way we discovered the IP address associated with the 
WET11's mac address. I DID write down the IP address we discovered, 
192.168.1.225, and the one we changed it to, 192.168.0.250, but I was 
unable to browse to either when having only an Ethernet connection 
between the computer and the WET11. I've also tried resetting the WET11 
and using the default IP address, 192.168.1.225.

I tried running arp on this on this machine (the one I'm typing on) and 
can see the IP and mac addresses of my router and one other computer on 
my home network. I tried it with the machine I used at the clinic but I 
only see the IP and mac addresses of my router. When I remove the 
connection to my router, replace it with the WET11, and run arp again, I 
get no output. I gave that machine (the one I used at the clinic) a 
static IP address of 192.168.0.249, but I don't see how that would matter.

Any recommendations on what to try next?

Thanks.

The important point is that the computer you're trying to access it from has
to have an IP address in the same network (192.168.x) as the device you're
trying to access. So if you've reset the WET11, and its IP has reverted to
192.168.1.225, you'll need to set the computer you're trying to access it
from to an IP in the 192.168.1.x range.

nmap -p0 192.168.0.\*
nmap -p0 192.168.1.\*

that will scan each of those IP subnets for active machines and then scan
each of the ports on each of those machines.  It might help you determine
which machines are there.

Message-ID: <20100418184405.71c5a392@mailhost.pdx.edu>

As we were clearing out from the Clinic this afternoon a Dell laptop
power supply was found on the SE corner of the tables. We placed it on
top of the PLUG cabinet. The cabinet is located down the hall to the
west of the Clinic room.

It was there when I got there, so I wonder if it wasn't left by someone
before the clinic.

I don't remember seeing it when I got there, and I was the first one in
the room. Then again, I have no clear recollection of what was on the
table when I walked in the room. 

If none of our attendees respond I'll e-mail someone at Free Geek in
case it belongs to one of their people.

That's the part I didn't write down. I changed the machine to 
192.168.1.249 and was able to connect to the default IP address of the 
WET11. Then, I changed the IP address of the WET11 to 192.168.0.250, 
saved it and closed the browser. I changed the IP address of the machine 
back to 192.168.0.249, ran ifconfig up, and logged back into the WET11.

Thanks, again.

Now, sometime next week, I'll try testing the range of the WRT54G in 
802.11b mode. After that I should be able to satisfy my wife that we're 
about as secure as we need to be out here in the woods. Then I can hook 
up my ReplayTV with this setup and coil up the Ethernet cable laying on 
the family room floor!

Subject: [PLUG] Dumb script question
Message-ID: <20100418195531.17fab377@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I have a desktop computer (Intrepid x86_64) that runs for months and
months and is never rebooted. (All it does is play the radio and and the
occasional movie, and act as a backup in case I seriously goober up my
laptop.) I noticed this afternoon that its time was off by five
minutes. I know that I can reset the time from an NTP server by
rebooting, but that is a pain. Google told me that I can reset the time
with:

ntpdate 0.pool.ntp.org
hwclock --systohc

So I decided to use my amazing knowledge of bash scripting learned at
the recent class to create a little script with an icon next to the
clock display in the Gnome panel. My script is:

#! /bin/bash
su #'cause only root can set the time
ntpdate 0.pool.ntp.org
hwclock --systohc

When I try to run it as jjj it asks for root password, I enter it,
and then I get an authentication error. If I change to root first and
then run it, it runs fine, and without prompting for root password.

It must be the su line. How do I make a script run as root? Or can I
fiddle with the permissions so jjj has permission to set the time, then
just remove the su line from the script and forget about running it as
root?

Have you tried putting the su in front of ntpdate on the same line?

how do you "change to root" ? I'm betting it's with sudo su rather than just
su. When you use sudo, it asks for jjj's password instead of root's.

There are 2 solutions available: change your script to use sudo in front, or
just have the commands run as root automatically on a schedule via cron.

Choices, choices, choices


Change the script to:
    #!/bin/bash
    sudo ntpdate 0.pool.ntp.org
    sudo hwclock --systohc

or

Change the script to:
    #!/bin/bash
    ntpdate 0.pool.ntp.org
    hwclock --systohc
and 
    invoke it by `sudo <script_name>`
or
    su
    crontab -e
    <insert line in crontab to have root run the script once every X> 
    exit
or
    sudo chown root <script_name>
    sudo chmod +x <script_name>
    sudo chmod u+s <script_name>

The last one is what you asked for.

Thanks for the heads up. Of course sudo su uses jjj's password, and I
must have done that, although I could swear I used just su. I say that
I must have done that because just now I tried su and got an
authentication error. I suspect there is no root password set on the
computer. I think Ubuntu does not set a root password by default.

And, after thinking about it, the cron approach sounds simpler. I could
set it to run just once a month, which would be sufficient to keep the
clock reasonably current. 

Off to figure out cron.

True reconciliation is never cheap, for it is based on forgiveness, which
is costly. Forgiveness in turn depends on repentance, which has to be
based on an acknowledgment of what was done wrong, and therefore on
disclosure of the truth. You cannot forgive what you do not know.

That is correct. 
It expects everything to be done via sudo.

The big trick with cron is that it doesn't have a normal env so you
tend to have to use full paths to everything, or manually set the
environment prior to running the command.  It's also tricky debugging
because you don't get to tell it to run now.  You usually have to set
the frequency of how often it runs really low until you figure it out.

After an hour of trying to make sense of cron I gave up. I'm sure it's
an amazing tool that will do wonderful things, but I don't need to do
wonderful things.

I installed gnome-schedule, which appears to be a GUI front end for
cron. Unfortunately, the documentation does not match the application
and there appears to be no way to run a command with it as root or as
superuser.

So I edited my script and put sudo in front of both commands, made a
gnome-panel icon to launch it in a terminal, and it is working fine.
I'll run it whenever I notice the clock doesn't match my watch by
enough to care about.

When you find the time to explore cron Jason it's well worth the time
spent. Maybe we could do a quick hits basics during one of the monthly
meetings if we don't have speakers lined up to go over things like
cron etc.

A useful trick whenever you're invoking executables in an unknown
environment is to simply run env and redirect it to a file.

When I run the cron command setup as
  *  *  *  *  *   env > mycrontab.env
using crontab I get the following in a file named mycrontab.env in my
home directory on a Ubuntu 8.04LTS box:

HOME=/home/neals
LOGNAME=neals
PATH=/usr/bin:/bin
SHELL=/bin/sh
PWD=/home/neals

Not a lot there, eh?

How you hook sudo into all of this is an exercise left to interested
parties.  ;)

Actually, rather than using your script, you should just be able to go
to System -> Administration -> Time&Date and configure your system to
automatically synchronize to Internet time servers.

Alternatively, the cron entry you're looking for is:

0 * * * * /usr/sbin/ntpdate pool.ntp.org

Use "sudo crontab -e" to add this line to root's crontab using your
favorite text editor.  It will sync your clock at the top of every
hour against a random selection of time servers from pool.ntp.org.

Good idea. Unfortunately, I have run into another problem.

Opening System > Administration > Time and Date presents a dialog box
that does not allow me to do anything until I successfully "unlock" it.
There is a button labeled "Unlock," but when I click on it and enter
jjj's superuser password it pops up "Could not authenticate. An
unexpected error has occurred."

Then I decided it was high time to set a root password, so I went into
System > Administration > Users and Groups. Again, the dialog box has
an Unlock button, but attempting to unlock it returns the same error
message.

All of these actions run glacially slow.

Finally I set a root password from the command line with "sudo passwd
root." This appeared to work successfully; that is, I can become root
now with "su" by entering the password that I just set. But I still get
the error messages when I try to "unlock" anything, including the Time
and Date utility.

Note that this is Intrepid x86_64.

It's bedtime. I'll deal with this more when I am awake tomorrow.

You should be running ntpd, not using ntpdate.  ntpdate is just for
gross corrections at bootup.  Using it *after* booting will likely break
things at mysterious times, like make builds.  ntpd knows how to "drift"
the time clock slightly faster or slower so that time never goes
backwards or skips grossly forwards.

All

I was assuming the OP was not running NTPD and was using ntpdate to
set system time

<quote>
ntpdate  can  be run manually as necessary to set the host clock, or it
       can be run from the host startup script to set the clock at boot  time.
       This is useful in some cases to set the clock initially before starting
       the NTP daemon ntpd. It is also possible to run  ntpdate  from  a  cron
       script.  However,  it  is important to note that ntpdate with contrived
       cron scripts is no substitute for the NTP daemon, which uses  sophisti-
       cated  algorithms to maximize accuracy and reliability while minimizing
       resource use. Finally, since ntpdate does not discipline the host clock
       frequency as does ntpd, the accuracy using ntpdate is limited.
</quote>

So I don't see anything wrong with running ntpdate or rdate once a day
if you want..  Given NTPD would be better...  Probably not a critical
issue??

Back in the old days.... I would wait for the noon train to go by and
then set the clocks in the house and the computer at the same..  That
was an example of a  PERFECT system.

YMMV

Marvin

It wants you to enter your own password, just like sudo...

There is a handy little utility called gksudo thats acts as a graphic
wrapper to sudo. You can do something like:

gksudo --message "fix the time" your-script.sh


and it will pop up a window prompting you for your password so you don't
need to launch  a terminal.

Though as has been pointed out elsewhere NTPD is the tool to use if you
have a permanent Internet connection.

While I'm on the subject it is recommended you use the local
pool.ntp.org server i.e. us.ntp.pool.org as you will get a better result
and it avoids overloading the main servers.

It all depends on how much your time gets shifted suddenly when you use 
ntpdate.  I learned the hard way when that happens all Hell breaks loose 
on a server. If your time kicks backwards by as little as 110 seconds 
all of a sudden, Dovecot will panic and kill itself-- it even announced 
in the log that it was "going to kill myself"), so you lose your IMAP 
connections right away. Other software starts whinging too. The RBL spam 
blocker I had running suddenly started "synchronizing" with its friends 
in Berkeley and elsewhere every few minutes (and since I didn't know at 
the time what this "synchronizing" was all about and coincidentally I 
was just then getting hit with a super large volume of spam (53Mb as it 
turned out, over a couple of hours ). Every daemon starting writing log 
entries at once. Then the Amavis daemon (virus checker) gave up its 
ghost and keeled over dead. I was also getting hundreds of error 
messages from Named like: "validating @0x7f82840008c0: 115.in-addr.arpa 
DNSKEY: bad cache hit (115.in-addr.arpa/DS): 1 Time(s)".  XNTPD got 
killed too after complaining about "no servers reachable", and 
"...cannot be used reason: temporary failure in name resolution." (the 
DNS stopped working too.)

I'm not a wizard at the sysadmin stuff so I 'm not sure if it was the 
boatload of spam that washed in over the transom  just as the time 
change incident occurred, or if it was just the sudden time shift alone, 
or both, but it really rocked /my/ boat. But as I RTFM'ed the Dovecot 
docs later ttrying to figure out WTF happened  the  section in 
TimeMovedBackwards on Dvoecot's wiki 
(http://wiki.dovecot.org/TimeMovedBackwards) explains all the horrible 
things that could happen and make Dovecot's best option being just to 
fall upon its sword.

But I did learn one lesson clearly. Don't fool around with 'date' 
--especially the -s option--  when you're logged in as root so you can 
tinker with a script that has to run as root!

OK....

I can see that running NTPD is the only thing to do........

Thanks for the examples....

The box in question is an Intrepid desktop that has no root
password set. The only password that exists is jjj's password.
Therefore, the "could not authenticate" error message was perplexing.
Yes, I checked the capslock key.

Half an hour later I noticed some other things were acting weird on the
box in question. Windows were redrawing strangely. Stuff was taking
forever to respond. A solid black line suddenly appeared across the
monitor, as though the LCD screen had a defect. In the end I decided to
reboot (first time in about six months). Afterward I had no problem
"unlocking" stuff with my password. 

Something was messed up. I'll probably never know what. I do intend to
create a root password on the box, however. Just as soon as I figure
out how to do so on Ubuntu.

It's not recommended practice, but if you simply must have a root
password then the command is: "sudo passwd root".

But really you should try doing without and getting used to using sudo.

What the ...?

I strongly disagree.

One cannot use sudo where there are issues at boot and the system is
in run level one prompting for a root password to do (for example) file system
maintenance. 

Without the root PW you're in a world of hurt. 
Bootable CDs are not a reliable answer either. 

Yes, use sudo for
day to day work.? But have a password on the root account for when it is
required.

Message-ID: <4BCE1623.6020600@tempusdictum.com>


I'm running sshd on a server and I've set:

   PermitRootLogin no

But I _assumed_ it would stop attempts like the following:

-----------------------
Apr 19 07:11:49 huntlab sshd[15840]: pam_unix(sshd:auth): authentication
failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=204.228.225.88

Apr 19 07:11:50 huntlab sshd[15840]: Failed password for root from
204.228.225.88 port 50082 ssh2
-----------------------

And I've heard babble about PAM settings and such.  So, I'm thinking
that I just don't have it locked up completely.  I expected the sshd
server to immediately refuse the connection without having to go through
the challenge response or password auth.  Does anyone have any clues to
hit me with?

It won't let them login even if they guess the right password.

But aside from explicitly firewalling every IP you won't ever want to
connect from completely, you're pretty well stuck in reactionary mode:
 wait for the (guaranteed to fail) attempt and then block it.

i use the program 'denyhosts' to kick people off the lawn after 3
failed login attempts.  but it only defends against IP's that knock 3
times.  still a lot better to read logs with 3 attempts in, than 3000.
 and it's pretty versatile so can work for other services (ftp for
instance) that someone might also try to break into with brute force
repeated attempts.

i don't know of anything like that, but if you find something that
isn't talked about on list, please let us know!

I used to use denyhosts but found these iptables rules a touch more 
proactive.

-N SSH_WHITELIST
-A SSH_WHITELIST -s $any_ip_or_range -m recent --remove --name SSH -j ACCEPT

# $any_ip_or_range is an IP or range you don't want tested.
# I ran into a Windows client that hammered and I sometimes
# log into several Linux-Vserver guests in a very short period.

-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent 
--set --name SSH
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -j

# four failed attempts in 60 seconds and the connection just gets
# dropped

-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent

# other rules go here with this near the end.

I ran into this with a Fedora 12 install.  With my netbook I 
needed/wanted to log in graphically as root so I modified 
/etc/pamd.d/{gdm,gdm-password} and and commented out the lines:

auth	required	pam_succeed_if.so user != root quiet

in both.  Old habits die slowly (if at all) so I still log in as root; 
sometimes at a workstation and quite often to the servers I admin.

The only thing about ssh that comes to mind are the lines:

auth	optional	pam_gnome_keyring.so
session	optional	pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start

which, I think, let me login with my ssh pass phrase (like doing 
add-agent) or account password.

Ahhh, thanks.  So, I infer that as long as challenge response is on, it
evaluates the login/password simultaneously?  I suppose I'll have to
RTFM on sshd to see how this all works in detail.  It just seems
reasonable to me that they would handshake, the client would request a
login with password auth, then the server would check for disallowed
password auth logins, see that root is in there, then immediately hit
back with a "permission for password login denied" or somesuch.

Yep!  I really like denyhosts; but I've only used it for ssh so far.

Wilco.  Rods iptables rules look interesting.  I really like the
teergrube idea with smtp... and just dropping the connection with no
response at least increases the attacking script's latency, which
appeals to me....

Thanks again.

I agree with Michael. I have had a root password set for a long time,
even back in the days when I had Ubuntu on my laptop. I was surprised
to discover that I had never created a root password on my Ubuntu
desktop. 

And now that I have Fedora on my laptop I note that the install utility
prompted me for a root password automatically, but I had to add myself
to the sudoers list before I could use sudo. I like the idea of using
sudo for day to day stuff, but when push comes to shove it's nice to be
able to become root for real.

Truth be told, I use the same password for myself and for root. But I
live alone and the only others with access to either computer is
the occasional burglar. And if a burglar gets their hands on the
computer, the password will be a moot point. In fact, I do backups more
out of fear of thieves than of disk failure.

Do whatever to corrupt your disk so you need to run fsck in single user mode at boot.

Here is what I did and was unsuccessful at creating a problem.  On my
system, /dev/sda1 contains the root '/' filesystem, so I tried this:

1) booted with a LiveCD
2) typed this in a terminal:

$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero count=200 bs=1 \
of=/dev/sda1 seek=50000 conv=notrunc

3) rebooted, ejecting CD
4) Ubuntu came up just fine.

I wanted to get prompted for a root password and this didn't work.
What am I missing?

- Robert

Do you know if the connector is a type M or N power plug? These are available 
at Radio Shack.

Also we have noticed that the internet shuts down after 5 minutes and want to 
know if it continues automatically if it finds the aux. power is available.  
Did you try to leave the normal battery connecected and wait for longer than 
the 5 minute period to see if things stayed up?  If not could you try that 
experiment.

yikes, that's dangerous!  you just overwrote 200 bytes in a random
place on your disk.  some file is corrupted somewhere--hope it's not
your magnum opus or a config file you changed.  if you notice a random
program crashing, you've won.

in all likelihood it will never bite you since i think most people
don't use most files on their system (tens of thousands of files on a
typical modern system are documentation or bits of development
environment that will never be touched by someone who isn't
reading/trying new things a lot), but it also was unlikely (or maybe
impossible?  i'm guessing that mount time checks are limited to
looking to see if you requested an fsck or if something marked the
filesystem dirty, not actually walking inode tables.  someone correct
me if you know otherwise, please!)

the best way to force an fsck is to make a temporary filesystem, add
it to fstab, and intentionally screw *it* up--then you won't lose
stuff that you might someday need.  it can be a tiny filesystem and
your dd methodology is sound, just start 512 bytes in and write for
awhile to make sure you hit the inode table.

Nope, nothing important.  The joys of running in a virtual environment.

> if you notice a random program crashing, you've won.

The goal was not to crash a random program.  The goal was to create an
"... [issue] at boot [so that] the system is in run level one
prompting for a root password to do (for example) file system
maintenance" in Ubuntu.

If someone knows how to create such an issue, I'm curious to hear about it.

and the goal of my statement was not to say you succeeded, but that
you were lucky to discover what you screwed up rather than having it
be something subtle that takes you forever to track down.

Yes, I saw this:

Here is my interpretation of those instructions:

$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/just-for-fun bs=1M count=100
$ sudo mkfs.ext3 -F /just-for-fun
$ sudo mkdir /media/jff
$ echo "/just-for-fun /media/jff ext3 loop 0 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
$ sudo reboot

It mounted just fine.  So we now have a temporary filesystem.  Now to
mess it up:

$ sudo umount /media/jff
$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=200 \
  of=/just-for-fun seek=50000 conv=notrunc
$ sudo reboot

Again, booted just fine.  No prompting for root password.  Now to
really trash the filesystem:

$ sudo umount /media/jff
$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/just-for-fun bs=1M count=100
$ sudo reboot

Boots but halts at trying to mount the /just-for-fun filesystem.
Still no prompting for root password.

I guess I need to rephrase my request: if anyone has some commands or
code or a test-case that causes Ubuntu to prompt for a root password
at startup, please post.

Regards,

BTW, if you find yourself in this situation, you can get out of it by
using one of the boot options:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Initrd%20break%20points

In this particular case, break=bottom works well as it mounts the root
partition, allowing one to fix the /etc/fstab before continuing the
boot process.

If you have a root password set and boot single-user, you could simply
login as root, no?

Nope.  The boot process halts before any chance to log in, even with a
password set for root.

Although I do like to have a root password set, if I ever get a system
that will not boot I immediately reach for my GRML rescue CD. GRML is
command line only, but better than any other I have ever used. It has a
complete set of tools - nano, vi(m), mdadm, fdisk, e2fsck, grub, etc. It
also automounts every partition and leaves me at a root prompt. There
is also Knoppix, but GRML is leaner and faster because it was designed
specifically for fixing systems that won't boot.

   Does anyone know a way to have emac's speedbar recogznize .sql files? I
know the tool works great with C and Python files, but now I am editing a
few SQL files and it would be nice to quickly switch among them in the
current buffer.

If you can't find an sql-specific mode for the speedbar, you can
always make it show all files.  When emacs is running in a windowing
environment (as opposed to a terminal), you can right-click in the
speedbar and choose 'show all files' from the speedbar submenu.

M-x speedbar-toggle-show-all-files will accomplish the same thing, if
you'd rather do it that way (or set it automatically).

Rogan,

   Thank you. I'll use that the next time. Today I used the buffer menu
instead.

I played a little with Olimex's USB-ARM-OCD device talking to an ARM
core'd CPU last fall, but I don't remember doing any gdb-ish stuff.
Not sure if that's remotely helpful.

I dunno.  OpenOCD isn't seeing the interface chip, even though I seem to 
be doing everything right.  I'm sure it's the usual Linux thing where 
every link in the chain is there but one -- I just haven't found that 
link, yet!

Does OpenOCD know about the CPU?  My openocd.cfg points indirectly at
a ks8695p.cfg file that looks something like this:

  # Target configuration for the Micrel/Kendin KS8695P SoC
  # Tested on a PePLink WINTI03 board from a SkyPilot SkyExtender
  # DualBand
  # Core: ARM922T
  # Info: 

  if { [info exists CHIPNAME] } { 
     set  _CHIPNAME $CHIPNAME    
  } else {         
     set  _CHIPNAME ks8695p
  }

  if { [info exists ENDIAN] } {   
     set  _ENDIAN $ENDIAN    
  } else {         
    # this defaults to a bigendian
     set  _ENDIAN little
  }

  if { [info exists CPUTAPID ] } {
     set _CPUTAPID $CPUTAPID
  } else {
    # force an error till we get a good number
     set _CPUTAPID 0x00922f0f
  }

  #jtag scan chain
  jtag newtap $_CHIPNAME cpu -irlen 4 -ircapture 0x1 -irmask 0x0f
  -expected-id $_CPUTAPID

  set _TARGETNAME [format "%s.cpu" $_CHIPNAME]
  target create $_TARGETNAME arm920t -endian $_ENDIAN -chain-position
  $_TARGETNAME

I recall that the irlen, ircapture and irmask required a fair amount
of guess-and-trying before I hit on the right combination.

Two or three years ago I used OpenOCD briefly during the initial bring 
up of a board with an NXP LPC2136.  I never used it with GDB.  I just 
did basic peek and poke stuff.  My JTAG interface was a simple 
parallel port dongle from Sparkfun.

Message-ID: <4BD34255.70309@comcast.net>

This is another phase of the thread, 2nd Router Setup.

At last week's clinic we figured out how to set up my WRT54G as a 
wireless access point to use with a WET11 bridge. The subject of 
security arose and after a short conversation we decided I should try 
using the WRT54G in 802.11b mode for two reasons: 1, the WET11 only 
works on 802.11b, and 2, the wireless signal range of 802.11b is shorter 
than 802.11g.

This morning I installed the WRT54G in the basement and started walking 
around with my laptop checking out the range. I got all bars showing 
green up in my office on the 2nd floor and directly above the WRT54G. I 
went outside and started walking up the driveway. By the time I got to 
the street the laptop was still showing 2 bars. I thought, "Well, it's 
clearly loosing signal strength. Maybe if I put a shield of some sort 
between the WRT54G and the outside wall of the basement, which is the 
direction of the street, maybe that will block the signal in that 
direction." So, I took an aluminum cookie sheet and set it between the 
wall and the WRT54G. I went back up the driveway and saw that, while it 
dropped to 2 bars by the time I got to the street, It took longer to do 
so, i.e. my shield worked to improve the signal strength!

So, now I have radio questions:

Would a shield work?

Does it have to be grounded in order to be effective?

BTW, I'm less concerned about the other three directions away from the 
house because it's twice as far or farther from the location of the 
WRT54G to the nearest neighbor in all three directions as it is to the 
street.

Dick,

You could go through the trouble of trying to shield the signal but I
think it would be better to just make sure the 54G is using encryption
(i.e WPA2) and you could turn off the SSID broadcast so that the AP
won't be seen unless someone is using something like net stumbler or
the like. And if you want to be even more paranoid, you could also set
MAC filtering up in order to ensure that only the machines in your
home are allowed to connect to the AP.

I'll look into that. I have yet to go deep enough into the WEP11 to 
figure out what it has in that regard.

I believe I did that already, but I'll double check.

We talked about that at the clinic and ruled it out as a false sense of 
security since someone with the right equipment could observe what MAC 
addresses are being used and spoof one of them.

Thanks for the ideas.

At some point you need to compare the cost of all these security
measures to their supposed benefit. What is the probability that
anyone cares enough about gaining access to your network that they'd
go to all the trouble of sniffing out the SSID, MAC addresses,
cracking your WEP, etc.? Rather quite low, I'd bet. It may be a better
use of your time to focus on host security instead.

Minor point - at a given power setting, the wireless range of 802.11b is 
greater than 802.11g, esp. in a clear LOS environment.

Probably right. For years I've counted on my router hiding my house from 
the outside world. I do have trouble getting from one machine to another 
inside the house, sometimes (XP machines talking to Linux machines) but 
I haven't put the effort into understanding all the issues involved in 
good network security.

I worked in Network Security for a few years and here's a few things to
keep in mind.

1. Security, wireless or otherwise, is best in layers.

2. What is it that your trying to protect and is it worth someone going
through the effort of trying to steal and potentially getting caught? 

If it's Files on your home computer, run firewall software. If it's
internet communications, I'd be more concerned about Browser and OS
security then someone connecting a Sniffer to your wireless network and
capturing a username/password. Very time intensive and not easily done.

If it's files, secure the computer with a good software firewall.

3. The sale of network security software, appliances, consulting
services is largely based on fear mongering. There are only a very few
people who possess the skills and drive of people like Dan Farmer and
Kevin Mitnick. And most of those people are after much bigger fish. The
rest are lazy people who use scripts to exploit known vulnerabilities.

Radio signals are quite long and will find their way around things
[dispersion]. So the signal might be slightly less at one point but move
a few degrees one way or the other and you can pick it up. 

Or you could build a 'Faraday Cage' around your house. If you choose 
this option, give me a call, this would be a fun weekend project... :-)

Interesting. But, it's a moot point since the WET11 only speaks 802.11b.

By the time we got the Faraday cage built, I could have taken apart the 
t & g cedar ceiling and run a CAT-5 cable across the basement. Then I 
would have some wireless equipment to put up on Craig's list!

Interesting project, though. I've wondered if movie theater builders 
ever thought of it.

802.11b is also slow. There is no reason to set the router to B only. 
Use WPA2 and a good password. Done.

Slow was part of the strategy to make it less desirable. Probably lame, 
but there you are.

The only device that will be using wireless in this house is the WET11, 
which will be connected to a ReplayTV DVR. And the WET11 only speaks

won't be using it wirelessly on a day-to-day basis. I have wired

Passwording is a good idea, and I should figure out if the WET11 can 
have one loaded into it to use to access the WRT54G. Re-configuration of 
sharing on our XP and Linux machines so that only a "transfer" directory 
is shared on each machine, and that we move things out of them quickly, 
has been deemed to be sufficient by my wife.

Thanks for the ideas.

Dick,

Just a note that you can operate in a mixed environment. You should be
able to set the WRT54G to use B/G mode thereby not affecting the
WET11. From what I've gathered from previous posts you're also in a
less dense housing area so you shouldn't have to worry too much about
wifi thieves.

Maybe network security might be another topic that could be covered
during a meeting if we lack speakers. I'd volunteer to share what I've
used and know.

Understood.

As mentioned, operating in b only was part of a possibly lame strategy. 
If I ever decide I want to use the laptop elsewhere on the property, I 
can always switch to mixed mode.

I figured that was the case, too. It's part of the reason I'm less 
concerned about it than my wife is. However, the advice given on this 
list today has eased her concerns.

Good plan. I suspect there are at least a few others on the list that 
are more users than sys admins. Most of the time I'm on a system where 
someone else is in charge of network security.

For now, the system is up and running. The last step my wife wants me to 
do is to take the laptop out and see how far I have to walk up and down 
the street to lose signal. It's not raining right now, so I'll go do that.

Thanks to all for all the good advice and support.

I am trying to write an ncurses application in emacs. When I run it using
M-x gdb, the output appears in an emacs buffer. But the buffer is useless
when using ncurses.

I would like to either have the output go to an external xterm, or have the
emacs output buffer run under ansi-term. Either method would solve the
ncurses display issue. Any suggestions for how to make emacs do this?

I found this, which works:


http://cdw.sourceforge.net/documentation/emacs_gdb_ncurses/emacs_gdb_ncurses.en.html

But it is a PITA to run all these gdb commands at the beginning of each
debugging session. Is there a nice hook in emacs where I can put this stuff,
or should I use .gdbinit? Thinking the latter is better.

Hello all,

Many of the other posters covered several points on what I'm about to
say, but I'll summarize my thoughts briefly.  I've done a number of
wireless penetration tests in the past and I keep up with many of the
cryptographic details related to the current protocols.

This is very true.  It is trivial to spoof MAC addresses under Linux,
without any special equipment.  MAC address filtering provides the
security of Telnet, so it's not worth the effort and maintenance.

The problem with this argument is the assumption that doing this stuff
is "hard".  Even if the attacks are complex for a computer, if
push-button tools let you do it with little effort and maybe a few
hours of sniffing/cracking, then the bar is still pretty low.  

What would an attacker want from Richard's network?  Who knows.  Maybe
just free bandwidth, or a way to anonymize other illegal activities.
Maybe the gain isn't worth the effort, but with many insecure wireless
(WEP included) networks, the effort is really small to begin with.

Here's what I recommend for security:

- Forget about signal strength and when it might drop off.  This only
  stops people who don't have big antennas.

- Don't bother with WEP.  It's essentially completely broken in
  multiple ways.

- Avoid WPA1 if you can.  It's a badly designed protocol with elements
  of backward compatibility from WEP.  It's not totally broken yet,
  but there are certain attacks and published tools out there.

- WPA2 (specifically CCMP) should be solid.

- Be sure to pick a network SSID which is not common.  Then pick a
  good password for the network.  In order to brute-force a password
  with WPA, one needs to incorporate the SSID into the process, so
  precomputation attacks on your network can be thwarted by picking an
  uncommon SSID.  (In other words, don't leave it as "linksys" or
  something like that.)

- If your AP software doesn't support WPA1/2, then consider
  firewalling off access and only allow routing via OpenVPN.  It's
  quite good and not terribly difficult to set up.


Hope that helps Richard and anyone else with a wireless network.

I don't imagine mine is common, but it's not totally odd. On the other 
hand, I've turned off SSID broadcast, so the average guy running around 
in my neighborhood won't see it, anyway.

Thanks. I'll incorporate your ideas into my setup.

Since I can't evaluate them, I assume any wireless security system
is subject to careful observation and side-channel attack.  Protocols
come in two flavors - compromised, and soon-to-be-compromised.

So, I run my wireless system open, without encryption, on a DMZ port
on my ALIX router.  I use the same process to connect to my inside
systems via wifi as I am doing from the Sunnyvale Motel 6 room I
am in now - VPN and SSH.   Same weak link, same strong protocols.

     Open wireless access point on DMZ Port

Verizon WAN Port ---- ALIX ---------------- wired LAN Port
             <---- VPN ---->

Subject: [PLUG] Fedora 12 and vmware mess...
Message-ID: <1272179930.2327.12.camel@localhost>

Well, the Fedora group needs to get busy and tune the system up.  I am
having major speed problems and I had to do something quite strange to
get Dirk Dashing and Rick Rocket working with sound.  I had to uninstall
a pulseaudio alsa backend rpm.  I also had to install an obnoxious
number of debuginfo rpm packages.  Do delete all the SDL libraries from
the game directories.  Another tip on Rick Rocket, add /usr/lib to the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the rickrocket script.

Vmware player 3 doesn't work at all on Fedora 12 unless you
rename /usr/lib/vmware/resources/mozilla-root-certs.crt.  Sadly, it
appears without this certificate in the right place with the right name
that it is impossible to update vmware tools.  My Windows 2000 VM
created using VMWare Workstation 6.5 is obnoxiously slow on Fedora 12
under VMWare Player 3.01.  Apparently, workstation 7 doesn't work any
better than the player.  I upgraded from CentOS 5.4 because CentOS is
too far behind for a desktop system.  Unfortunately, Fedora 12 seems to
be shaky at best.

I have a 3.06 Ghz P4 with 1.5 gigabytes of ram. This isn't the fastest
personal system on the planet, but it shouldn't crawl either.  I realize
that I probably need to go 64 bit and multi core soon, but that looks
too costly at the moment.

Sun VirtualBox on the other hand seems to work fine on Fedora 12.  Now
then, if only there was a converter to go from vmware to virtualbox...
I think they don't care, the folks who produce vmware.  Go google search
for trouble running vmware player on Fedora 12 and people are saying
that a new release of everything is needed.

Does anyone know if the company that produces vmware virtualization
software has essentially given up on Fedora?

All,

I have been, with the help of this list, weaning myself and family from 
the world of Micro$oft.  I started out with SUSE somewhere around the 
6.* version.  I followed a small crowd running the other direction when 
Novell started contracting with the Redmond community.

I landed in the Kubuntu environment.  Kubuntu 9.10, in my experience, 
fell flat on it's ISO.  I assumed it was growing pains of the latest 
KDE.  I installed Ubuntu on my "it has to work" machine and then used 
the other laptop to tinker with 10.04 (starting with Alpha 2) of both 
Ubuntu and Kubuntu.  Neither seems to be very spectacular in what it 
does.  I haven't had any major problems, though I am far from a power user.

I ran across this article this morning and wondered what other folks 
might think.  I hope I am not inviting a flame war.  I am still a 
husband/father/truck driver and don't have time to research this myself.

I would like some comment from your vast pool of experience as to what 
this writer said.  Most of my curiosity  stems from the latter half of 
this article.  Pointers to articles, other distros, etc. are all 
welcomed.  If they come with your observations or opinions, so much the 
better.

The xorg.conf thing missing that the writer points out isn't just an
Ubuntu thing, it's an Xorg thing. I think that's where some of the
disconnect and confusion comes into play about Ubuntu, it just
packages software like any other distro and are at the mercy of
upstream devs when it comes to startling changes like removing the
xorg config file, FWIW you can create it that file and still use it
like it was in previous versions.

How old are those games? You can't really blame the distro if things
like ALSA and OSS are deprecated for something better like Pulse
Audio.

I doubt they've given up but the free stuff they release doesn't make
them money .. I'm sure they focus more on the money making products

Another thing that I see is that Ubuntu has gone with upstart for
their init processing.
Most of the other distros use sysVinit so things are really different
for startup.
I don't know what other projects use upstart.  Nice idea.  Still evolving.

The process of just one choice of application per operation type helps
prevent confusion.
You can still install the gimp or other packages. It's just their
choice of defaults.  The gimp
does have a steep learning curve.

You could also use virt-manager with qemu for built in virtualization.
Virtualbox will use the vmware images (at least that is what their docs say).

They are focused on pushing the community forward with libvirt and the other
pieces like virt-manager.

Well, IMHO, the article is mainly a subjective opinion about Ubuntu.  The
point about Xorg is silly-if he would have typed "man xorg" in the mystery
terminals he couldn't find it would have told him all about the new Xorg.
As for the endless "GNU vs (insert whatever here)" debate that has been
raging since before there was a Ubuntu, well, most of the old timers really
don't care anymore.  I started with Linux back in the Debian Slink/Potato
time, tried some Mandrake in there as well (Which was heavily criticized at
the time for being too "windowsy"), eventually moving to Ubuntu 5.10 and
bouncing between Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Mint and Arch since then.  At some point
I just have to say I'm used to apt (or pacman), I know how to set up a Buntu
or Arch distro exactly how I like it.  I loathe KDE 4.x, I rarely need to
tinker with runlevels on my home computer...so...
I can say I keep continually returning to Ubuntu mainly due to ease and
polish.  My mom can use it.  the simple fact is there are a lot of distros
out there for any flavor or style.  if you like typing "init 3" to begin the
tweaking process, go with Fedora.  Otherwise just sudo aptitude install gimp
and drive on.

My thought:  Ubuntu might not be the best choice for an "it has to
work" machine.  That's not to insult or disparage Ubuntu, it's just a
reflection of Ubuntu being a reasonably bleeding-edge distro, akin to
Fedora.  Any bleeding-edge anything is likely to have some bugs &
burps that creep into the shiny and new.  Often, the problems that
distros get blamed for are the result of bugs (or, design decisions or
implementation changes that might be controversial) upstream, as Drew
already mentioned with regard to the missing xorg.conf.  To some
extent, it is the responsibility of distros to put together a fully
functioning whole, but in practice there are so many moving parts that
it simply isn't possibly to be up-to-the-minute and completely free of
sometimes show-stopping bugs or usability issues.  And when upstream
devs do something that annoys a lot of users, it's always the
bleeding-edge distro's users that get exposed to the annoyance first.

Personally, I'd stay with something that doesn't prioritize the latest
and greatest over stability or usability for an "it has to work"
machine -- especially in light of your unsatisfying experience with
KDE/Kubuntu.  In the Debian universe, there is nothing more stable
than Debian stable itself.  In the Red Hat universe, many here have
talked about Scientific Linux or CentOS.

Good points Michael. I think one thing that I took away from that
article as well was that it appears from the perspective of the writer
that corporate interests, in this case Canonical, take away from the
interests of the user base and that there seems to be a communication
problem between the developers and the community and maybe that's
where most of his problem is and not with the changes themselves. What
seems to get lost in the discussion in my opinion is that Ubuntu for
better or worse has become the face of desktop linux in many ways and
with its notoriety and large install base it gets blamed for some
things that have nothing to do with the distro itself (see the xorg
complaint which is silly to me).

My version of an "it has to work" is simply email, browser, & 
sky.fm/smooth jazz player.

The most important thing I do is moderate an email discussion list.

To date, Ubuntu has caused me no hardships.  Fedora, for the short time 
I had it installed, seemed rock solid under my conditions.  Debian 
deserves another try.  I admittedly got frustrated with it when I tried 
it some time back.  Don't remember what it was that I stumbled with, but 
it wasn't worth the time then.

Thanks for the input!

I think this is where my questions started.  If Canonical is going the 
way of the commercial interest, then perhaps it is time to change.  The 
flip side of that...the buck has to stop somewhere and someone always

Well said Bruce, the buck does indeed not to stop somewhere. My take
is that Canonical isn't so much bowing to corporate interests and
ignoring the community but that the community is now so large, there
isn't going to be the consensus and ability to make every user happy
anymore.

 It happens with most successful start ups at some point. That early
excitement and enthusiasm and hard work to make users happy changes
when the user base grows to a point you have to decide that meeting
the middle is better and more worse the risk even if it means
alienating those who supported you in your early days.

I think the other part of this, being accused of bowing to corporate
interests especially in the linux world is seen as evil and will be
something that distro providers who, like Canonical and Red Hat will
have to find a way to balance in order to be financially successful
and not violate the spirit from which they were born.

If you like KDE over Gnome, Mandriva 2010 One is an excellent choice. Try it
out and see for yourself.
Mandriva does a better job with KDE than Kubuntu.

Misguided, at best.  Not a single argument holds weight.

Command line - boot into recovery mode, or if you want to get fancy,
add 'break' to your kernel line in grub.  You'll get a command line
with a busybox shell.

Runlevels - they are antiquated.  Upstart is just one solution to the
problem. Ubuntu has implemented a transition to runlevels, if you
still want them: create an /etc/inittab file.

Xorg - same issue.  Create an xorg.conf file.

Gimp - it didn't fit on the CD.  Still available via apt-get or synaptic.

Window buttons on left - easily changed.

Ubuntu has its flaws, just like every other Linux distro, and just
like everything else.  But for me it gets ~95% right of what I want.
For the other ~5% I can change it, and I do.

Regards,
- Robert

I totally agree with Robert.  I've used all of the major distros. I feel
Ubuntu is the best one.  Yes, the upstream dev's change how things work.  We
learn what the changes are, and adapt.  In the end, I haven't see any
changes that I disagree with. Even the xorg.conf issue, which I hated
initially.  Now--I know how to configure without it and don't even consider
it an issue.

Just my tiny 2 cents,

Aaron

With all due respect, the author of these Linux games worked with me to
troubleshoot them.  Troy is working on Dirk Dashing 2 which hasn't come
out yet.  What good is an upgrade if all the old software that people
actually have gets broken by it?

I have been a registered user of vmware workstation, I am not impressed
that Fedora 12 support is poor.  If the free products don't work, I am
not even going to consider buying workstation.  Fedora is a very popular
main line distribution of Linux, albeit it may be a little too bleeding
edge.  CentOS is too much of a dinosaur for anything other than a
server.  If only there was a project to continue improving the version
of Fedora behind the current version so that there is a middle of the
road option.

Ubuntu has become the great desktop Linux hope. I've run various flavors
of it over the years w. varying levels of joy/frustration. Ubuntu has
always strived for the "it works out of the box" experience. Which I
think most people want when the come from the MS Win world. 

As I became more Linux savvy I started running Debian (Sarge & Etch). I
found it to be faster, more stable and w. a much larger software repo
than Ubuntu. But because Debian stable could easily be 2 yrs behind the
latest Ubuntu release some things were just not a pleasant user
experience; audio subsystem, wireless connectivity, dual/external
monitor setup.

But I perserved and learned how to make these things work. I realize not
everyone has the time nor inclination. 

Personally, I like Debian a lot. I like their belief in keeping things
free and open, I like that they test the hell out of stuff. If I just
want something that works, I reach for Debian. Does it take some time &
effort to get it working they way I want it to? Sure it does. But I
wouldn't want it any other way. If I did, I'd rn Win 7 or MAC OSX. 

In the end, the more hands-on experience I get w. Linux the better the
user experience is and the less I'm affected/controlled by political and
developler decisions. But you have to flexible and adaptable too. For
instance I recently had to drop Thunderbird after happily using it for
years because now it won't open URLs in an email with an external
browser unless you intsall a plugin. It has tabs now and wants to open
the URL in the mail cleint. This hogs my cpu and freezes up my laptop w.
3GB RAM. So, Evolution is my mail client now. 

Everything has it's flaws/problems. The trick is to figure out what you
can live with and can't live without. For me right now that's 'Sidux', a
distro built from Debian Sid/Squeeze.

I certainly meant no disrespect. At some point software gets old and
new things come along in terms of hardware/software and it totally
sucks when something that you're used to and also enjoy doesn't work
properly especially when you've paid for it. But such is software I
guess. Very nice of the dev to work with you to troubleshoot it btw.

You may want to try Mepis 8.5

http://www.mepis.org/

I've sampled just about every major distro and Mepis 8.5 seems to more
closely approximate Windows install-and-play friendliness than any
other. It has by far the best KDE implementation, great fonts, useful
user GUI tools and it comes loaded with the basic goodies Windows users
expect, a working FLASH-plugin, multimedia codecs, etc. I've found Mepis
8.5 the best out of the box Linux available, missing only ufw or some
other firewall front end, about the only must-have Windows refugees will
need to download from their Debian repository.  Mepis still employs a
simple useful great-looking boot-loader (grub-legacy w/gfxboot) that you
won't need to be a dark-basement geek to tune to your needs.  

I moved to Ubuntu back in the Hardy days after watching Windows
degenerate in user friendliness, security and even stability from
NT-4/Win2K (great!) --> WinXP (faulty but tolerable) --> Vista (just
plain awful). I still use Ubuntu (10.4-rc) today because for me it
combines some level of user friendliness with just enough complexity and
gotchas to encourage the user to learn about their OS "under the hood"
so to speak. 

Every user is different in their needs tolerances and expectations. To
me this is Linux's greatest strength. That it offers so many different
takes on a basic OS that is a) totally free and b) in most ways much
better than Windows. 

You may also want to scope out Distrowatch to learn more about various
Linux flavors

Thank you very much for the responses so far.  I am not really 
interested in a "Windows" experience.  I am more familiar with KDE than 
Gnome, only because that is what I was introduced to in the beginning.  
I am not opposed to one or the other.  When I installed both in the 
Alpha stages, I wanted KDE to work better.

It doesn't on my Lenovo Idea Pad.  The one glaring difference...Ubuntu 
sounds better listening to smooth jazz than KDE.  But then, Vista drives 
the subwoofer on this laptop and, so far, Linux doesn't.  I think it 
possible, and realize I just haven't found the fix yet.

Thanks all for the suggestions for a different distribution.  I will try 
as many as I can as soon as I clear the test box and install my choice 
around April, 29th on the must work computer.

Keep your comments coming, please.  I am enjoying this conversation.

Bruce

The author of that article is mostly misguided and has failed to
understand a lot of things. Someone decided that the Gimp wouldn't fit
on the CD unless other more important stuff was eliminated. You can
always install it yourself. Ditto for just about all the other
complaints.

As for Shuttleworth saying that Ubuntu is not a democracy, well, that's
true of most distros. There is frequently one key person who started the
distro and keeps it afloat. That person decides what will be included
and what will not. In fact, I think Ubuntu responds to user input
better than many. And if you're worried about a for-profit corporation
owning the distro, then you'd better stay away from Mandriva, OpenSuse,
Fedora, and several others. 

I lived happily with Ubuntu for my first several years in Linux,
although today I use Fedora 11. I take my hat off to Ubuntu.
Shuttleworth's big claim to fame is that he said several years ago that
it was time for Linux on the desktop. Considering the massive user base
of Ubuntu, he was right. Hardly anyone else had the gumption to target
the desktop user base. The success of Ubuntu has brought millions of
new users to Linux. How can that be bad for Linux? If Shuttleworth
thinks he is entitled to maintain control of the distro, I'm happy to
let him. 

There always seems to be a group who think that if someone is
successful they must have done something wrong to get there. I don't
know Shuttleworth, but I have met the man and heard him speak. I also
know his story. He's OK in my book.

The great thing these days, is that most distros can either be run as a
"Live CD" or boot of a thumb drive. So you can check out more distros in
less time, with less hassle.

BTW, I wasn't suggesting that you wanted a MS Win experience or that
somehow that is a bad thing. We get used to things and then it's hard to
change. I remember the days when I had to use Solaris every know and
then at work. And I would curse at it all the time. Now I find myself
cursing when Outlook hangs or when I have to reboot to install Win
updates or use complex, bloated apps like MS Office.

Someday, I would like to run a more Unix like OS such as DragonFly BSD
on my laptop.

Your laptop has a subwoofer? How big is this laptop?

It isn't a very large speaker and is located on the bottom of a 15" 
laptop.  Like I said, I will find the answer to running it under Linux.  
It sounds pretty good under Vista, for a laptop sound system.

All,

Can anyone recommend good tutorials on the web for linux in terms of

I don't begrudge anybody their success.  Fact of the matter is I admire 
those that are successful.

Bill Gates and Linus Torvold (sp?) started out in a very similar 
fashion.  Bill with DOS in his garage, Linus in college.  Two similar 
products, different paths, look what they became.

I started with Linux due to a moral issue.  It was pointed out to me 
that by agreeing with the EULA I was partnering with the world's most 
well known criminals.  The argument has been made that Microsoft should 
have been dismantled by RICO statute some time back.  I liked what Mark 
Shuttleworth stands for and what he is doing.  I was just concerned by 
what that article said about decisions becoming political and wondered 
if the 'buntus would go the way that Microsoft did.

I still like (K)Ubuntu!

I don't like what KDE has become and may change to Ubuntu.  I may well 
take some of the suggestions in this thread and work/learn with 
something else for a time.

This is one of the things I think FOSS is all about.  The opportunity to 
choose what you want to work with, for the reasons you choose.

Is there a local shop that can repair these things? I have a 3U SmartUPS

load. APC has been more than helpful over the years but this time they 
tell me it's got a hardware problem. I'll spend the money to get a new 
one if I have to but if someone knows of a reliable repair shop I would 
like to get it checked out. Certified would be great, but not required.

I am in Texas so your mileage may vary but, I have always had good work 
done by Batteries Plus  and this search 
<http://www.batteriesplus.com/store_locator/state/OR.aspx> indicates 
they have ...
    2 stores in Portland
    1 store each in
       Beaverton
       Eugene
       Medford
       Salem
       Tualatin
... and no, I don't have any financial interest in them ... or any other 
interest in them except that I like the local store here.  Hope that helps

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1004261831030.20440@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My wife's laptop runs xubuntu-9.10, last updated January 4, 2010. The
seamonkey suite will not load. I tried upgrading the system, but after
several hours I see most file download attempts failed, and re-installing
seamonkey (at least, that's what I tried to do) also makes no difference.

   She had filled her ~/ with music files and probably eliminated some
seamonkey files trying to make room on the partition. I've since moved all
those files to a new partition, separate from /home so there's plenty of
space.

   I'd appreciate suggestions on what to test or what to try to get that
application running for her again.

TIA,

When I have a problem running something in X I will usually open a console
and then run the command to start the app and see if there is a specific
error causing the issue.  Then start to troubleshoot from there.

Are you getting a specific error then?

Some really good sites I regularly use:

http://www.linux.org/lessons/ => Great starting point for Basic/General
Linux Sys Admin tutorials.

http://www.howtoforge.com/ => A great site for tutorials on how to do almost
anything in Linux. Categorized by type of application and distro.

http://librenix.com/ => From commands, explanations of the Linux Kernel,
file systems, memory, etc, to tutorials on how to do almost anything in
Linux.

Hope you find these links helpful!

1st step is to collect data.

- What happens when you run 'strace'?

such as: "strace /opt/seamonkey" or whatever the path to the binary for
SeaMonkey is.

Aaron,

   Yes, I had tried that several times. Nothing displayed on the console
(such as 'file not found') and the application did not appear. That's why I
thought I was missing something because I could not identify a specific
problem.

Mike,

   Will do later this afternoon. Turns out that /usr/bin/seamonkey is a soft
link to /opt/seamonkey/seamonkey.

Can you try running the application as root or another user and see if
it starts correctly? I am wondering if it has to do with her prefs
file being mucked up.

Drew,

   Will do later this afternoon. She has messed up the system by filling her
~/ with copied music cd-roms. I've no idea what she did when trying to make
room on the partition.

   Strangely enough, when I tried to upgrade the system (last done 83 days
ago so I suspect the 'your system is up to date' is incorrect), it kept
failing to download links to archives and files.

   Not sure how I get everthing back to working again, but I'm open to all
advice and suggestions.

Rich

Install Ubuntu on an empty disk, then copy over the old 'home' directory?

It may serve as either a diagnostic or a fix.

(I rarely stay happy with Ubuntu after more than one or two upgrades; I 
often take an upgrade as an opportunity to clean house on the hard drive 
in just this way).

Subject: [PLUG] Sorta OT -- Good book on web site positioning
Message-ID: <4BD734CA.3000509@wescottdesign.com>

I've let my web site rot a bit -- when I started the business six years 
ago I would regularly show up in relevant searches.  Now Google has 
changed their algorithms, and I'm not popping up with the regularity I'd 
like -- and I'm seeing a proportional decline in new clients.

(What really sucks is that Google _used_ to put considerable weight on 
newsgroup postings, so all I had to do was stay active on newsgroups, 
answering questions that were interesting and within my competence, and 
business would come to me.  No more, alas).

So -- does anyone have recommendations for books on positioning a web 
site to come up in searches?  I'm not interested in learning how to be 
an HTML jockey -- I already know that.  I'm not interested in learning 
how to do any super-zoot high performance active web site design -- I 
don't have time for that (and I think it detracts from what I do).  What 
I /do/ want to know is how I can get my site to come up when folks go 
searching for people who do the sort of work that I do, hopefully 
without having to pay Google big bundles of bribe money.

I've found a few pointers, but this seems to be a book-length subject, 
so I'd kinda like to get a good hunk of dead tree that I can curl up 
with and study in the evenings when I have nothing better to do than 
take care of future business.

TIA.

   I've been using linux long enough to believe that almost everything is

I don't know any books, but here are my best suggestions:

1. Choose page titles that encorporate search keywords
2. Choose subheadings and page text likewise.
3. Run your HTML though tidy or some other syntax checker.
4. Don't rely on images to convey content without corresponding text.
5. Get other sites to link to yours.

I was sure (but didn't _know_) that there was something like this from 
Google, but I just couldn't find the right keywords.  "webmaster 
tools".  Of course.

The tools will help you understand where your traffic is coming from,
how google sees your site and things you can do to improve it within
the search rankings.

Actually, although I left Intrepid on my desktop computer (which only
streams radio and plays the odd dvd), my real computer is my laptop,
which now runs Fedora 11 x86_64. I am quite happy with Fedora 11,
although with the imminent release of Fedora 13 I need to figure out
how to do an apt-get dist-upgrade to Fedora 12. Can you tell I come
from the Ubuntu world? What gave me away?

More to the point, Lucid will be gold this Thursday. As soon as it is
available I will download it, as well as all the variations (Kubuntu,
Alternative, etc, etc.). I have pretty good bandwidth, so it takes me
little time, although the servers might be a bit choked up.

Anyone who needs a copy but has poor bandwidth, let me know and I'll
burn it for you. We can meet somewhere, or I'll bring it to the next
general meeting on May 6.

John, please put me on the list for Ubuntu.  It might take me from Thursday
to May 6th to download it myself.

You're on the list.

Actually, it occurred to me that all the versions will be on my laptop
hard drive, which will be with me at the meeting, so I can burn
anything ad hoc at the meeting.

Subject: [PLUG] Advisability of changing shell redirect
Message-ID: <4BD87A54.3050600@wescottdesign.com>

I'm winding up on an embedded project that will use the Texas 
Instruments LM3S811 embedded ARM processor.  Some searching around on 
the web shows me that there isn't much support to be found for the 
gnu-arm tool set any more -- all of the web pages with dates are several 
years old, and the ones without dates are all for building the tools 
with the old versions.

Whenever this situation is mentioned at all, links point to commercial 
sites, including Codesourcery, which does an "open source" gnu tool set 
-- but they sure don't publish their source very openly!!!

So, I cave.  I download their binary distribution of their "Codesourcery 
lite", and I run it.  I get the following message:

tim at servo:~/Downloads$ ./arm-2009q3-67-arm-none-linux-gnueabi.bin
The installer has detected that your system uses the dash shell
as /bin/sh.  This shell is not supported by the installer.
You can work around this problem by changing /bin/sh to be a
symbolic link to a supported shell such as bash.
For example, on Ubuntu systems, execute this shell command:
   % sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow dash
   Install as /bin/sh? No
Please refer to the Getting Started guide for more information,
or contact CodeSourcery Support for assistance.
tim at servo:~/Downloads$

Do I want to touch this?  Is this going to screw up _other_ software 
that may be looking for 'sh' to be a Dash shell command?  Or am I fairly 
safe playing with it?

And do I want to just change the link manually, or do I want to use 
dpgk-reconfigure as they suggest?

Ooooh, I'm soooo confused.  This is violating my implicit contract with 
Ubuntu "Good training wheels" Linux.

(I am, frankly, far more comfortable with the idea of doing my own 
build, if only there were _real_ source available.  Grr.  Grump.)

Ubuntu's mission statement is embodied in bug #1 in their Bugzilla: 
"Microsoft Windows has too much market share".  I hope they stick to 
that attitude.  There are plenty of "Linux Wonk" distros out there -- I 
like Ubuntu's "Linux with (removable) training wheels" approach, and 
since I intend to remain a guy who works _with_ computers, rather than a 
guy who works _on_ computers I want Ubuntu to stay true to that philosophy.

Tim,

I don't have any empirical evidence of what might befall you, but found 
these docs on google:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh

And the wikipedia page had some helpful mentions of issues when Ubuntu 
went to dash in 6.1:

Debian actually uses bash for /bin/sh by default.  I personally always
change this to dash.  /bin/sh is supposed to be a POSIX compliant
shell, but bash always supports non-compliant syntax which causes some
coders to write shell scripts with "bashisms" that aren't portable.  

Also, bash is a memory hog like no other.  As DJB once said: "There
are good interfaces and then there are user interfaces".  Bash is
definitely a user interface.  So dash is both faster and keeps you
honest by being POSIX compliant and restricting you to POSIX compliant
syntax.

The fact that this company requires /bin/sh to be bash means that
they're writing bash scripts and sticking "#!/bin/sh" in the header
instead of "#!/bin/bash".  A simple bug to fix on their end, but for
some reason they expect users to change they way they operate to
accommodate them.

Summary:  That's really annoying, but it probably won't break anything
to switch to bash, besides making your shell scripts run slower.

I'm thinking that I'll just change the link, install the software, try 
it out, then change the link back -- in hopes that the only scripts that 
cause problems are in their install.

Damn but I wish I could find their source code.  "Open source" indeed.

I would advise changing the link in the way they describe with
dpkg-reconfigure.

I'm guessing you'll find that their software would have shell scripts
floating around with "#!/bin/sh" headers.  You could also stick with
dash and just change all of their shell scripts to use bash.

Good luck,

Hmm.  Maybe.  I don't know how many scripts I'd find -- the software is 
basically the gnu toolchain for C development, cross-compiled for the ARM.

This isn't going to help you much, but when I was screwing around with
this last autumn, I just built crosstools from the bog-standard source
tarballs.  I found instructions for building the cross-tools without
too much trouble, but I don't remember exactly where now.  I don't
recall that I actually confirmed that the crosstools worked (except to
use them to disassemble some firmware).  So, don't despair.  I think
generally you aren't finding "their" source code because they are just
using the standard gcc/binutils toolchain source.

Maybe someone who knows better will straighten me/us out.

I think if you just do dpkg-reconfigure on dash again (same command
they describe), it'll prompt you again for the same choice of whether
or not to use it as /bin/sh.

It could be that the Makefiles they use implicitly shell out and
they've got bashisms in there.  That might make it a little harder to
fix.  Some environment variable or make config could overcome that.
Just speculation...

I will give it a try.  I'm not good at memorizing lots of odd keystroke 
combinations, so I vastly prefer Insight to GDB.  I've heard stories 
that the official 'newlib' has arm-related bugs -- but I'll just give it 
a whirl and see.

FWIW, OpenEmbedded and Poky also require this change. I believe it is 
done because they support building thousands of packages, and there are 
many of them out there that expect /bin/sh to support bash extensions.

I have not yet run into any cases yet where a shell script breaks 
because /bin/sh is bash instead of dash.

Definitely use dpkg-reconfigure. This will ensure that package updates 
don't end up reverting the change.

Workstation 7.0 on Fedora 12 works perfectly for me without any sort
of modification or patching. The included Player 3.0 still suffers
from glitch, though. I've found that Workstation works well with
Fedora as long as the Workstation release date is after the Fedora
release date.

Subject: [PLUG] pmap output
Message-ID: <4BD9DB6B.9080300@robertmarktech.com>

All,

I'm checking the memory (Centos 5.4) usage on a process and pmap is 
reporting 0k used. However, ps -aux | grep igateway shows me the following:

[autosys at autosys02 iTechnology]$ ps aux | grep igateway
root       867  3.6  1.7 1122984 17980 ?       Ssl  Apr22 344:41 
./igateway -b
root       888  0.0  0.1   4624  1196 pts/2    S    Apr22   3:18 /bin/sh 
./WDigateway.sh
autosys   6494  0.0  0.0   4000   728 pts/3    R+   11:40   0:00 grep 
igateway

I understand that ps shows the memory of all shared libraries, but it 
seems odd that the process itself wouldn't have any output with pmap. Is 
there something I'm missing about how pmap works?

thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] smartmontools test accuracy?
Message-ID: <4BD9F358.1010502@zenlinux.com>

I have a server with a SATA drive in it which is filling the syslogs 
with the following error:

[455740.180143] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] Add. Sense: ATA pass through 
information available
[457540.199345] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] Sense Key : Recovered Error [current] 
[descriptor]
[457540.199360] Descriptor sense data with sense descriptors (in hex):
[457540.199367]         72 01 00 1d 00 00 00 0e 09 0c 00 00 00 00 00 00
[457540.199384]         00 4f 00 c2 40 50

smartctl -a shows some enormous values for the following parameters:

Raw_Read_Error_Rate: 179400719
Seek_Error_Rate: 7232305
Hardware_ECC_Recovered: 179400719

However, I have just run the short and long tests from smartmontools and 
they both passed without errors.

So yes, I'm going to replace the drive immediately. But it surprised me 
that the SMART tests would pass. I'm curious if anyone else has run into 
this, and why it is the case?

I started downloading from cat.pdx.edu, but it was too slow. So I
switched to osu.osl, but that wasn't any faster. Then I tried the
torrents, which screamed. I currently have all the Ubuntus - alternate,
desktop, server, netbook, both 32- and 64-bit. I just started on the
Kubuntus and will have them all in an hour and a half. Then I'll get
the Edubuntu and Mythbuntu and the rest.

I will continue seeding for a couple of days. Since I am local I should
be able to feed pretty quickly in case someone wants to torrent one of
the new Ubuntus.

A quick follow up to my own post.

Looks like gvfs and gnome-vfs are not what I need.  Gnome-vfs on CentOS 
is *broken* in that it doesn't work with OOo when using a sftp 
connection.  That works OK with Fedora 12.

The biggest problem is gvfs doesn't present a non-GUI based "mount 
point" (?).  It is hidden down in a ~.gvfs directory.  So non-Gnome (and 
even some Gnome) programs can't find or get access to the directory.

I'm current re-allocating some tuits to figuring out how to get sshfs 
(FUSE based) to work from Gnome.  There is the afuse (auto-mount for 
FUSE) package but it appears to need to be run once for each mount.  A 
bunch of fun if you need 15-20 connections.  A play-well-with-others/ 
enhanceable version of gvfs would be best.  (Not sure I'm up to that 
level of hacking.  8-( )

So in the mean time I have created a bunch of mount points on my 
desktop, open a terminal window, and mount/unmount them as needed.

Torrents are definitely the way to go when a new version is released.  The
mirrors always go dog slow for the first few days, even simple updates are
painful.  Thanks for seeding, it helps everyone.

I ran the torrents yesterday and it took only 25 min to install the live CD.

10.04 is running great! Ubuntu's getting better all the time. :)

FWIW, i snagged an iso last night at about midnight from osuosl with
wget and it took about 15 minutes and I got my full 7Mbps pretty much

10.4 is feeling great in a clean install on a brand-new machine (timed 
perfectly for a new box from my employer).

Is that a Seagate drive, by any chance?  I have a Seagate FreeAgent Go
USB drive that has similar behavior.  Nothing shows up
in /var/log/messages, but both  smartctl -a  and Palimpsest show huge
numbers for raw read error, seek, and hardware ECC correction rates.
Yet both programs give the drive a healthy status.  For the record,
here's some of the output of  smartctl -a :

(Sorry for the long lines, that's what smartctl outputs.)

Since the drive is backed up, and not really vital (it's got my music

puzzled as to why it isn't flagged as dying, though.

It is in fact a Seagate. The story got even more interesting when I 
noticed the following was in my smartctl -a output:

==> WARNING: There are known problems with these drives,
see the following Seagate web pages:
http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/selfservice/search.jsp?DocId=207931
http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/selfservice/search.jsp?DocId=207963

That second URL points to a KB article mentioning a critical firmware 
update. You might want to check Seagate's web site in case your drive 
also has "known problems."

I have no idea if updating the firmware on the drive would make it work 
without errors...at this point there's no way I can trust it. It's 
needed for an important  build server, so I won't be taking any chances.

The raw value is just a count of the times things needed to be
recovered.  It is of not processed.
The more you use a drive the larger these numbers will get as there
are always recoverable errors.

On each of the Attributes if it is Pre-fail and the Value item gets to
the thresh (it's count down) then
the drive is a smart failure.  If it get to this value in the warranty
period then you can get it replaced.

Smart is designed  to provide predicative failure such that you can
still recover your data before
it totally fails.  It mostly works for things that degrade like
head/disk interfaces.   It doesn't do anything
for catastrophic failures that don't show degrading trends in
performance or that drop to the floor.

Ah, I had either missed or forgotten that the values were count DOWN.
Thank you for that tidbit!  That really sets my mind at ease about my
drive.  (It's a nice drive, btw.  Lots of storage space, physically
thin -- it fits in my shirt pocket -- and powered directly from the
USB.)

Oh, that part I knew.  No way is the program going to detect that
someone dropped a drive from six feet to a concrete floor before
installing it.  :-)  Or plugged the power cable in upside down.  (Think
it couldn't be done?  Think again.  Some folks are _very_ stubborn.)

I failed to keep my promise to seed. That is, I left Vuze running all
night, but when I got up this morning it had crashed sometime in the
middle of the night. I started it up again before leaving this morning
for PSU, but when I got home at 2 pm it had crashed again.

I tried Azureus/Vuze several times over the years and always went back
to something else because it was so unstable. Looks like I'll be
shopping for a bittorrent client again.

It took only 5-10 minutes per version to download each one, so at least
I have them all on my hard disk.

   I'm a couple of hours into upgrading my wife's xubuntu laptop. We have a
fairly slow DSL line, but that's OK because it can sit there and do its
thing for several hours without interferring with other use of the network.

I've been using Transmission and seeding since you sent your email out 
without problems. Of course I only have space for the desktops on my 
drive at the moment...

Yes, OSUOSL's network was pegged for only the first 3 hours after
the 10.04 release, they have plenty of bandwidth now:

Given that you are seeing errors in your syslog, I wouldn't take any
chances either.  Once it's replaced, you can fiddle with it at your
leisure, and not put your server at risk.  You may find that the drive
is okay (see Larry Brigman's post regarding SMART's output), but it
might not be, too.  In my case, the drive looks like it should be
fine.  I will check Seagate's website to see if there are any firmware
updates, though.
