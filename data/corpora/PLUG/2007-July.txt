Subject: [PLUG] Syslog Stops: Why?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0707011330490.8431@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Twice within 9 days I've had syslog stop. No indication that it was ill,
wanted time off, or anything else. The indication was no log files mailed to
me (e.g., the pflogsumm of /var/log/maillog) because nothing was being
logged to them.

   Google shows folks in the past (e.g., 6 or so years ago) having problems,
but nothing I saw looked applicable to me.

   Any ideas from you folks who professionally manage systems?

      I don't have a very good description of this presentation yet; but
      Sybase is an old well established Relational Data Base Management
      System using the SQL language - much like mySQL, postgres, Oracle,
      Informix, DB2, and Microsoft SQL Server.  Sybase predates most of
      these.  In fact, I think Sybase created Microsoft SQL Server for
      Microsoft.
      In any case, Sybase is a very stable high preformance data base
      widely used for mission critical applications in the health care
      and financial services industries.
      I'm not sure when Sybase became available on Linux, but "since
      its free promotion in September 2004, there have been over 30,000
      Sybase ASE Express Edition for Linux downloads from sybase.com."
      I believe Sybase is now Open Source, but I can't find anything
      on this on sybase.com so this may be wrong.
      I'm sure Brad will let us know for sure.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux printer info
Message-ID: <20070701173956.d4b7c613.johnxj@comcast.net>

I am printing a book pro bono about a severely endangered African
language (only a dozen speakers left), and I need a small number of
color covers (<500). The image area for the covers is 9 by 11.5 inches,
and the stock must be heavy, so a typical desktop color printer won't
do. I also sometimes would like to print covers with an image area of
11.5 by 18 inches. The problem is that I don't need to do this all the
time. In other words, the printer will be used to print 500 or 1,000
copies of a cover, then turned off and not used for several months.
Because of this I have decided I must have a laser; inkjets would be
constantly clogging.

Natually, there have to be full-featured Linux drivers. Now, we've all
been there - the manufacturer says "why of course we have Linux drivers
for our Paper-Blaster Mark IV laser printer." You buy the printer and
then discover that the Linux drivers will not access several of the
features that you specifically bought the printer for. You spit,
grumble and gripe, and then end up selling the printer on eBay.

So I'm trying to find a web site that has printer information for
Linux. I found openprinting.org, but they do not list very many
printers. For example, I already discovered the Xerox Phaser 7400DN
that appears to have the features I need (and I can get a refurb for
$2K), and Xerox says they support several Linux distros. But the 7400DN
is not listed in openprinting.org's database. Plus, you can't access
the database except by searching by manufacturer and printer model - it
would be a lot easier if I could fill out a page with my requirements
and get a list of possibilities.

Shopping for a printer should not be this hard. Does anyone know of a
good place to find Linux printer info? Or does anyone have personal
knowledge of a color laser that will print large size sheets of cover
stock?

   It appears that linuxprinting.org has morphed into openprinting.org. The
former site had a huge database of printers which listed the drivers, the
degree to which the printer would work under linux, and a host of other
useful information.

   For what you want to do, consider a local commercial printer. I've been
using Prestige Printing in Gresham for more than a decade, and I recommend
them without reservation. In addition to printing my business cards, checks,
and deposit tickets, I take (or e-mail) them pdf files of color documents
and they set it up and run them off on their color laser printer for a very
reasonable price. IIRC, I paid about $40 for 100 copies the last time.
They'll be printing our OMR scan cards, with microperf along the inside
edge, because the data boxes must be printed in red so the reader doesn't
confuse an empty box for a marked one. They also have offset presses and do
other types of printing.

   For incidental work such as what you and I need, there are several
advantages to using a commercial printer. They pay for and maintain their
color laser printers, and they use them regularly so they are ready for use
all the time. They have color-matched monitors so what you see on the
monitor is what will come out of the printer. They have a large selection of
paper in various weights, colors, finishes, and sizes. The folks with whom I
do business are small businesses, too, and they take care of their
customers.

   You'll save money, time, and aggrevation and get a better quality product
while you do something else.

The latter appears to be largely the same, just wrapped in new CSS.

http://openprinting.org/printer_list.cgi appears to have everything
linuxprinting.org had.

That's the site that does not list the Xerox Phaser 7400DN. Xerox specs
on it say they support several Linux distros, but even if they did not,
it is reasonably popular and should at least be listed.

I have used commercial printers for my book covers for quite a few
years, and I know the advantages and disadvantages. I will still use
commercial printers for most of my work. But when you need just a few
covers the cost per cover on a press is outrageous. The problem is
makeready. Even on state of the art computerized presses it is not cost
effective until you get at least a thousand copies. 

There is also a horrendous amount of waste. I have sent probably
$20,000 of printing to the recycler because I ordered too many covers
and they became out of date before I used up them up. That will buy a
lot of laser printers and toner.

There is also the matter of control. If I own the printer and it is
right here next to me I can have copies in minutes. If there is
something wrong with my artwork I can fix it and reprint right away. I
recently had 2,000 covers for each of two of my books reprinted. This
was just reprints, yet it took three trips from my place out to
Beaverton, at least a dozen phone calls, and nearly a week before I
took delivery of the covers. Why did it take so much effort? Because I
had to verify that they had the correct image, because I had to verify
that they had not cropped or altered the size (which their software
does automatically unless they remember to check the box not to),
because I had to approve the ink color, because the laminator called
and said the paper they were going to use was not compatible with the
lay-flat nylon he needed to use, because the pressman called and wanted
to verify that I really needed the copies grain short, and I could go
on. You get really great, fast service if you're printing standard
stuff. Book covers are a different world.

So I still want to buy a large format color laser. :)

Subject: [PLUG] usb cd ripping faster (per each!) when parallelized
Message-ID: <200707020201.32370.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

Hi all,

I was curious about how well usb cdroms would scale when ripping CDs 
simultaneously.  Did a benchmark of three times each in parallel and 
series with three discs which were rotated through all of the drives, 
(extracting just the first track.)

It appears that the individual rips run at a higher speed when they are 
all running at once.  So, the parallelization scales at an efficiency 
of about 1.05!

I have more data (and code) if you're interested, but this is pretty 
unscientific, so just a summary here.  Drives are 0: unlabeled dvd rom, 
1: lite-on 52x, 2: plextor 48/12/10.  The "combined" number is the 
average of parallel and serial extraction.  All drives are in usb2 
cases plugged into the same usb2 hub.  CPU usage is about 3% per 
cdparanoia instance according to top.  Speeds are in "x" (seconds of 
audio extracted per wallclock second.)  These are the overall averages 
from 3 parallel and 3 serial runs with each of 3 disc rotations.

0:
  combined: 16.41x
  parallel: 16.49x
  serial:   16.33x
1:
  combined:  3.95x
  parallel:  4.03x
  serial:    3.87x
2:
  combined: 14.55x
  parallel: 14.96x
  serial:   14.14x

I can only conclude that the usb bus is bored or something.

Aside:  Note the abysmal 4x digital extraction rate on the "52x" drive.  
It is the only non-writer in the bunch.

Subject: [PLUG] flac audio library schemes?
Message-ID: <200707020214.42890.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

Hi all,

Any suggestions on what to use for an audio archiving scheme?  I would 
like to end up with the metadata in a database (read: not mysql) and 
would prefer a schema that might be usable by more than one program.

Has there been any effort to create a standard schema for this?

How about tools for automating the archiving (and maintenance) of an 
entire library?  I've used grip in the past, but I'm looking for 
something that is more easily automated.  Distributed encoding in 
flac/ogg/mp3 would be nice.  Perl libraries (good ones anyway) would be 
useful.

I could of course roll my own, but google tells me that's been done at 
least 15,000,000 times already.  Seems like one of them might gotten it 
right but I'm innundated with choices (most of which don't excite me.)

In particular, I would like to scan the barcodes of all of the discs to 
make a todo list so I don't miss any discs if they get shuffled during 
the process.  (The musicbrainz database would enable relations between 
cddb data and barcodes.)

Also note the part about 4 cdroms running simultaneously.

And then of course some way to listen to it all :-D

Thanks,
Eric

   For small runs the printer should use their color laser printer, not
letterpress or another setup. My experience with Prestige has been uniformly
positive, YMMV.

In my experience, those symptoms are due to the log files being 
rotated out from under syslogd and klogd. That is, the log files are 
rotated but syslogd doesn't receive a HUP, signaling that it should 
close its file descriptors and re-open files.

Paul,

   What might cause the behavior of the log file rotator to change? I've not
made any changes to the system for months. That's why I find this puzzling.

   When the logging stopped, I grep'd the process list for syslogd and it was
not there.

Thanks,

Rich

I don't have any strong suspicions. It could be lack of disk space. 
Perhaps it was a corrupted PID file. If syslogd is disappearing, you 
might try adding cron job that checks for its existence every few 
minutes:

    pgrep syslogd >/dev/null || echo no syslogd at $(date)

That will at least give you some hint as to when it's dying. If it 
dies regularly after, say, a logrotate run, then you can zero in on 
what's going wrong.

   Thanks, Paul. I'll do that. Plenty of disk space in all partitions. This
is all new. Happened the first time a week ago last Friday night (empty mail
log Saturday morning), and again this past Saturday night.

So drive down to Wilsonville and tell Xerox. I'm sure Till Kamppeter
would appreciate a bit of help keeping up with new models.

Having said that, most printers that do PostScript are just fine in Linux.

I asked a friend at Xerox about this.  Here's his response:

"The Phaser 7400DN is a PostScript printer, so it's completely
supported by every distro that includes CUPS.  All you need is the
"Postscript Printer Definition" (PPD) file, a text file that describes
paper sizes, trays, etc.  There's a bundle of PPD files (and other
stuff) on the Xerox support site at

I'll mention to the customer support jocks that somebody should update
openprinting.org."

I open the YaST Control Center and choose Software Management and then

If instead I click on Computer/Install Software, then I do see Tomcat
but if I click on Install, I get asked if I want to add myself as a

Thanks, but I could have guessed that would be the response. With
PostScript printers, it is always the answer to give Linux folks.
However, in my experience it is misleading.

The Xerox Phaser 7400DN is available refurbished from Wlsonville for
about $1,900, which is tempting. However, the problem is not the
PostScript and it's not the PPD file. The problem is CUPS. I have three
genuine Adobe PostScript printers here and I use the same PPD files on
my Linux computers as on my Windows computer. The Windows computer
recognizes every feature of the printer. CUPS recognizes most of the
features, but not all. CUPS is able to recognize only mainstrream
features. People say that the PPD file is a text file, and that is
true, but I have read PPD files and I can tell you that they are text
files in the same way that a script is a text file. That is, the PPD
file is filled with code and each line must be written in a manner that
has all the words and punctuation exactly correct. If CUPS sees a term
it does not know, it just ignores it, or at least, that's what appears
to be why I cannot access some of the features of the printer on Linux
even though I am using exactly the same PPD file as on Windows.

What worries me about the Phaser 7400 DN is that it supposedly (from
the published specs) can print on stock 12 x 18 inch, up to 80 lb
cover / 216 gsm. What if it jams constantly unless you tell the driver
that the stock is cover, and CUPS doesn't recognize the option? What if
CUPS doesn't even know about that paper size? Somewhere, deep inside
its little bit-brain, CUPS has to know what to do with a feature. The
more esoteric the feature, the more likely it will not be available
when printing from Linux.

There is also the matter of bugs. On two of my printers it is
impossible to print landscape duplexed because the "tumble on short
edge" feature doesn't work. The back side always prints upside down.
The only way I can get output from these printers that is landscape
duplexed on the short side is to save to PDF and then print with an lp
command.

Printing to high featured printers is horribly complex. The number of
features that the driver (read: programmer) has to juggle is
staggering. I'm constantly astonished that any of it works at all.
Therefore, before I buy a printer I want to communicate with a genuine
Linux user who has said printer and can verify that the specific
features I'm buying the printer for actually work.

And speaking of complex issues, even shopping for a printer is a PITA.
I haven't bought a new printer for several years, so I just assumed
there would be a web site which functions as a front end to query a
relational database containing all features of all known printers. Hah!
I have to scour every manufacturer's website and painstakingly read
every description looking for the features I need. So far I haven't
even finished narrowing the options down, let alone reading reviews and
checking out Linux compatibility. <sigh>

Subject: [PLUG] Anyone Fluent In udev?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0707031504570.17539@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've been going around in circles the past couple of weeks trying to get
my new Treo 700p to sync with the desktop. Neither the 'visor' module nor
libusb is working for the task, although the former will unpredictably
provide a single connection.

   With 'visor' loaded, there are /dev/tts/USB0 and /dev/tts/USB1. Once in a
great while, I can connect the USB sync cable to the PDA, click the button,
wait a couple of seconds, then invoke the command, 'pilot-xfer -p
/dev/tts/USB1 -l.' Infrequently, it works, and the connection is
established. Most of the time I see 'listening for a connection on
/dev/tts/USB1 ...', and that's all.

   /var/log/messages shows the PDA on ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1.

   Removing the visor module, and having installed libusb, I try the same
thing, but specify the port as 'pilot-xfer -p usb: -l' and have not been
able to succesfully connect to the PDA.

   In this case, /var/log/messages show this when I plug in the cable to the
PDA:

Jul  3 15:12:06 salmo kernel: usb 2-4: new full speed USB device using
ohci_hcd and address 53
Jul  3 15:12:06 salmo kernel: usb 2-4: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice

   There is no udev logging anywhere, even though I have logging enabled in
/etc/udev/udev.conf.

   This is on Slackware-11.0 with the 2.6.19.2 kernel, pilot-link-0.12.2,
libusb-0.1.12, and udev-071. So far, no one on the jpilot or pilot-link mail
lists have mentioned a working solution.

I'm dated in my RS-232C knowledge and have only begun using a laptop 4 years 
ago. I've never had any serial ports on either of my laptops so I could take 
a voltage measurement but I assumed it was 12 volts like it was years ago..  
I've been modem free for 7 1/2 years now so I don't have any use for serial 
ports anymore.

I do have an old Palm Pilot V that I still use and I did have to buy a USB to 
DB9 cable to use KPilot. Linux recognized the USB Serial port as soon as I 
plugged it in. I also use it for my GPS as well and can use "gpsdrive" with 
it.

openSUSE 10.2 includes Tomcat.  I think that "zmd" is hosed up or not 
configured correctly. You can try the instructions on this web page to 
disable "zmd", and remove the RPMs, and go with a YaST or Zypper 
configuration instead.

http://opensuse-community.org/Package_Sources/10.2

I installed openSUSE 10.2 from a DVD and there are a number of Tomcat packages 
available on it. I haven't tried these instructions yet but I've given up on 
"zmd" since it's not able to update anything anymore since it appears to have 
a corrupted configuration or something. I just to the SUSE updater applet in 
KDE instead and it checks for updatesfor me and lists out what updates are 
available for my system based on my installed packages.

I'll give these instructions a try when I get a chance since I don't want 
"zmd" to startup anymore on my system since it doesn't work. From an openSUSE 
standpoint I believe they've dropped "zmd" in 10.3 since it's really geared 
for Enterprise users which would be SLES or SLED.

Sure enough, if I short RXD to GND it shows about 3.5V open-circuit 
between GND and TXD/RTS/DTR.  It's only enough power to flip these 
little reed relays without an led.

I'm not seeing any adverse affects, so maybe the isolation is optional 
in this case?  I'm sure ground loops could impact the signal integrity 
at high data speeds, but this is a very primitive device.

I'll look at a non-jumpered setup.  A transistor and solid state relay?

Thanks,

Rich,
I know this is the big hammer approach but Slackware 12 was just released on
Monday. I've been keeping tabs on the changelog and there has been a lot of
udev goodness that has been changed up. I am going to upload the DVD ISO I
got via Bit Torrent -  which was horribly slow because its not being seeded
well yet - to my server in PDX tonight if you want to grab it.

Tony, I was able to get Tomcat installed thru YaST by 
opening up the YaST Control Center, clicking on 
Installation Source dropping down the Source list in the lower right and
ensuring that all sources are enabled. I had one that said "Off" When I
did this Tomcat appeared in my list of packages and I installed it and
it is so far working.

I've been spending a lot of time with Ubuntu and Suse is similar but
different enough to cause me some confusion. I'm easy about what distro
I use, but I've noticed that some people are very religious about it.

Thanks for the warning about zmd.

As far as RS-232 goes, I've observed most devices output +/- 10V. I believe 
the spec calls for a minimum swing of +/- 7V, but I could be wrong. The spec 
is from days when RS-232 lines were run hundreds (thousands?) of feet long 
and needed a large differential to overcome noise, etc. I have observed many 
UARTs these days are tolerant of 0-5V because laptops tend to generate these 
voltage levels. Although I don't think this is technically called RS-232 
anymore because it doesn't fit the spec.

Also I believe the spec calls for a ground connection between the devices, 
relative to the signals on the line. (meaning this need not be a system 
ground). So connecting the ground on a USB adapter's RS-232 side to the 
ground on the USB side could cause it problems, if the spec works how I think 
it does.

If you have a device (like a USB serial adapter) generating 0-5V, you can 
build a simple circuit to drive those voltages to "proper" RS-232 levels with 
free samples of Maxim Semiconductor's MAX233A which doesn't even require 
capacitors for the charge pump.

Subject: [PLUG] Suse and the jsch jar with ant
Message-ID: <1183539794.25468.16.camel@halibut>

I'm using the optional scp task in Ant to deploy some zips and it's
failing because it wants the jsch jar.

I'm using Suse 10.2. On Ubuntu it was pretty obvious where to put this
jar but on Suse I've tried a couple of places and it still isn't
recognized. Does anyone have any advice on where to put it? I
tried /usr/share/ant/lib but that was
wrong.

Note that on Suse, I used YaST to load and configure Apache, MySQL, Ant,
and Tomcat. The error message I get talks about rebuilding Ant (I don't
want to do this and should not have to). On Ubuntu I placed the jar
in /opt/apache-ant-1.7.0/lib and all was well. I installed ant not
through Ubuntu's Synaptic Package Manager but as a download from the ant
site, but on Suse I wanted to stick with YaST.

I think the solution is as simple as getting the jsch jar in the right
place, but would appreciate knowing if I'm wrong. Thanks.

Can you post the exact error message?

Just firing blindly into the dark here, but what CLASSPATH is set/used by 
your ant files?

Drew,

   Thanks for the offer. I'm on Pat's subscription list and will be getting
my box of cdrom disks Real Soon Now. (I see the price has increased 33%;
must be more than 6 disks in the new release.) I've not yet read the change
log, but I did read the release announcement. I hope the upgrade is not as
painful ad the 10.2->11.0 was. That one required me to install _everything_,
then spend a couple of hours removing all the cruft I don't use, rather than
just upgrading what I do use.

Rich

Message-ID: <1183566592.7419.13.camel@halibut>

David,
Thanks for responding. I feel pretty much alone in the woods here.

It's the standard error message that I see everyone else getting when I
search the net (It's long ... I'll paste it at the end). 

The standard solution appears to be to get jsch-0.1.33.jar and place it
in what they say is the ant lib or the ant classpath. And it's this last
task I'm stuck on. Under Ubuntu I just added the jar
to /opt/apache-ant-1.7.0/lib and then it worked. Under Suse I do not
know where to put it. I tried putting it in my own directory and using
the -lib option for ant but that still gave me the error. I tried
putting it in /usr/share/ant/lib; that did not work.

BTW scp works fine outside of ant; my difficulty is with the <scp/> ant
task itself.

Here is the error message
===start===
This is common and has a number of causes; the usual
solutions are to read the manual pages then download and
install needed JAR files, or fix the build file:
 - You have misspelt 'scp'. <== No, it's spelled correctly. ==>
   Fix: check your spelling.
 - The task needs an external JAR file to execute <== this was the
problem with Ubuntu. It needed jsch-0.1.33.jar ==>
     and this is not found at the right place in the classpath.
   Fix: check the documentation for dependencies. <== I did ant the
dependency was jsch
   Fix: declare the task. <== with a taskdef? what do I use for
classpath? ==>
 - The task is an Ant optional task and the JAR file and/or libraries
     implementing the functionality were not found at the time you
     yourself built your installation of Ant from the Ant sources. <== I
didn't build ... got ant from YaST. ==>
   Fix: Look in the ANT_HOME/lib for the 'ant-' JAR corresponding to the
     task and make sure it contains more than merely a
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF.
     If all it contains is the manifest, then rebuild Ant with the
needed
     libraries present in ${ant.home}/lib/optional/ , or alternatively,
     download a pre-built release version from apache.org
- The build file was written for a later version of Ant
   Fix: upgrade to at least the latest release version of Ant
 - The task is not an Ant core or optional task
     and needs to be declared using <taskdef>.
 - You are attempting to use a task defined using
    <presetdef> or <macrodef> but have spelt wrong or not
   defined it at the point of use

Remember that for JAR files to be visible to Ant tasks implemented
in ANT_HOME/lib, the files must be in the same directory or on the
classpath

Please neither file bug reports on this problem, nor email the
Ant mailing lists, until all of these causes have been explored,
as this is not an Ant bug.

Message-ID: <468BDD43.3090605@alcpress.com>

My company is expanding the size of our colocation
rack to make room for another computer. As the size
of the rackspace increases, the cost goes down. It
occurred to me that others may be interested in
sharing rackspace to reduce their costs or to
improve reliability. We've never had measurable,
unscheduled downtime. In fact, I don't recall
any downtime - scheduled or otherwise - in 3 years.

One of my motives for wanting to share rack space
is to have the rack assigned a /24 netblock so we
can control our own reverse DNS.

If you want to discuss this, please contact me
at 503-635-6370

   It's all working now, with the visor module rather than libusb. Must have
been a Computer Thing, and it finally tired of playing with us so it quite
fighting and just began working.

   All's well now.

OK, I'm serious this time.

I'm looking for a laptop to replace my desktop machine.  Mild video 
processing is probably the most intensive activity I would like to 
continue doing.

I also would like to make sure I have a DVI output so that I can dock it 
with my fancy 22" widescreen LCD when I'm home.

Of course, I would like to minimize size/cost as much as is reasonable.

Recommendations?  Warnings?

Thanks.

	Lists' Manager
Message-ID: <200707041355.10747.alex@daniloff.com>

Hello Linux folkz,

I'm trying to find a practical solution to setup private and secure Mail 
Server & Mailing Lists' Manager with the following characteristics:

1. Mail Server shall generate separate and unique public encryption key for 
the each Mailing List it handles.

2. Mail Server shall distribute Mailing List relevant public encryption key 
and newly generated unique private encryption key to the each new subscriber.
As an option the subscriber shall be able to upload its own generated private
encryption key to the Mail Server.

3. Mail Server shall store private encryption key associated with the each 
subscriber in SQL database along with subscribers' email address and 
subscription information.

4. When the Mail Server receives a message encrypted with subscriber's private 
key, it decrypts it using existing subscriber's private key stored in SQL 
database. Then the Mail Server encrypts this message with the Mailing List 
public encryption key and distributes it to all other Mailing List 
subscribers.

5. If the subscriber has a mail account on the Mail Server, the subscriber 
shall be able to retrieve its mail using ether POP3S or IMAPS protocols.

Could you please point me out if there any Mailing List Manager software which 
could handle these tasks.

Thank you in advance,

Alex

Not sure what you mean by "dock" the way you reference the term.  If you 
only want to connect to a monitor, then any laptop with DVI-out should 
work for your needs.  If you want to have a docking station to hook up 
several peripherals, then not all laptops have this ability.  I 
recommend a Dell Latitude.  They are essentially a less pretty Inspiron 
with a dock port on the bottom.

I don't need any fancy docking station.  I'm just going to keep a USB 
keyboard and trackball near my big monitor on my desk to use in my home 
office.

Of course any laptop with DVI-out should work... but I want it to be 
reasonably fast at 1680x1050.  I put someone's old Powerbook on this 
monitor and the screen update was crappy.

Ideally, I will use the thing in dual-monitor mode on my desk with the 
laptop in one of those upright book-holders.

A dock port's not that necessary for my needs.  And I talked to a Dell guy 
yesterday who said that Dell offers no DVI outputs on anything smaller 
than 17" laptop.  I would like to avoid something that large.

Did you install all of the "ant" packages that showed up when you searched in 
the "Software Magement" dialog in YaST? I know that the basic "ant" RPM was 
installed but none of the external tasks were installed for me by default.

My recommendations are dependent on what you want to run on it. If you
want to run MacOS, get a Macintosh laptop. That will allow you to also
run Windows and/or Linux with Parallels. They say you can dual/triple
boot an Intel Mac, but from what I understand, the performance of
Parallels is so good you may not have to. And most of the interesting
open source software will run on MacOS. :)

If you don't want to run MacOS, but *do* want to run Windows, then most
of the recent ones that aren't Vista-ready will also do a good job with
at least one version of Linux, either dual-booted or under VMware Server
(the free one). The Linux drivers, etc., haven't quite caught up with
the *really new* Vista-ready ones, so if you can get an older one with
all the goodies you want, that's the way to go. They're also less expensive.

Finally, if you *only* want to run Linux, you've got two options:

1. Buy one with Linux pre-loaded from some vendor. There are a number of
them out there, including (I think) Dell, but I can't vouch for any of them.

2. Buy one with Windows installed and nuke Windows. I don't really
recommend nuking Windows -- if you've got a big enough hard drive, you
can bring Windows up once, remove all the crapware, subscribe to the
virus protection service, etc. Then you can cut the Windows partition
down to the bare minimum and dual-boot the machine with your favorite Linux.

That way you'll have a fallback if you're on the road and can't get your
wi-fi to work or have to sign on once with Windows/Internet Explorer in
the hotel to satisfy the local gods of Internet connectivity. I've lost
track of how many times I've had to fall back to my Windows partition on
my laptop when I'm on the road. And I can't remember a time when I
*didn't* crash the hotel's Internet (wired *and* wireless) with Linux
and have to bring up Windows to talk the service tech through the issues
and get the hotel back on the air. :)

One other note: you'll probably find that AMD laptops are a good bit
less expensive than Intel ones. I gave away my last Intel system, a P3,
and now am 100 percent AMD. All of them run Linux well and about the
only thing they won't do is run MacOS. :)

After considerable googling it appears that the best deal for me is a
Konica-Minolta-QMS Magicolor 7450. (Pick a company name, they seem to
use all three.) However, it is not listed in openprinting.org. All I
have to go on is that the vendor lists a couple Linux distros as
"supported." Has anyone herre by any chance used one of these? Does
anyone know of any Linux printing blogs, wikis or review sites?

I used IE4Linux to install IE under Wine, and it works flawlessly. So I
have no Windows partition. Just a thought...

I too am shopping for a laptop, and I'm mostly focused on the T61, but
I'm still open to anything that isn't insanely heavy and on which
everything works with Linux (suspend/resume, wireless, video fully
supported, etc.). The HP dv-series is on my radar, and Dell isn't
completely off the radar. I expect to spend under $1600, which is about
$1k less than a comparable Mac (including the software I'd have to buy
to have the full Mac experience). 

Jeme, is this a reasonable price? It's near the mode for laptop prices,
but above the median.

I'd recommend a Thinkpad, which is what I bought and with Ubuntu anyway
all the important stuff just works, I was careful to get the Intel
Graphics and I got the intel ABG wifi card, though the other option
might have worked as well.

It's one button to get your machine and go vs. mouse, keyboard, monitor, 
and power adapter.  It has nothing to do with "fancy", it's just 
convenient.  If you've never had one it will take you about 3 or 4 times 
using it to love it.

Dual monitor with your laptop folded up in a book holder?  Doesn't that 
just leave one monitor viewable?  How is that dual?

The Macbook's have a mini-DVI port, and they are smaller than 17", and 
they don't even offer a dock.  Any new laptop will push 1680x1050 ok.

It's not just IE -- it's the whole thing about hotels and their network
geeks not expecting or knowing how to deal with Linux. A typical scenario:

1. I check into a hotel. They have a different wireless setup from any
I've prepared for. And they don't have wired any more. So I boot up my
laptop in Linux and find it doesn't have drivers that I need. And if it
does, I bring up Firefox or Seamonkey and find that the damn network
*must* use Internet Explorer to validate me. It might work with Safari,
but I don't have that.

2. So, I reboot to Windows, validate myself, and download the drivers I
need. I save them off to the FAT32 partition that both Windows and Linux
can see, and boot back up into Linux.

3. I install the drivers, and discover that even with the drivers,
there's something that doesn't quite work. So I go downstairs to the
front desk and ask them if they have a wireless bridge. If they do, I
check it out, take it back up to the room, plug it into the Ethernet
jack on my laptop, and connect. If they don't, I'm screwed until I fix
the Linux stuff. In that case -- back to Windows, off to Google.

4. OK ... now I'm on the air with wireless and Linux, either having
solved my connectivity problem in Linux or having gotten a wireless
bridge. Now I start doing the stuff I normally do. Eventually, I crash
the hotel's network. I don't know why, but I haven't stayed in a hotel
yet that didn't crash at some time or another when I was using Linux.
Maybe it's Gentoo and its rsync for updates, maybe it's something funky
in the DHCP process -- eventually it "just doesn't work".

5. I call the 800 number for the network service. I go through the
mandatory sequence, *all* of which *only* works with Windows. If you
tell these guys, "DHCP isn't getting an IP address" or "everything works
except rsync" they respond with, "Please follow my instructions exactly
or I will be unable to help you."

6. After the front-line guy has tried all of his tricks and determined
what I already know -- that I crashed their router or routed their
crasher or sank their rsync or paroxysm'd their proxy server or DH'd
their CP -- he tells me that he has to bring in someone else.

7. 15 minutes to an hour later I get a call back from somebody who knows
how to admin the network gear. He tells me he has to reboot something.
He does. The laptop now comes back up -- in Windows. I have no idea how
many other people in the hotel were down while he rebooted. I now go
back to Linux and don't do again what I did that crashed their network.

What I'm saying is that I bought this laptop with Windows on it. I don't
mind stripping that down to the bare-assed minimum -- Windows and a
virus scanner -- but I am *not* going to delete something I paid for and
something that "usually works in a hotel room". If there's some vendor
out there who will sell me a Linux-only laptop, I'll certainly consider
it carefully. Now that I have my own wireless bridge, of course. :)

But to be perfectly frank, I'm not really interested in getting another
laptop until the Compaq Presario 2110US that I have now is broken beyond
all use. I don't travel all that much and don't code in coffee shops.
It's fast enough for anything I'd do on the road, runs Gentoo Linux just
fine, and is awesome at crashing hotel networking gear. :) And when it
finally does become unusable, most likely I'll buy the least expensive
Mac laptop, because I don't have any Macs.

I think there are Mac laptops under $1600US, although I haven't priced
them yet. As I noted above, that's my first choice for a next laptop but
I'm hoping that's at least a year out. I want Leopard stable and all the
software up to 64-bit dual-core standards before I plunk down cold cash
for a commercial OS and software. I don't mind spending my time
beta-testing open source, but I'm not gonna give *Apple* any of my QA or
marketing ergs. :)

I personally think anything over $700 is too much for a desktop base
model and anything over $1000 is too much for a laptop base model. Of
course, I don't mind having two computers, either. If you must have only
one computer, then by all means spend what you have to spend to get the
power you need.

Open the laptop to nearly 180 degrees, then place it on the book
holder. The laptop's display might sit an inch or so above the
adjacent monitor, but it basically works great (and it's a lot cheaper
than a purpose-built laptop stand).

Yes, I'm pretty sure I did. I know that by downloading ant from the ant
site and configuring it myself, I can get it to work. And so for the
time being that's what I'm going to do (I get a newer version of ant
(1.7) that way too BTW). My problem is not with ant or the OS I think
but rather with what happens when I install with YaST. And I may have
missed some package, although honestly I've been very careful to be
thorough. Getting a working ant from the ant site makes this problem not
a showstopper, and I can study it in non-critical moments.

Thanks for taking an interest in this. If it weren't for PLUG, I think
I'd be out in the wilderness.

Oh, a while back I complained about needing to put a password in an ant
file and not feeling comfortable with that. I read that people often use
use public/private key authentication with no passphrase for this
purpose (in that way your scripts contain no private information). Which
may be secure if the user who does the scp doesn't have rights to do
much else and you keep the private key in a very safe place. I think
this is the way to do secure automated uploads ... is this what people
do?

But since I'll have nothing to compare it against, I won't really notice

1)  I have no need for proprietary software and will not put it on my 
laptop.

2)  I tried using a final generation powerbook (before the macbook pro) 
And while it gave the right resolution, it was crappy and slow.  Full 
screen video was oogy at best.

3)  I have no interest in the added expense of the Mac brand.

The Thinkpads come very highly recommended.  I would probably give 
preference to a Thinkpad.  Basically, the smallest one with DVI would 
probably do me good.  I'll try to look into that.

Again, a Dell rep told me that their smallest laptop with DVI is a fairly 
bulky 17" affair.  It's practically a luggable.

I think I may be able to swing that much ($1600).  Keep me in the loop on

I don't have ant installed on my SuSE machine here, so my ability to help 
will be limited... but can you write a small ant script that echos out 
what ant thinks its classpath is?  Or even better, modifies your 
classpath to include the jsch jar file?  It's been a while since I used 
ant much, but I seem to recall setting the classpath in the environment 
(including all the jar files I needed) prior to running ant.

You can see what location an RPM installs the files into by performing the 
following (My example is the RPM from the 10.2 DVD and its ant package):

rpm -ql ant-1.6.5-41

That will show the path to each file in the RPM.

You can also run "ant -diagnostics" which dumps out a log of interesting 
information regarding ant's configuration. I would probably try copying your 
jsch.jar file to "/usr/share/ant/lib" since I see among other things the 
following entry when I run ant with the -diagnostics option:

ant.library.dir : /usr/share/ant/lib

That's what we do in cases where we connect to some systems via "SFTP". We 
have a key file installed on every system we need to connect to and so we can 
automate the upload of files in a script since we do not need to enter a 
password to connect to the remote hosts.

You might save money with a ThinkPad w/out DVI and a docking station that has DVI.

For all your ThinkPad goodnews see:

I just bought a T41 with 1GB RAM, 100MB HD, internal Wifi and immaculate screen
for $600.  I know this is $100 over my limit.  The particular vendor I bought
through does some refurbishing - like installing new hard drives.   Item

Anyone out there know of a way to manually blink link lights on ethernet
interfaces under Linux? I am working on a project where it would be useful
to be able to positively determine that a particular port on a computer
corresponds to a particular ethX device by saying "Eth0 is the one with the
blinking link light" and so on. I've been doing some man-page reading
(mii-tool and ifconfig) and Googling, but have so far come up empty handed.
A method that is easy to integrate into a Python or bash script would be
best, as if beggars can be choosers...

Isn't that always the way? Seconds after hitting send I remembered ethtool,
a quick look at the man page shows that it has this capability built right
in... Sorry!

Even though you both answered your own questions, thanks for posting.
That's a really neat feature.

To give an example:

$ sudo ethtool -p eth0 10

will blink the LEDs on eth0 ten times.

Subject: [PLUG] crazy postfix problem - fixed
Message-ID: <20070706205009.GA3185@gate.kl-ic.com>


I just spent a miserable 3 hours debugging an incoming mail problem.
If I actually fixed it, you will see this mail and so will I.

I have an offsite server which runs postfix.  It receives all my
incoming mail, and deals with some of it locally (mailing lists and
such) and routes the rest to my inside mail server for further
filtering and processing.

Sometime last night or this morning, mail stopped working, probably
due to rebooting all the machines while fixing an unrelated problem.
Most of the machines had been up for weeks or months.

The mail problem is our old friend, 
  "mail for mailserver.kl-ic.com loops back to myself"

(machine name changed to protect the innocent)

This is postfix's cryptic way of saying "go f**k yourself".  2.5 hours
were spent looking at postfix documents and configuration files (none
of which had changed in months) trying to figure out what went wrong.

Note that my outside DNS service is intentionally set up to route
requests to "mailserver.kl-ic.com" to the server.  That is so that
outbound email headers that leak out as "keithl at mailserver.kl-ic.com"
(instead of the rewritten "keithl at kl-ic.com") will get properly 
replied to.  

I turned out that the problem wasn't a postfix configuration problem
(unless you consider *postfix itself* a configuration problem).  It
turned out to be a DNS configuration problem on my firewall, which
uses named/BIND to do DNS for my inside machines and my outer server.  

My network of inside and outside machines are stitched together with
OpenVPN tunnels, all using 172.XXX.XXX.XXX addresses for the tunnel
segments.  On the outside machines, I could ping the inside network
machines, but "dig" would not provide ANSWER or AUTHORITY sections
for inside machines the way it does between inside machines.  After
checking iptables and firewalling, I eventually realized that the
nameserver on the firewall was not responding to the outside machine
DNS requests.  I fixed this by modifying /etc/named.conf, changing
the lines:

  view "internal" {
        match-clients { 192.168.XXX.0/24; 127.0.0.1; };

to: 
  view "internal" {
        match-clients { 192.168.XXX.0/24; 172.XXX.0.0/16; 127.0.0.1; };

( XXX = obscured in this posting for silly privacy reasons )

I restarted named on the server. Now dig works, and postfix no
longer complains about mail loop backs.

I was a little annoyed to learn that Postfix only uses DNS aka
named-BIND servers;  it ignores entries in /etc/hosts .  If there
is some way to make it pay attention to /etc/hosts, I would love
to hear about it, because frankly I would prefer to only provide
outside machines with IP addresses for the few machines listed in
/etc/hosts .  Tissue paper security, of course, but every little
bit helps.

Sigh.  Postfix and Sendmail both suck.  Maybe Exim or Qmail
work better, but I'm afraid to find out.  I suspect Mail
Transport Agent programmers are required to sign pacts with
the devil before they are allowed to work on MTAs.

Keith,
FWIW  I've been running Qmail for  about  5 years now, it was an absolute
PITA to set up but once it was up and running its never ever ever had to be
touched except the one time I had to up the softlimit because my mailbox
size had exceeded a couple gigs, not the fault of the MTA. If you are
interested I'd be happy to help you look into it.

Message-ID: <da2207740707061426k6204951w2a91da50e9ee91dd@mail.gmail.com>

OK this one seems kind of simple at first, but the obvious fixes don't seem
to fix it.

I have a dual boot system (acutally multi boot, but only use 2 often), XP
and Fedora 6.
Everything was going hunky-dory, I was using Fedora just yesterday, and I
rebooted into XP for a while.
Now today I go back to Fedora, try to login to GNOME, and it crashes, and
goes back to the GDM greeter login.

I try KDE, which I have on there but don't use very much.  It works fine.

So back to trying to debug GNOME issue, since it isn't an X issue.

I remove the ~/.gnome2/session and copy the default one in its place.  Still
same thing.
I rename the whole .gnome2 directory to .backupgnome2, and try again, still
no dice.
I have recently been using Beryl, which is my next place to look for issues-
but it has been working fine with Beryl for a while now.  Just started
acting up today.

My only other guess right now is a recent package update that could've
messed things up, I was running yum updates yesterday.

I am also going to try to upgrade to Fedora 7 at some point soon, but I want
to at least try to get this issue resolved before doing so, since I want to
do an upgrade instead of a clean install.
If it comes down to it, I have /home as a separate partition so I can just
do a clean install, but I would prefer to try an upgrade first to keep all
the settings etc.  Even when keeping /home on a separate partition, with a
clean install there are still several things that need to be tweaked
afterward to get things running just right.

TIA

Keith,

   Have you asked about this on the postfix mail list?

I've used both Postfix and Qmail, and I would go with Postfix any day of the
week. Qmail is much more complex, and I want an MTA that's straightofrward.

I'm not sure how rebooting your server and the DNS server suddenly not
answering outside requests turns into, "Postfix sucks," but YMMV.

I have never tried to use /etc/hosts with Postfix, but I did Google this:

I don't know much about Gnome, but it's really strange that things got
icky after you used XP. Do you by any chance have some Linux state in a
shared (FAT32) partition that both Linux and XP can access? That could
be a source of problems. I have a shared partition on my dual-booted
laptop, and about the only thing that's there now is a copy of
/boot/grub, so I can change the menu.lst from either Windows or Linux.

By the way, I *really* like Fedora 7. If I hadn't gotten Gentoo
engrained in my muscle memory, I would probably build a Fedora machine.

Howdy,

I was wondering who on the list has an RHCE in RHEL4 (Or 5 now I
guess)? If so, did you just take the straight test or did you go
through the training programs that RedHat offers? Has it proven
advantageous in your job searches?

Thanks,

No there is nothing really "shared" between them, except the fact that the
GRUB bootloader resides on the Windows drive.  And I have booted back and
forth between them many times, it doesn't seem to me that XP has anything to
do with it, more likely some configuration issues or something.  I am
starting to lean towards an issue with Beryl.

Here's a question- how can I change it so that GNOME uses regular Metacity
instead of Beryl, without being able to log in to GNOME?  Is it some config
file I can change?  I'll do some digging on my own but if anyone knows
offhand... :)

I will hopefully upgrade this thing to Fedora 7 in the near future, one way
or another ;)

OK So I did figure out what happened, more or less.

Probably during updates, one of the symlinks or possibly an actual file for
GLX got hosed.

I am running NVidia binary drivers, have been for a long time, they work
well but sometimes when updating X packages, especially ones dealing with
GL, GLU, GLX, etc, it just hoses the NVidia stuff.
So I just re-ran the NVidia installer, it replaced the missing symlinks, and
badda bing badda boom, I can log in to GNOME again.  It came up with some
kind of error concerning bonobo, which I killed as the error msg suggested,
and restarted nautilus.

My guess is GNOME wouldn't start because it is setup to use Beryl, which
relies on 3D acceleration, which needs GLX.
So long story short, GNOME is happy again, and Fedora 7 here I come! :)

I still haven't found where I can switch back to Metacity instead of Beryl
without being able to just change it from within GNOME, using config files
or whatnot.  That's on my list... but at least now I can move forward with
F7.

Now comes the fun part, whether it can cleanly upgrade from F6 to F7, or if
not I'll nuke it from orbit and do a clean install (separate /home
partition).

Thanks, Rich, for letting me know that Qmail is complex also.  Perhaps
all these tools need a high level configurator front end.  That might
make a good business for somebody. designing Postfix config files.

The web page you suggest is informative.  The bottom line is that
if one wants to use Postfix as both the inbound and outbound mail
server (necessary if running a mailing list, for example), one
cannot ever use the info in both /etc/hosts and also DNS, because it
is either/or.  So, by design, Postfix responds differently than ping
and traceroute, and will provide misleading log messages when it does. 
That is broken behavior, made even worse because it is intentional.

Postfix sucks less than Sendmail, granted, and sucks less than Qmail
(I'll take your word on that), but it still sucks.   Perhaps with testing
and a usable front end, the suckiness could be buried out of sight.
Configured properly (requiring much experience and knowledge) the
Postfix engine does a fine job.  

Thanks again for an informative reply.

Keith

Not trying to start a flame war over mta's, but just fwiw, I like
qmail.  I don't think it is so much complex as it is abstruse[1].  It
has some nice, if ideosyncratic features.  I guess, since it *is* a
"transfer agent" sucking *and* blowing is what it does, so maybe
that's a compliment.  ;-)

Well, I didn't say Qmail sucks. I have worked with it some and it seems very
reliable. For me, it's more complex than I want an MTA to be. Some people
swear by it, I didn't like it. YMMV :)

I don't think Postfix sucks either. I've used it on and off since the early
versions came out, and had very good results. I've never tried to do exactly
what you're trying to do, though.

I didn't find it difficult to configure, even in the early days when there
was not a lot of information about it. It was actually much easier to
configure to me than Sendmail.

When Wietse designed Postfix, he had the benefit of seeing the MTAs that
came before. He was certainly very familiar with Qmail, and also chose to go
with a modular design, as opposed to Sendmail's one big binary. One thing I
think he did very well was making Postfix a pretty easy drop in replacement
for Sendmail, which shipped with pretty much every *nix at the time. That's
much less the case now.

That post I found was just from a quick google. I agree with Rich S., asking
on the Postfix list would be a good idea. I've never used a front end
configurator for Postfix, but I would be very surprised if someone had not
written one by now, it's been around for years.

I'm not very dogmatic about tools, find the one that does the job best for
you. That might mean giving Qmail a test drive too. You mentioned Exim in
one of your earlier posts, you might actually want to check it out. I've
never used it, but it seems very reliable and easy to configure.

Message-ID: <469034D7.9090306@opusnet.com>

I am running Gnome 2.18.1 in Ubuntu.

I would like to configure the wallpaper to cycle through a nested 
directory of images such as:

/home/[name]/pictures/mountains/yosemite01.jpg
/home/[name]/pictures/mountains/yosemite02.jpg
/home/[name]/pictures/mountains/eiger.jpg

/home/[name]/pictures/ships/tirpitz.jpg
/home/[name]/pictures/pets/athos.jpg
/home/[name]/pictures/pets/porthos.jpg
/home/[name]/pictures/pets/aramis.jpg

...so that I can set each picture to display for [n] minutes or seconds 
and let it cycle through all the subdirectories under 
/home/[name]/pictures/

I went to www.gnome.org but 'Configuring your desktop' didn't get into this.
Any ideas how to do this, or what I might try downloading?

I do. First time I took the exam back in '02, I took RH300. It's an
excellent course. 
<warning - shameless plug> Based on a slightly older version of the
public course outline, I wrote -
www.amazon.com/Certified-Engineer-Linux-Study-Certification/dp/0072264543
<end shameless plug> 

I've read that the first time pass rate is under 50% - but the course
helps a lot - if you remember that it's a - Red Hat - exam (some Unix
folks who took the course when I did had trouble did not pass).

Thanks,
Mike

I have an RHCE I took the exam after taking the RH300 course with the exam.


I've taken the RH300 and RH401 courses and I've found the content to be
useful and the trainers to be knowledgeable.  Having been in a couple vendor
training classes where someone went who didn't meet the prerequisites and
kept stopping the class progressing when they asked questions about stuff
they were supposed to already know.  I appreciate that Redhat actively asks
and verifies that people meet the prerequisites before starting the class on
the first day.

I haven't changed jobs since getting the RHCE so I haven't done any job
searches although I do get more contacts from recruiters for Linux work.
However, I'm not sure if that's because of the RHCE or because there are
more opportunities.

I did take an opportunity in my company to switch to a different position
that I am fairly certain I got because of the RHCE so I think it is useful
from a job search standpoint.

I wrote a script many many moons ago that did this. I'll see if I can dig it
out of my archives. If I can find it, I'll post it to the list.

 Generally speaking though, there are about a gajillion different ways this
could be achieved. The "gnome-ish" way to do this would be to modify the
gconf key in desktop/gnome/background/picture_filename to be the path to the
file you want. You could write a script that called gconftool-2 and had it
modify the key, and then sleep X seconds and do it again. That's how script
worked. You could also just write a script that changed it and then got
executed by cron.

Maybe that is enough information for you to google out a complete solution?

This happens at work, too.  I move the home directory down a directory
so that the user can copy back the configs he/she needs.  I just create
a directory with the users ID and move the home directory level files
and directories to this new directory.  I then copy the skeleton files
to setup a "virgin" login environment.  This usually cures any problems
after migrating a user to a new environment.

I sincerely thank you for your reply. Thing is, I am a Linux *user.* I 
cannot write scripts. By trade, I am a mechanical engineer by day - with 
computers, I already have too many other things to learn from scratch 
first. For now I am struggling with Blender.

I already hit Google and found a solution which I tried but it didn't 
work. I also read up on www.gnome.org, and nothing there indicated that 
this was possible.

Many thanks again. If there's a one line command to do this, I'll give 
it a shot; if not I'll just resign the request. I have been *using* 
Linux for about 6 years, so I am used to giving up on simple desires.

Subject: [PLUG] Fedora Core 7 install problems revisited and resolved
Message-ID: <e2aeccd60707081805g144da6d1sd1c1bd137bb846a@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy Pluggers,
I figured I'd let the group know that I was able to finally get Fedora Core
7 installed on my Acer laptop. I'm also posting so that this gets indexed by
the search engines since there's an rss feed of our posts, hopefully I'll
save other Acer users the headaches I faced.

Laptop specs:
Acer 5102 WLMi AMD Turion X2 64
ATI Radeon 1100

I posted several weeks back with a problem installing FC7 on the above
laptop, attempting to boot the install media would result in "DOS system
call attempted". After working with a guy from Redhat I was able to figure
out the boot order was wrong in the BIOS, what was weird is that the media
would boot but then if the hard drive was the first boot device it would
cause the DOS error. Having resolved that issue I moved on to the next one.
Attempting to install the 32 bit version of FC caused the installer to hang
unless there was constant input from either the mouse (synaptic touchpad) or
keyboard, the 64 bit version did NOT exhibit this same behavior. Assuming it
was an issue with FC, I moved on to Slackware 12 and found the exact same
issue, unless there was keyboard input (slackware uses a curses based
installer, therefore no mouse input) the installer would hang. Several hours
of googling found me a post regarding ACPI and APIC support, passing those
as boot parameters to the kernel allowed the installer to complete
successfully on its own without my intervention as before.

Now the rub. Disabling ACPI caused the onboard wireless (Atheros) to go to
sleep and unable to wake up, enabling ACPI caused the same issues during
regular boot as were exhibited during install. Several more hours googling
and about 10 kernel compiles later and I'm up and running. It seems,
although I haven't had enough time with the sytem to verify, that changing
PCI access from "ANY" to "Direct" resovles the ACPI issue so that the
machine will function normally and the wireless chip will come out of its
hibernate mode.

Hope this will be useful to someone in the future =)

For Gnome there are a couple of apps that will cycle wallpapers.

The app I use is called "Wallpaper Tray".  If you are using Fedora, just 
use "yum install wp_tray".

If you are using a different distro, you can find the main project at 
http://planetearthworm.com/projects/wp_tray/

Noted. This really is something that should be in the options for gnome
anyway. I just this moment discovered an application called "drapes" that
claims to do what you are looking for, and more. If you are in Debian /
Ubuntu, "sudo apt-get install drapes" or use whatever package management
tool you're used to to install it. FWIW, I discovered this tool by searching
for "wallpaper rotate" in Synaptic.

Subject: [PLUG] apache and PHP and creating files on the host
Message-ID: <1183961914.30494.20.camel@halibut>

Here's something with apache and PHP that I want to do and have been
trying for some time with no success. I know people do similar things,
but I may be approaching it naively, and permissions and security may be
blocking me. I'm stuck ... I don't even know what tools I should be
trying to learn.

I want to have a web page that allows me to execute a command on the
host machine. I can do this with commands like ls and cat ... commands
that do not write to the host's file system. But what I need to do is is
actually run a program that will create files.

Here's what I tried that works ... my web page shows the contents of
junk in my browser.

<?php
echo "<pre>";
system("cat junk");
echo "</pre>";
?>

But if I try a command that actually creates a file like
<?php system("touch junkA"); ?>

no file junkA appears anywhere. I tried exec as well as system. And I
tried variations of system("ssh ted at computername touch junk"); with no
success. There's no password with ssh because I set up a passphraseless
key. 

I can execute the command "ssh ted at computername touch junkA" from the
command line and it works. And I can run the command successfully on the
command line with PHP as "php myfile.php" where myfile.php is the file
above with touch in it.

I know I'm missing something real basic here. Can anyone help?

You can now order your very own OpenMoko.

Could be a very interesting project.  My 2yr old razr is starting to
break apart so maybe I'll pick one of these up.  If it reliably
sends/receives calls and has an addressbook, I'm fine being an early

It depends on what user apache is running under, and what the working 
directory is, as well as the permissions.  You probably want to put 
that file in /tmp/ or somewhere specifically intended for such usages.

Definitely stay away from running ssh from apache process.  Especially 
with a passwordless key!

Also, understand what happens when you do system("touch $var") and var 
is user-supplied.  http://allyourbasearebelongto.us/foo.php?var=;rm+-rf 
and what-not.

Maybe consider trading in the HP for an erl. :-D

Thanks ... honest, I don't want to touch files ...just using that as a
test, probably the wrong one when I think about it. I don't really want
to provide user parameters, want instead to start up pre-configured
builds from the web. Which means creating files ...

I since found that I can create files if I make the directory in which
the files will reside writeable by www-data which is apache's group. Is
this an acceptable thing to do?

Too much invested to leave hp for erl ... but are you saying that what I
want to do more easily handled by Perl?

Eric is spot on. If you are running debian usually the default user
that apache runs as is www-data. You "should" be able to write to /tmp
without opening up your permissions on the app directory.

Sure it is.  Think of all the websites that allow file uploads.
Consider the following code, which is a very common PHP recipe.  When
you upload a file using PHP, it first loads the file into /tmp, and
names it something odd and random.  This code moves it from there into
the directory of your choice and renames it to the original name:

     $filename = $_FILES["filename"]["name"];
     $uploadPath = getcwd() . "/../images/uploads/" . $filename;
     move_uploaded_file($_FILES["filename"]["tmp_name"], $uploadPath);
     chmod($uploadPath, 0666);

Just make sure you never allow both uploads and execution to occur in
the same directory!

> want to do more easily handled by Perl?

PHP is nice because you do not have to turn on ExecCGI to run a PHP
file from apache.  Perl does not allow you this measure of safety,
unless FastCGI addresses this (never used it myself).

There is a danger associated with putting any executable file in an
apache DocumentRoot directory.  If something happens to apache which
causes it to not recognize the file as an executable, it will serve
the file as text.  Then the hacker can get the source code and study
it for security holes.  For this reason, you may want to put the
executable in a directory out of apache's reach, and use a one-line
launcher script to call it.  Sure, the launcher script will tell the
hacker exactly where the executable lives on your hard drive, but he
can only get to it if he gains a shell on your server.  Once that
happens, the game is over anyway.

Verizon uses CDMA and it looks like Open Moko uses GSM. So I don't think you
can use it with them.

I am seriously considering getting one as well.  It has more memory and 
processor than the Motorola A1200 (which is also a Linux phone), which is 
what I planned to get.

Now if I can convince my wife to let me buy it...

Yup, GSM only.  Their reasoning is GSM has a larger audience world-wide
and if the project takes off, supporting CDMA will come.

Found this on the wiki, which appears to be down.  They're probably
getting hammered at the moment.  The wiki has a list of all
internationally supported carriers.

I'm on at&t so I'm hoping a SIM card swap and off I go.

I think it looks interesting since it has a full vga resolution display
which should be very useful for remote administration.

I think mod_perl is typically where you go when you get tired of 
cgi-bin.  At that point, files don't even have to exist.

On GSM phones the activiation is tied to the sim card in the phone.  It is
possible to use a non-approved unlocked gsm phone by moving the sim chip to
the other phone.

I had a coworker who used a Motorola E680i phone he picked up overseas
(since they aren't available in the US) and to use it here he set up a
cingular account with the cheap free phone and moved the chip over to the
E680i and threw away the free phone.  It worked great.

Actually, I kind of wonder if the new phones show up in GSM first because
early adopters can buy and use them without the cell companies knowing what
phone they are using.

Anyone having a harder time fighting spam lately?

I sure am.  I've been trying to build my own IP blacklist, but this is  
not very effective.

How can postfix be configured so that mail is 550'ed when spamassassin  
etcetera doesn't like it?  I've gotten to the point where spam is a  
bugger problem than false positives.

Another thought, since I am using rrset-order in bind 9 to get the  
mail exchangers  or my domain advertised in order, is to check if  
clients are violating the order as a filtering technique.  I use  
postfix, so I imagine
I need to develop a policy that uses say Net::Easytcp to learn from the
partner smtp servers/update them.

I think spammers are retrying now which defeats greylisting.

THe most effective approach would be to whitelist valid clients and  
consider everyone else invalid, but that breaks the way smtp is  
supposed to be defined
and is really nasty when you use mailing lists.

Spammers can decide to look valid, another problem I'm dealing with  
increasingly...

Last weekend I sent email to an old high school friend.  First time she's
every received an email from me.  If your suggestion were implemented that
wouldn't be possible.

Yes, it would be very effective.  It would also break communications.

Subject: [PLUG] Which PCI USB card to use?
Message-ID: <200707092036.37518.gregerk@gmail.com>

I would like to install a PCI card with multiple USB ports on my Linux box. I 
want to make sure I buy one that is compatible with my PCLinuxOS 2007.

Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places, but Googling, searching this list, 
seaching PCLinuxOS' forums  and reviewing PCLinuxOS' hardware compatibility 
pages didn't produce anything useful.

Is there anyone on this list that has used one of these cards before (any 
Linux OS), and if so, which USB card did you use?

Thanks for taking the time to read all this.

Greg

Might be an issue for new users, but it is common to find unlocked
phones on ebay which work with any carrier.  Just swap in the SIM card.

> I'm mainly just wishing it had wifi.

This is on the roadmap for the public market release version in October.
 They had issues with finding a wifi chipset with open documentation and
drivers.  Looks like they found one: Atheros AR6k.  I bet they didn't
find this in time for the developer release unit that came out today.

They have a box of these cards at the Free Geek store. I don't know how
much they want for them, but I'd be surprised if they're over $10.

I imagine there are several helper scripts for this task. Due to Qmail's
license requiring distribution *as source*, Debian ships a package
builder that puts a configuration helper into the resultant package.
Wasn't difficult to deal with with that kind of help. Not trivial though,
and I won't claim to have everything perfectly setup at this point.

I wrote off Exim around 2001 or so. At the time Debian was using v3, and
I they were having to put out many more security alerts for Exim than
Sendmail! Perhaps Sendmail was worse in 1995, but Exim didn't have any
excuses post-2000. Perhaps Exim v4 is better, then again, Sendmail has
also had time to improve security.

I guess I've got to place Qmail as best if you can manage to configure
it. Postfix and Sendmail as pretty well even, and Exim in last place.

I am also having a hard time fighting spam. I used to use spamassin,  
but I had difficulty configuring it. Recently, I implemented a rule  
in my email client to trash any email messages from people not in my  
address book. This has really helped, but it requires me to enter a  
person's email address into my address book.

I don't know if this will help (I know next to nothing of html and web
design), but if you open the page in Opera you can do View > Source and
Opera will open a new tab with the code. Then you can copy and paste
into whatever you want.

Sometimes attachments get displayed inline in the message, but can still 
be viewed as an attachment.  If that just isn't happening here, tell the 
friend to resend as a zip file.  He could just change the extension and 
send and wouldn't even have to zip.

Greylisting killed off a huge chunk of my spam load.  I just wish it was 
easier to do under QMail.  (I don't use it, but a friend does and it is a 
pain to set up right and non-hacky.)

Amavis-new just came out with a new version. It has a huge list of 
dependancies, but for what it tries to do it needs them.  (I have gotten 
three different malware binaries that Amavis cannot read using the default 
Fedora install.  They are self-extracting rar files with an interesting 
payload that only works on Windows.) Installing Amavis on QMail is even 
more painful without killing the server.  (It forks a version of Perl for 
every mail message.)  There is a fix, but I have not tested it yet.

There are some additional filters for SpamAssassin, but I have not seen 
any spam that would trigger them in a long while.

I don't know if there are any good solutions for the spam problem.  The 
only one I have seen that seemed to be effective was used in Russia once. 
It has not been used (unfortunatly) since.

As far as I know, any USB card should work.  Buy a couple at FreeGeek if
you want to save some money.  The thriftstore is open 11-7 Tue - Sat.

No, it's not very effective.  Especially when LOTS of other people are
already doing it for you.  Google "RBL".

Before-queue inspection is slow and inefficient.  Stick with
greylisting and filter what little makes it past that.

I've been using the FuzzyOCR plugin to catch the GIF spams, but it isn't
catching the PDF spams.  Luckily, those have enough spammy stigma that
most of those get filtered, too. 

> Another thought, <snip>

You're working to hard at this.  You can catch like 95% of spam with
hardly any effort and negligible false positives.  You can get to, say,
97% with some extra effort, and 98% with a LOT of effort.  Unless you're
being paid $60k/yr to just do email, there are more appropriate things
to do with your (and everyone else's) time.

In the last few days, the "return to sender" mail has shot through
the roof.   Much of it has been through my IEEE alias, which shouldn't
get any such mails since I can't mail from it.  A half-dozen procmailrc
rules later, that has mostly stopped.

Spam will be a problem forever, but can become a much smaller problem
when the nerds of the world work together to track down every spam
source around the globe, one by one, and repair them.  If the spam
source is a human, we send them out for repair, perhaps by removing
defective appendages.

Message-ID: <46945C7D.5020106@subtend.net>

Not sure if I was turned onto this by linuxdevices.com or PLUG, but I
purchased a decTOP to test out as a viable thin-client.

http://www.dataevolution.com/dectop%20info%202.htm

Only $99, and comes with a kbd/mouse.  The only thing really lame about
these units: they provide you a USB Ethernet adapter as it doesn't have
one on board.  This adapter is supported by the Debian 4.0 installer,
but is still hoaky having this protruding plastic chunk on the back.

Though the Debian installer failed when detecting the keyboard, it
punted me back to the manual install list which you can run through and
works.

I'll be installing a bunch of these as LTSP clients.  I'll post back if
anything interesting crops up with them.

Like ebay.  Buy-now for only $10!!! (..+ $100 shipping)

Looking at the label on the box:

Ship from: New Orleans, LA
ActWgt: 7.5 LB
Assembled in: Mexico
Description: Automatic Machine for Data Processing

They did slap a big red "FRAGILE -- Handle with Care" sticker on it if
that helps. :)

Hopefully you can peel and stick that onto the unit.  After all, it's 
1/4 of the product cost.

I wonder what they charge for the "kick me" sticker?

   I would not be surprised to see that the price is for shipping and
handling, and it's the latter -- particularly the employee time to process
paperwork and set it out for pickup -- that accounts for the majority of
that cost. We'd all feel better about the purchase if they raised the base
price by $30 and charged $10 for shipping.

Its the hot new thing on the block I suppose. I like the fact that its
cleaner and "prettier" as it were then CVS. I'm sure its probably more
secure ect ect ect ad nauseum.

There's no "the replacement" for CVS, but it definitely has some
significant advantages over CVS/RCS, etc.  Other projects handle
things similarly with more features or differently (git, perforce,
etc).   I've found svn to be a practical replacement for CVS in all
instances I've had, having replaced CVS repositories fully with SVN.
It ties in with Eclipse fully, which if used is wonderful; this has
proven quite handy for large Java application development groups.  Its
use from the cmdline is superior to perforce, IMO, which is why I tend
to use it for systems projects even when a perforce deployment is in
place for development.

http://subversion.tigris.org/

I've got both "Practical Subversion" (which I love if for no reason
than the title alone ;), and "Subversion Version Control".  Been a
while since I've gone through them, but check Amazon for reviews and
discount prices, etc.

darcs is also worth looking into.  It's not as widely used, but it
also has some distinct advantages over cvs/svn: for example, it
doesn't use a specific transport protocol, so you can checkout a darcs
repo over http / ftp / etc... and committing can be done directly via
email (if you don't have write access to the repo) so it's trivial to
contribute to a project that uses darcs -- your committed code goes
right into the maintainer's mailbox.. (configurable, of course).

Every darcs check-out also acts as a self-contained repository, so you
can make local commits, roll back your changes, accept commits from
others who checked out from your version, then roll the aggregated
changes back upstream to the main location.  It's like branching /
forking, but with out introducing new syntax.

http://darcs.net/

It's also based on patch theory, which I don't understand ;) but
removes the typical tie between files and version control.  (Have you
ever tried to restore a file that was deleted, then recreated with
different content but the same file name?)

Anyway, it's worth consideration.

I like subversion. It has several advantages over CVS:

  * multiple authentication schemes -- standalone, system accounts,
    Apache auth -- the latter with something resembling ACLs
  * renaming and/or moving files is easy
  * supports binary files
  * great tie-in with Trac: http://trac.edgewall.org/
  * native support for repository mirroring

The major disadvantage (well, it's a disadvantage in my eyes; others 
may differ) is that you can't tweak the repository by using standard 
Unix tools on it. You've pretty much got to treat the repo as a black 
box, trusting the subversion utilities to handle all maintenance 
tasks.

Subversion is in active development, and each new release seems to add 
a useful facility or two (mirroring came with 1.4, the current 
version).

The cvs2svn script, http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/, will let you convert 
a repository (with all changes!). Then you can test it out 
side-by-side with CVS to see if it meets your needs.

The other major problem with Subversion is that if you add something to 
the repository by mistake, you are pretty much stuck with it without 
drastic measures.  They assume if you do something, you meant to do it and 
there is no going back without manual rebuilding of the repository.

Randal gave a good talk on Git (another source code control system) at 
Advanced Topics a couple of months ago.  Towards the end Linus started 
ranting about CVS, Subversion and source code control philosophy.

That is mostly by-design.  If you want linear, centralized version 
control with immutable commits, then subversion is the way to go.  If 
you want something else, well...

Distributed teams don't tend to get along with subversion all that well, 
but it is designed around a centralized model.  Note that git, darcs, 
etc are all distributed systems.  If your developers are not all in the 
same office/company, subversion is probably not the thing.  That said, 
a lot of Perl projects get along quite well with subversion plus svk.

No, it is ENTIRELY by design.  That is a big part of the problem.

It is real hard to manage a distributed development with Subversion.  It 
is real easy to overlap and undo changes.  Of course that problems exists 
in most other source code revision control.

I'm most certainly *not* into C, but I use programs written in it
constantly, with no ill effects (well, *few* ill effects -- it is C,
after all ;)

darcs *is* written in Haskell, but it's also just another pile of binaries.

With all due respect, a moderator didn't think my posts were a
waste and this is a moderated list.  God forbid anyone ask a
question that someone else knows the answer to in case that
wastes the knowledgeable person's time.  I do not consider
the average plug user's time worthless.

I hope someone can offer pointers on using regular

- Tracking folder renaming.

- Simple and Complex meta-data versioning, such as versioning symlinks.

There are many loop-holes in any CVS tool to monitor and control  
concurrent software development that involves several/numerous  
developers that are distributed across several geographic areas. CVS  
has several limitations/loop-holes, and I suspec other source code  
control tracking tools have their limitations/bugs. What has worked  
for me is to have all developers use the same platfrom (i.e, MS, OSX,  
LAMP) with their own unique current tools that are up-to-date. Then,  
to have separation of individual developers working on their own  
unique tasks. The main key piece is to not have the individual  
developers contact each other; when that happens then they start  
sharing code and all hell breaks loose. Tight control is necessary  
for a successful software app/tool to grow; code sharing hinders this.

PLUG Advanced Topics Meeting

Date:       July 16th 2007
Time:       7pm
Location:   Jax Bar
            826 SW 2nd Avenue Portland, Oregon

Speaker:    Val Henson
Topic:      Chunkfs: Repair-driven file system design

Most file systems are designed without thought for what happens when
the file system inevitably becomes corrupted and needs repair.
Chunkfs is an example of repair-driven file system design: a file
system designed from the ground up to be swiftly and efficiently
repairable.  A chunkfs file system is divided into multiple chunkfs of
about 1GB in size which can be checked and repaired with only limited,
minor reference to metadata in other chunkfs.

Bio:

Val Henson is a Linux file systems consultant in Portland, Oregon.
She was one of the architects and implementors of Sun's ZFS file
system.  She has worked in the field of operating systems for 8 years,
focusing on Linux.  She is the author of the "Kernel Hacker's
Bookshelf" series in Linux Weekly News.  Her hobbies include hiking
and maintaining the TCP/IP Drinking Game.

Usual meeting rules apply.

Subject: [PLUG] any bison/yacc experts want to check my work?
Message-ID: <20070712062244.GA6831@gate.kl-ic.com>


I don't understand yacc and bison;  I don't expect to understand
without a lot more effort.  I have other tasks to do first.  I
am porting a program from windows tools to cygwin tools and open
source, and eventually to linux.  The current build uses MKS
yacc ($400!!), and I hope to use cygwin bison instead. 

When I run a legacy file  foo.y  through yacc on my linux box, it
makes foo.c properly, but fails with bison .  I believe this is
because foo.y is written incorrectly and yacc is more permissive
than bison.  It has lines like:

zz_len:   ZZ_LEN '('       = { force_string = 1;};

>From my limited reading of the yacc and bison docs, the first
equals sign may be incorrect.  I think it should be:

zz_len:   ZZ_LEN '('         { force_string = 1;};

When I take out all the pesky extra = signs, the yacc.c file
that yacc builds is the same, except for some small and
unimportant white space changes.  The new foo.y file also
works with bison.  So I think this is the right thing.  

The .y file is currently semi-confidential - the code I am open
sourcing hasn't been released yet.  But I'm sure I can get 
permission from the owner to share the file with a knowledgable
yacc/bison expert without hassle.  

So:  Any yacc/bison experts with a few minutes to critique a
.y file ?

I think you have your answer.  If both versions of the file produce the
same .c file except for some white space outside of quoted white space,
then you are good.  Now, if that file produces the same .c file from
bison or flex then
you should be in like flint.

Just out of curiosity, what happens when you use bison -y?  Or is your
"yacc" just a reference to bison -y?

This is not a moderated list.  Even if it were, you (and not anyone else)
are responsible for what you do.

Then do folks the courtesy of spending 30 seconds trying to answer your
quesion yourself before asking the list.

Consider how long it takes to read and think about a question asked in
email.  Let's call that a conservative 10 seconds.  Multiply that by the
number of people subscribed to PLUG, 632.  That's 6320 human-seconds, or
_1_hour,_45_minutes,_20_seconds_ of other people's time you've taken,
because you couldn't be bothered to do a little research first.

Oh?  In my experience, all servers retry, though some are slow.  You can
manually whitelist them: http://www.google.com/search?q=postgrey+whitelist

I'm sorry you're dealing with someone who thinks that you're responsible

Subject: [PLUG] unifying the X clipboards
Message-ID: <c834ec80707121240t393738dbw5b662b89beae5f0@mail.gmail.com>

This is a pet peeve of mine that has recently really started to drive
me up the wall.

I've been using X and emacs for most of my computing lifetime, so I'm
hardwired to using mouse-select to copy, then C-y to paste.

While this still works in emacs, in my current environment (XFCE 4 on
Kubuntu Feisty),  it does not work reliably in other applications.
There are very clearly (at least) two different clipboards working --
one that is filled by highlighting text and pasted by middle-clicking,
and another that is filled with M-w, C-c, C-k, or C-w, depending on
the application.  That second clipboard then pastes with C-y (or C-v,
or probably a host of other strokes I don't know about).

This means that I frequently highlight something in Firefox, whack the
trackball over to gaim, and hammer C-y to paste, dumping in the last
line of content I killed in emacs or Eclipse.  (I use dvorak, so
pasting with C-y is like C-t on a qwerty keyboard.  It's very easy to
do while still using the mouse.)

So, my question is: is there any way that I can make all these
techniques use the same clipboard? and, can I somehow convince *all*
apps to use C-y to paste?

Thanks!
Rogan

Rogan,

   I don't have a direct answer to your question, but I know that in several
console apps running in virtual consoles in X, I need to hold the shift key
when I use the mouse to select text, and when I click both trackball buttons
to paste. Pine is an example of such an application.

   After a while I don't pay attention to whether I need the shift key, I
just apply the proper approach. The situations that irritate me are blocking
text in Firefox and not being able to paste it in a text-based application.
I've not figured out why.

I don't know the answer either, but it drives me nuts also. It's a huge
time-waster. Select + double-click works in a terminal window, but not
in other apps, e.g., OpenOffice.org. Ctrl-c + ctrl-v works in
OpenOffice.org, but not in a terminal window. Copying and pasting
within an application works OK, once you have figured out which system
it is using. It's inter-application copying and pasting that is
infuriating. I don't care what system we end up with, I just wish there
was some way to force all applications to use the same system. 

I'd be happy to lend my support to such a cause, although I guess all I
can do is stand on a street corner, wave my hands furiously, and shout
loudly. If that will help, let me know which is the best corner to
stand on and I'll be there.

A cute trick for bash and xterm:

I work with a lot of xterms.  For years, I have been using pwd,
cd, and mouse-cut-and-paste to copy the working directory from
one window to another. 

Now I have a better way, involving some aliases in .bashrc:

  alias sd='echo $PWD > ~/.sd'
  alias ds='cd `cat ~/.sd`'

I type 'sd' in the xterm I want to copy the working directory
from, and 'ds' in the xterm that I want to copy the working
directory to.

This is somewhat insecure;  if anyone manages to write some
executable stuff into ~/.sd, then 'ds' will execute it.  However,
it should not be difficult to write a program that is similar to
'ds' that tests the contents before changing directories to it.

I use 'sd' and 'ds' because I am left handed;  'kl' and 'lk' 
might be easier for right handers, and I will humbly accept
the honor of being immortalized in the initials.  ;-)

So, does anyone in the world care about new technology in non-web-based 
email clients?

In my experience, people either use webmail of their choice (and envy 
gmail's technology while bitching about its creepiness) or are hopelessly 
tied to some old client they started using fifteen years ago (*raises 
hand*).

Who's doing the hotstuff email client these days?  I want near-magical 
threading (like keeping threads together no matter what foreign clients 
might have done to munge the headers), automatic address-booking of every 
address I type, and I require it to speak to a couple of mail servers and 
allow me to choose from a number of accounts for each message composition, 
reply, forward, or bounce.  I wouldn't mind something that has calendar 
integration -- especially if it links to some database or service that I 
can run for updating and checking my calendar via the web and automating 
calendar-linked processes (like texting myself when I have an 
appointment).

I've been using Pine forever.  I tried using mutt and got nowhere with it 
because the benefits (proper freedom) were not totally effective at 
motivating me to tackle the .muttrc and make it handle my various roles 
properly.

I am currently using Sylpheed for my school IMAP account, but I don't like 
it much and it seems relatively feature-free.

Whatever you've got, I'll read.

You must have requested the shell with the extra non-security features 
or something.  AFAICT, anything that comes out of $(cat file) is going 
to be a literal unless you go out of your way to eval it.  Got an 
example?

Excellent!

A couple minor tweaks seem reasonable to me:

  alias sd='echo "cd $PWD" > ~/.sd;'
  alias ds='source ~/.sd'

Sourcing the file, rather than executing it, seems somewhat cleaner 
and more secure to me.

All in all, however, that's a tremendous solution to a common problem. 
Bravo!

The bash shell has a commands that extend this capability to more than
one directory.

Check out pushd and popd

pushd pushes the current working directory in a directory stack.

popd pops the directory on top of the list out and cd's to it.

There are more options.  You can use dirs to list the stack.

Wait a second.  We're falling into the shell security twilight zone here 
or something.  We're talking about bash, right?

$(cat ~/.sd) only executes cat.  OTOH, `source` executes whatever 
commands are in the file.  Keith's original code has no security holes 
that I can see.

The fact that Sylpheed is relatively feature-free is what I love about
it. De gustibus non dispuntandum est. You might try Sylpheed-Claws,
which has more goodies.

When I first started with Linux I tried Thunderbird first, because I
was still using a Windows computer most of the time and there is a
Windows version as well. Later I tried Evolution, installed by default
on Ubuntu. But both were bloated and neither (amazingly) could let me
get mail from just one account. The "get mail" button checked all
accounts, which is not satisfactory when I get hundreds of e-mails a
day. One of my accounts is a business account that I need to check to
see if I have any customer orders. Sometimes I'm in a hurry and don't
want to take the time to wait for all the other accounts to be
downloaded.

As far as I know, nobody. Everyone has gotten so caught up with "beating
Outlook" that no one seems to have put energy into a really killer email app
like you describe. Everyone stops at "good enough" and/or is so tied up
trying to emulate Outlook they aren't thinking about how it could be done
better. Thunderbird might get there, but it's not there yet. There's some
really exciting stuff happening in the Tinymail world, but that's mostly
focused at "light" email applications for handhelds and whatnot and is not
likely to have the feature set you want, but it would make a helluva
platform for someone to build on.

I used Sylpheed-claws (as JJJ mentioned) for while a few years ago, but it
didn't stick. I found the UI ugly / clunky, and it was less stable than I
need an email app to be.

I use Gmail for personal correspondence, and Evolution at work, where I have
to connect to an exchange box.

Hi Michael,

Sorry I didn't respond right away - I'm on vacation with my family.

I'm glad you enjoyed the game. You can pass along your copy of Dirk Dashing
to a friend, provided 1) you keep no copy for yourself, and 2) your friend
accepts the licensing agreement.

The license is stringent, but I feel we're more open about it than other
companies - we allow you to buy the game once and install it on all the
computers you own, not buy a separate copy per machine. And I don't mind if
you pass it along to a friend provided you keep no copy yourself. I just
don't want to see a single full version copy end up being played by hundreds
of people at the same time, or show up on some torrent somewhere. The game
company income is just enough to cover operating expenses, with a little
left over. I'm trying to grow the business to the point where I can do this
full time, so any piracy definitely has a big impact on me.

Regarding the binary: if the game company ever closed its doors, so to
speak, I would definitely make provisions so that our games live on. But I
have no plans to EOL the game, so the binary will probably remain under the
current license for awhile. But I have been considering writing a tutorial
on how to build you own game levels. All of the game levels are XML files
that are easily editable, but none of the tags or their range of values are
currently documented, nor are the rules for how things need to be built and
placed so that they work right. Also you would have to replace an existing
level - if I write the tutorial, I will probably add a new item to the game
menu for playing custom levels. I was planning to test the waters with a
future poll (now that we're doing polls on our site), to see how many people
would be interested in making their own custom levels for Dirk Dashing. If
there's enough interest, I'll do it.

I've also been considering the possibility of releasing the source code, and
I've been doing some investigation in that area. But I don't just want to
dump the source out there - I have plans for sequels in the future that will
reuse much of the same code, so releasing the source code means I have to be
able to continue to use it for commercial games. To do it right, I need to
establish an official baseline for the code, license it properly, manage
contributions, and setup a forum where folks can ask questions and know what
they can and can't do with the code if they want their contributions to make
it into the official baseline. This all takes time and effort on my part,
which I currently don't have as a part-time game developer. So I am waiting
until I can do this full time before I make such a move.

Thanks for writing, and for respecting the game license. I appreciate your
questions.

Sincerely,

Troy Hepfner
My Game Company

Fun game, just finished it.

My question is, can I simply give my registered copy to a
friend now?

Will Dirk Dashing ever be eol'ed and the binaries moved
to a less restrictive license?  The game engine can be
used for future games, so I'm not expecting a source
release.

I do.  Unfortunately, I haven't found anything compelling enough to
switch, so I go on using Mutt on a local maildir on my own host.

Heck, I even use Mutt (via SSH) on my N770, pecking at the on-screen
keyboard rather than using the built-in email client, or Sylpheed.

For PIM functions, I use pocket-sized calendars and notepads.

My own email feature list is more like:
 * Good threading 
 * Handles huge mailboxes easily
 * Automagically finds and remembers email addresses and other contact info
 * Good archiving & search functions
 * Lightweight
 * Unobtrusive UI

I keep hoping that Sylpheed or something will do it, but not yet.

BTW, has aonyone tried Evolution for Windows?  It'd be wonderful if
there was a way to replace LookOut with something that looks the same,
but sucks less.

First the wrong version of the posting went out - working late :-(.
The sd command should be simply:

alias sd='pwd > ~/.sd'

The potential security flaw is that if Eve somehow gets write access
to .sd she could write something like :
   ~ ; rm -rf *
... into that file.  Running ds would then wipe out the home
directory, for example.  What is really needed in a less trustworthy
environment is a version of ds that contains a filter to detect crap
like that, and emit a warning rather than execute something nasty. 
Ask Randal;  he can probably come up with a Perl one-liner to do it.

Of course, if Eve can fiddle with .sd , she can probably create her
havoc more directly.  Still, the rule of mimimum privilege applies.

Keith

P.S.  ... and no, pushd and popd and dirs cannot do the same thing;
they only work within one bash shell, not between them, as this is
intended to.  It purposely leaks information between bash shells.

I just tried something like this, and it didn't work.  Apparently the 
output of the backtick is handed straight to the cd command.

galens at toto:~$ cat > foo
/home/galens/bin ; touch /home/galens/bar

You may want to add something like $PID as well.

And, even though you're sharing it across multiple bash shells, you can
end up "clobbering" the existing file since each time you invoke sd you
will overwrite the previous instance.  If you're running two shells, you
could have one shell overwrite the value from another shell.

I like Evolution on Ubuntu, but there are some buggy things that I  
don't like. I still use my MacBook and OSX for personal and business  
email correspondence. The Mac Mail app is pretty clean and has a lot  
of features like good junk mail filtering. I also like the rule  
management feature that lets me filter email messages into separate  
folders.

I've got an ION USB Turntable. It shipped with Audacity software for
Windows, so I installed the Linux version (with YaST, I think). I have a
bunch of 78 RPM records I want to record. (I discovered the warning that
I need a different stylus.)

The turntable has 33 and 45 rpm settings, but the advertising says that
Audacity can adjust something recorded at one of those speeds to sound
right, but I haven't found it in the documentation. I tried the Audacity
forum. I can log in, but there appear to be no forums!

Anyone else using Audacity, or some other program, to digitize 78's?

Yup, yup, yup. I know exactly what you need. I used the feature a lot
when taking phonetics classes because it enabled me to slow dow speech
so I could actually hear. The problem with slowing down a recording is
that it also lowers the pitch. The result is that Ciribiribin sung by a
skinny soprano comes out sounding like fatty the tuba grunting out an
elephant walk.

Change Speed. I don't know what magic Audacity uses to do it, but
Effect > Change Tempo slows the playback time down without changing the

or 45 rpm.

And yes, you need a different needle. 33, 45 and 16 rpm use a needle
1/3 the size of the old 78 rpm needle. You may need to change the
entire cartridge. It may also be hard to find the old size
needle/cartridge.

Thanks. As soon as I get a new stylus I'll give it a try. However, what
I'll need to do is speed up a 33 rpm recording to 78. (May be a semantic
difference between us.)

I have found sources for a stylus specifically marketed for my model
turntable. It's about $25, which seems a bit steep for a needle, but the
old recordings would be damaged if I used the other needle, so it will
be worth the expense. Also, the current needle would be damaged, too,
from dragging through the dust in the bottom of the groove, not to
mention missing most of the important stuff featured up a little higher
in the groove.

I had some digitized reel to reel tapes that had a similar problem.  On a
single tape there were sections that were recorded at different speeds  but
digitized all at one speed.  In the Effect menu of audacity is a  Change
Speed. I just selected the section of tape with the wrong speed and  used
Change Speed to correct it.  It worked just fine.

Needles are expensive.  More now that there is not as much demand.
The last time I got a really got needle for my turntable it was about $30 but
that was for a $150 cartridge (about the cost of the turntable itself).

Message-ID: <200707132300.23919.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

Help!  I have to use windows to make cross-platform open source software 
work on windows so that windows users won't have an excuse to use 
windows.

I've tried cygwin and sshd, but the login time (with key authentication) 
is about 2 seconds.  I can't find anything in the internets about slow 
sshd on cygwin.  But even if I could, I'm not sure that would solve the 
problem.

What I really want is a remote shell with access to the gui (but not a 
gui shell), decent job control, tab complete.  You know: linux.  Is 
there any way to do this on win2k?

I'm already suffering huge headaches with everything else that's wrong 
about windows, but the cmd shell makes me feel like I'm working through 
a fog and cygwin (if it doesn't make things foggier) is only a small 
flashlight vs the soup.

Any suggestions on how I might minimize the swearing?

Thanks,
Eric

So, my father was an audiophile. You know the routine, 300 dollar  
record needles. 5,000 dollar amps, just to hear his 78rpm operas. of  
which he had about 30 linear feet.
</old man mode>

I heard an amusing survey the other day, where today's teens-tweens- 
kids can't hear the difference between a 128 and a 192 bit mp3.

Kind of sad, kind of not.

A could of options depending on what you are doing.

Really hard if it was originally 128bit to begin with.

I use to have stuff that I could tell the difference but no longer.

I haven't tried setting up a sshd server on windows, but I'd suggest
using a native version, not something under cygwin.

I strongly suggest using rxvts instead of the default cygwin shell --
they work like.... rxvts ;) as opposed to slightly-less crippled cmd
prompts.  The windows powershell is also a *very* powerful
environment, but I only know enough to believe that -- I haven't tried
to use it for much my self.  It does resize properly though, which is
a huge win.  (You can also do things like script visual studio actions
from an unrelated powershell.)

Tab complete will come with bash, which will come with cygwin.  As I
mentioned above, rxvt!  AFAIK, there is no way to do window-by-window
redirection of MS apps to another host like X allows, but you can run
an X server under cygwin and then redirect the X apps, or run vnc,
rdesktop, or a few other similar gui shells to accomplish your
graphical tasks.

> I'm already suffering huge headaches with everything else that's wrong

If you're an emacs user or just a fan of gnu readline (eg: C-a to get
to the head of a line, C-k to kill a line.. etc.) xkeymacs is a
necessity--it works *very* well.

I've also found that bb4win, xoblite, or bblean all make the windows
experience much nicer.  (They are all win32 ports of the Black Box
family of window managers.)
Be wary though, if visual studio is at a break point, it may prevent
you from changing virtual desktops (so don't start a build/debug cycle
with breakpoints and then switch desktops to catch up on Joel on
Software while you wait for your app to halt -- you'll likely have to
reboot since the task manager is open on another desktop already.  You
*do* have the task manager open all the time, right? ;)

There is an emacs for win32 distribution out there, but I actually
prefer using cygwin's, since it makes use of unix-like paths, and uses
the same home dir as cygwin.  I can't help you if you're into vi -- it
should just work :)

I eventually used VMWare Converter to make an image on a server, then
an Ubuntu Live CD and gparted to resize the XP partition, installed
Feisty, copied the image over, and now I run my xp install in vmware
when I must, and Linux for the rest.  (3 months running and so far no
one has noticed ;).

The biggest problem has been explaining why I'm able to install
software so much faster than everyone else...

Well, I don't know about the Cygwin sshd server, but I couldn't live
without Cygwin X on a Windows box as a client. You start the X server,
and then open up real X terminals. I forget whether rxvt is there -- I
don't use it anyhow. Quite a few of the Linux GUI apps have been ported
to Cygwin, although many of them also have native Windows ports. But if
you're a bash/xterm type of person, Cygwin X is great.

For remote access to a Windows machine from Linux, you have two
reasonable options. If the server supports Remote Desktop Protocol,
either "rdesktop" or "krdc" will work. If it doesn't, you'll need to
install RealVNC on the Windows server and use either "kdrc" or
"vncviewer". But VNC with a Windows server is dog-slow -- RDP is much
faster.

That is a bit better.  Thanks.

Now if I can just figure out how to get cygwin to *uninstall* anything.  
For some reason, cygperl came along with that, which will totally get 
in the way of things.

<rant>
Do I really have to go through the list of thousands of packages and 
deselect things individually by clicking "the cycle glyph" (which 
causes dependencies to be re-selected, and ad-infinitum ack!)?

While that would be super-nice, I mostly just need to be able to 
*launch* graphical apps (at all.)  I can do this with sshd if I 
configure the service to be able to access the desktop, but the 2s 
delay is a real bummer.

TightVNC with the dfmirage mirroring driver seems a bit better, but 
still painful.  Mostly just because cygwin's package manager is this 
horrid braindead gui.

>You *do* have the task manager open all the time, right? ;)

Yep!  They should have at least made some kind of remote BSOD console so 
I could exercise the right-pinky-finger-of-doom on it.  Managing 
runaway processes with a mouse is sort of silly when all of your 
processes routinely run away.

Apparently there is a market for turntables in the DJ and wanabe DJ
world, and this ION turntable is made for them. The main difference that
I can see about this particular model is the USB feature, which I have
not figured out how to use with Linux. I can use the normal audio out
connections, and have used the turntable to record with Gramophile on
Linux. I've had to use the Windows version of Audacity to record with it
connected via USB. I like the scratch filtering in Gramophile better
than Audacity, so I haven't bothered with trying to get the turntable
connected to my Linux machine via USB.

Is "cygperl" something other than the standard Perl interpreter that
came with Cygwin? I have Windows boxes with both the full Cygwin
install, including Perl, Python, Tcl/Tk and Ruby, plus the ActiveState
Perl, Python, Tcl/Tk, plus the Ruby One-Click Installer Ruby
interpreter, and all live happily side by side with completely
independent package repositories!!

You probably *don't* want to remove either Perl or Python from a Cygwin
install -- lots of stuff may stop working if you do. You might be able
to get away without Tcl/Tk, however.

Actually, you don't. The simplest thing to do is uninstall the whole
Cygwin distro, then install the bare minimum (default) plus X Windows.
Then if you find something missing, you can find it in the install tree
and just install it -- Cygwin will drag in the dependencies.

It isn't clear to me whether you're trying to access Windows graphical
apps or Cygwin graphical apps, or whether you're trying to access them
locally or remotely. So here are some general clues.

1. Remote access to a Windows desktop from a Linux desktop: as I noted
before, either "krdc" or "rdesktop" should work if the Windows system
has the RDP service available and enabled. If RDP isn't available,
RealVNC server on Windows is an option, but a slow one relative to RDP.
I think there is also a NetMeeting client for Linux, but NetMeeting is
(politely put) "deprecated". I usually use a term that *rhymes* with
"deprecated" when referring to NetMeeting.

2. Using a Linux desktop as an X terminal for Cygwin applications
running on a Windows server: I've never been able to make this work.
Apparently there are so many security issues with doing this that there
are lots of configuration options you need to set and permissions you
need to give. But I've never needed it.

3. Using Cygwin locally as a "Linux virtual machine" on a Windows box:
hardly a day goes by where I work that I don't do this -- it's my
principal mode of operation. But I always install the full Cygwin
distro, which is a gigabyte or two.

4. Running "open source" graphical applications on a Windows box: many
of them have been ported to Windows and have one-click installers. LyX
and TeXmacs, two GUI document editors, for example, both work on
Windows, including the native TeX tools they require. The Maxima algebra
package also has a native port. I don't remember about Scribus and
Inkscape but I think they do as well.

The tool I use most is R, and it not only has a native Windows port, the
R Windows port is actually a lot easier to use than the base Linux
version! But in general, when I want to run an open source app on
Windows, my first choice is a native port, second choice is Cygwin, and
if neither of those is available, a Linux virtual machine.


In short, it's possible for a hard-core Linux geek to survive, even
thrive, on a Windows box for 6 to 8 hours a day. Just don't ask me to
explain the *Windows* scheduler. :)

For the archives, this kind of slow login time can be DNS-related. If
you still have sshd set up, try disabling the ReverseMapping (I've
seen the setting called VerifyReverseMapping or ReverseMappingCheck,
depending on the version), especially if you know that the connecting
client doesn't have a reverse DNS entry.

Modern pop CDs are mastered at way-too-high levels with limited
dynamic range to start. Then they're being played through $3 earbuds
at high volume. Between crappy output devices and noise-induced
hearing loss (http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2005-09-12-hearing-loss_x.htm),
we're lucky if teens-tweens-kids can pick out a melody from an mp3.

Specifically, someone with noise-induced hearing loss is most likely
to lose the very high and perhaps very low frequencies... exactly
those lost when dropping bitrate in mp3 compression. To those folks,
the 128- and 192-bit mp3s may actually sound identical.

Those appear to have both been deprecated for UseDNS, which is "no" in 
my config, so no luck there.

Seems to be mostly hung-up on the encryption possibly the lsass process.

I think I need to look at rsh or something.  I really don't need the 
encryption on an internal network (in qemu cases, so internal as to not 
even leave the box.)  It's not like a windows box is secure anyway.

GNOME Terminal in newer versions of GNOME opens new terms in the $PWD
of the previous terminal instance rather than ~. I.e. if you're in
/tmp and do Ctrl-Shift-n, you get a new terminal also in /tmp.

Or maybe that's a feature that has been there forever and I only
recently turned it on. Either way, it's handy.

I'm quite a ways from Free Geek. Stopped by the Radio Shack store in Woodburn 
and picked up a Belkin F5U220 5-port USB card for under $20. Works like a 
champ. Thanks again for the responses.

I have an old IBM t21 laptop, p3-800mhz and 384 megs
ram.  I am trying to install edubuntu onto it to give
to my niece but it seems to run extremely slow(imagine
click, go for coffee, come back, wait... ).

Also, it appears to be running gnome, but I was under
the impression it was supposed to be running KDE?

The last curious thing(and probably related) is...  It
boots fine in vga mode, or in standard mode restricted
to 800x600\32. However it doesnt seem to want to boot
if I just boot normally from the cd. Everything
appears fine, gets to where it should be switching on
the graphical interface, and dies.  I let it sit
there, thinking it might be the slow system its on,
but it sat for over an hour with nothing but a blank
screen. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated...

John

John,

   We have a ThinkPad 600E (PII/400MHz, just upgraded from 128M RAM to 256M
RAM). It's run a debian derivative, red hat through 7.3, and slackware from
8.0 through the current 11.0. It was pretty slow because of the limited RAM
and the GUI apps my fiancee runs. I just bought a replacement hard drive
(80G/7200 RPM), and we'll be installing Xubuntu on it this coming week. The
RAM you have in the T21 should be plenty, but a faster hard drive would
help.

   Both KDE and Gnome consume a lot of resources. I had a workstation here
with 64M RAM that ran everything sufficiently fast with the Xfce that we've
always used as the desktop/window manager. I was preparing to give it away
and tried booting a Knoppix disk. It refused to load the GUI (KDE) because
there was insufficient memory. After searching on Google, I discovered how
to boot Knoppix and have it load Xfce. No problems.

   So, my suggestion is that you consider the Xubuntu variant since that uses
the lightweight GUI. You might also put in a faster hard drive.

The Windoze app I am working on open sourcing works fine under WINE.
Hooray, no Windoze!  Except ...

The source includes about 13000 lines (in 19 files) of Micro$oft
MASM assembly code, for speedup and optimization (no, I don't want
to replace the functions with C code right now).  That assembly
format is not compatable with the Linux assemblers nasm and as and
gas.  Is there a Linux-native assembler that can read MASM format
(perhaps simplified), or a translator that can re-render the MASM
files as nasm/as/gas input?

Hm.  I thought that MASM used Intel format, like NASM.  Google turned up
a sed script for converting MASM to GAS:

Let us know how it goes,

Hm.  Well, Plain ol' Ubuntu works great on my 400 MHz, 256MB beastie,
but Edubuntu might drag a bit because it's actually an application
server setup, meant to run on a heavy-duty host supporting a bunch of
diskless terminals.

Nope.  Ubuntu and Edubuntu are Gnome, Kubuntu is KDE.  Xubuntu is
ligher-weight and runs XFCE; in my experience, any advantage there is
lost the minute you run a pig like Firefox or OpenOffice.

There's a Linux Clinic this Sunday, July 15, from 1PM to 5PM, at Free Geek.
They're at 1731 SE 10th Ave, 2 blocks south of Hawthorne.

There's bus info and links to maps at: http://www.freegeek.org/map.php

Come on by, look for the signs, walk right in the South door, have some
coffee and cookies if you like.

NOTE: Free Geek will be closed that day.  We will have some spare parts
on hand, but if you want to buy hardware to try Linux with, come by the
store today, Friday or Saturday.

Think globally and act neighborly,

And I shall be there with my sweet new desktop showing off Feisty amd64
on which I have also installed Windows under VirtualBox. If you're
interested in VirtualBox, come on by and poke at it.

If that doesn't excite you, I'm also bringing cookies. :)

I too am playing with edubuntu.  I have the 64 bit server installed on my
server box at home.  I have been trying to get two different P3/500Mhz boxes
to boot over the network with no luck.  I can plug my laptop in and boot
over the network fine (boots super fast too).  So I know that the server is
working properly.  I have tried setting the bios to network boot but I still
get "no operating system found" after POST.   I think the problem I am
running into is the proper boot rom for the two older boxes.  Everything I
can find about booting older hardware over a network tells me to go here:
http://rom-o-matic.net/ and download the proper rom.  The problem I think I
am running into is how do I find the PC ID's of my network cards. I have
burnt about 20 different roms to cd's and still no go at this point.   Does
anybody know if there is a way to probe the nic card from the CLI to get
this information?   I have been banging my head for about 3 days and my son
really wants to have his "own computer".

Thanks in advance

They typically have a bunch of keyboards, mice, and monitors on hand.
However, if you have a higher res monitor that isn't too hard to haul,
you might want to consider taking it. I took my SuSE 10.1 box, without
keyboard, monitor, or mouse, the last time I went. We had some trouble
getting it working with the lower res monitor. Eventually, it worked and
we solved one of my problems. If I had taken my LCD monitor it would
have saved time.

I think so, but I don't remember what it is at the moment. There might

I had similar problems trying to install ubuntu on my laptop. Everything
would freeze up and it would take a long time to get any kind of response
from it. I found that Kubuntu installed just fine (with no hanging). So I
went with that, and since I prefer gnome, I added gnome and removed kde and
now everything works great.

Message-ID: <469AD081.8040204@frankhunt.com>

I am new to Debian and am running into all kinds of confusion when I 
want to load an application - let's pick php5 as an example.  Is there a 
place where I can get all the various pieces and parts and dependencies 
at once?  It looks like packages.debian.org should be the right place, 
but I see a list of "depends", "recommends" or "suggests".  If I go to 
the section "Download php5" and follow the links and download the .deb 
package, it is not complete.  The dependencies are not satisfied 
(libraries and other stuff).  do I need to download each of the parts 
and install them?  If so, in what order?

Frustrated.

Yes it does but I need to know how to find the name of the package that 
I need.  "apt-get install php5" does not work - It returns with 
dependency errors also.  There's gotta be someplace that lists the 
packages.  I just don't know where to look.  I've googl'd this every way 
I can think of to no avail.

Doesn't debian have a package manager like or similar to aptitude?

What about a GUI package management system such as Synaptic?  When
using Ubuntu, typically when I select a package, Synaptic informs me
that it needs to select other packages as well to meet dependencies.
Of course, I thought apt via command-line prompted you to download
extra packages as well to satisfy dependencies.

Might you look at adding additional package repositories to
/etc/apt/sources.list?

synaptic seems to work now.  i tried it a while ago and had problems. 
this time i used the "broken" filter and removed some junk.  i also 
removed all php4 and php5 references and re-installed.  i think we may 
be on to something here.  thanks.  now to get php5 configured with 
apache2.  then to figure out how to set the screen resolution to what my 
video card and screen are capable of <sigh>

Synaptic is an awesome tool. But you also need to make sure you have
enabled all the repositories that you might need. In Synaptic go into
Settings > Repositories where you will find optiions for enabling
additional repositories.

Some notes and instructions, using PHP5 docs for example info:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.unix.debian.php

# dpkg -l 'php4-*'

Here are some "must-have" commands for debian and it's derivitives:

# update your local copy of the debian package repositories:
apt-get update

Run an apt-get update whenever you need to install something, just do
the update *first*.  It's not a bad idea to schedule apt-get update to
run periodically.

# upgrade all your installed packages:
apt-get upgrade

# apt-get dist-upgrade is a more ... extreme upgrade. if you go from
one release to another, then dist-upgrade is what you want.  Others
can explain dist-upgrade better than I can, and you're probably safe
not needing it, at least at this point.

# search for packages:
apt-cache search php5

That will return all packages that have to deal with php5.

apt-cache search php5 apache

That would return packages that match both php and apache.

#install something
apt-get install apache php5

I *think* that will leave you with working and cooperating php and
apache installs.

# list currently installed packages
dpkg --list

# uninstall a package
apt-get remove php5


Hopefully that helps -- apt-cache search is key.  Documentation for
all the install packages can usually be found in
/usr/share/doc/<package-name>.

Thanks!  I think this is the breakthrough I needed.

I haven't heard Joshua Drake's name mentioned in a long time. I 
interveiwed him for Computer Bits a decade or so ago when he was 
heavily involved with the Linux Documentation Project. I'm glad to see 
he's remained quite active in free software.

Once again, I have a question that seems on the surface to be very
simple but is causing me difficulty. I want to provide secure web access
to my build environment (which is CruiseControl and Ant). 

Locally on my LAN, it's working fine and what I do to control builds is
bring up the JMX console (http://localhost:8000) or the CruiseControl
Web Reporting Project (http://localhost:8080/cruisecontrol ... you build
a war file and put it in the Tomcat webapps directory for this).

But how do I do this securely over the web ... is it even possible? We
can't have strangers invoking our JMX console and controlling our builds
with http://www.MyHostName.com:8080/cruisecontrol?

Probably with encryption and authentication.  Depending on who is at the 
other end, vpn might be an option (or even ssh), otherwise you probably 
need to be looking at apache and ssl.

Thanks, Eric ... you always got good stuff to say. I can vpn and ssh and
have done that. What I really want to do is control my builds securely
through the browser. When I start a vnc server on the server and use a
vnclient to connect, I think I am actually then getting a desktop on my
server and then running the browser locally on the server. I get to see
it here at home though.

Here's what I got that "sort of" works. If I startup CC on my server
with the -user and -password options, I get a login/pw box when I invoke
http://www.MyHostName.com:8000 No docs that I can find on how this pw is
transmitted ... I suspect clear text (oops!) but that's only a gut
feeling gotten from working with this stuff. I don't know yet how to get
a login/pw box when I invoke the war file with Tomcat.

ssh -L 8001:127.0.0.1:8000 <remotehostname>
ssh -L 8081:127.0.0.1:8080 <remotehostname>

Then connect to http://localhost:8001 (or

   Several years ago, Josh moved his home and business from NE Portland to
The Dalles or Hood River; one of the eastern suburbs. He's very active on
the postgres-users list.

Subject: [PLUG] Laptop Radeon 7500 movie problem
Message-ID: <20070716224430.GA16796@gate.kl-ic.com>


When I upgraded the distro on my T30 laptop (with an ATI Radeon
Mobility 7500) a couple of months ago, it lost the ability to render
movies to the external VGA port.  All the static graphics rendered
fine, but movie players like Xine, VLC, and Mplayer would only draw
an outline box around a black rectangle on the external display. 
On the laptop LCD screen, the movies render just fine.  

I just spent quite a few hours frobbing on xorg.conf;  after trying
lots of plausible tweaks on the radeon driver Device section,  the
anomaly succumbed to    Option "DMAForXV" "false"   , which turns
off the DMA to the frame buffer.  Apparently, DMA writes only one
copy to the frame buffer, when in fact the clone mode renders two
identical images side by side.  I sent a note to the chief radeon
developer, asking him to fix DMA if possible.

Until then, I guess I will use non-DMA mode for Xvideo, and perhaps
drop a few frames.

On older distros, the laptops just cloned the LCD to the VGA port,
which is how I would like to operate until the presentation applications
catch up with dual-head.  I'm told the new OpenOffice Presentation tool
has made a start at that.

Are there email apps for Linux other than Thunderbird/Seamonkey and
Evolution that have calendar integration?

You might want to check out [1] ScheduleWorld for your syncing needs.
There are a lot of possibilities, for email, task lists, contacts, and
calendars.

Evo can do the automatic address-booking thing and lets you choose from
different mail servers / accounts for composition, etc.  I'm okay with
Evolution for now, but I wouldn't be using it if I wasn't using GNOME.
I do wish the priorities of the development process weren't so
monomaniacally focused on Exchange integration.  I don't see that
changing anytime soon. 

Or join with the borg and use gmail.  Resistance is futile.  One way or
another, you will be assimilated.

AFIAK, gnome-terminal has behaved that way ever since I started using
GNOME, which was about 2.10.  I wasn't aware one could turn off that
behavior, but then I only recently started making minor changes to
g-conf keys here and there.

The two clipboards is by design.  It is specified in a freedesktop
spec [1].  It was designed to unify the cut-and-paste behavior.  There
is the clipboard, which works with explicit cut-and-paste.  This is
familar to Windows and Mac users and mostly uses the same keybindings.
 There is the primary selection which is the currently selected text
which is pasted by middle mouse.

Gtk and Qt have implemented support for the clipboard and most modern
apps implement the standard.  Some apps, like OpenOffice, don't
implement the current selection probably because they come from a
world where there is only the clipboard.  Emacs is the one program
that behaves differently and uses the primary selection for
everything.  There has been some work done in making Emacs behave like
other apps and separate the selection/region from the clipboard [2].

So I switched to Sylpheed-Claws for my school mail client and found that 
nearly all of the features I would like are integrated.  I may use a 
separate calendaring system.  Undecided as of yet.

However, I do find that Sylpheed-Claws is unable to queue outgoing mail 
while Sylpheed did it just fine.  Configuration is identical to what it 
was before removing Sylpheed and installing Sylpheed-Claws.  Yet now I 
get:

Error
Could not queue message for sending.

I gave up on Evolution years ago, although I can't remember why at the
moment. I recently migrated from Firefox/Thunderbird to Seamonkey, and
that's worked out well for me.

I have very serious concerns about gmail ... privacy, security and
availability. I have an account, but I don't use it for anything "serious".

Yes and no.  The default profile handles how the new shell is started
up and can be
changed by editing the default profile (or any profile)  under "Title

I have been monitoring the up coming Ubuntu Live conference here in

paying the several hundreds of dollars to attend these presentations.  
Why is it so expensive to attend all three days? It seems like  
Portland has a very helpful *nix support group with this service

I can't say exactly what happens to the money, but do know that there
is no such thing as a free lunch. Sooner or later there will be a tab,
and someone has to pay it. So the "free" in "free and open source"
isn't really true. I'm sure Mark Shuttleworth wants Ubuntu to support
itself. He has many millions, but he can't keep sending out free CDs
without income. I imagine that Ubuntu Live is designed to break even at
least, and if it makes money, so much the better for Ubuntu. Moreover,
I happen to know that the Oregon Convention Center is the most
expensive real estate to rent per square foot in the state.

I'm not paying the hundred bucks - I'm just going to the exhibit hall.
But if the rest of it was of interest to me I sure wouldn't begrudge
them the money.

Subject: [PLUG] dhclient(?) providing it's own dhcp address?
Message-ID: <20070718054315.GA23075@gate.kl-ic.com>


Some weird behavior for DHCP.   Perhaps dhclient causing this:

Comcast has gone out a couple of times in the last three days, an
hour or two each time.  After it goes away, my firewall ("f") starts
doing the normal DHCP client thing, asking for a new IP address.
The funny thing is that it seems to get one, in the address space
of the internal network!

Of course, nothing routes, the TTL is about 10 seconds, and that
interface goes down and starts up again with the next IP address.
So the interface is assigned 192.168.31.2,  192.168.31.3,
192.168.31.4, and so forth (the name of the "31" subnet is changed
to protect the innocent ).

At first I was tearing my hair out, thinking that somebody was out
there on the local segment, impersonating my internal DHCP server
for nefarious purposes.  Then I suspected my own DHCP server, but
turning that off had no effect, and besides it only serves addresses
over a small range in the upper part of the local address space. 

So, I'm not sure what is doing the DHCP ACK on that interface;
I'm guessing that dhclient is talking to itself, and logging the
behavior to /var/log/messages in a misleading way:

  ...

Dear Ken,

Earlier this month (see the archives), there was a user group code
shared which reduces the expense of Ubuntu Live (all 3 days of sessions
and tutorials) for user group members (like all of us) to $100. I think
several of us are taking advantage.

Thanks,
Mike

Yeah, it sounds like your dhcp server is listening on the external
interface too.  I don't know what your whacky distribution does, but
on debian, there is a file /etc/default/dhcp3-server that specifies
INTERFACES on which the server listens.  It should not include the
interface that Comcast is on.  That variable is fed to dhcpd3 when it
starts up in /etc/init.d/dhcpd3-server.  My advice is to look at your
/etc/init.d/dhcpd<mumble> script and read the manpage and figure out
how your distribution does things.

   As John wrote, there's rent on the Convention Center. Usually, the
speakers -- at least the keynote speakers -- are paid an honorarium or
provided with transportation, lodging, and meals. There's paid staff who
plan, organize, schedule, and work at the meeting. And the entire show is a
profit-oriented business.

   If you look at the seminar/convention business you'll see that they're all
expensive. Trade show booths at mining trade association conventions cost
between $600-2,000 for a 10x10-foot space. Registration costs are usually
$350-700; one I'm going to in Vancouver, BC, will cost me US$1,100 for
registration. That's for two-and-a-half days.

   Professional speakers (who are most likely not part of the OS/UbuntuCON
show) are paid at least $3,000 per talk.

   So, attendees pay to cover all the costs and provide a profit. Also, in
the computer business world, most attendees are there on company expense and
businesses are always charged more than are individuals. That's why the user
group offer of $100 was made.

I will assume that the IP scope you are getting a lease on is 192.168.100.x

The cable modem itself is giving you lease, this is by design.  It
allows for internal troubleshooting so that techs can view modem
information.

This is standard on most cable modems.

Try going to 192.168.100.1 and see what you get.

I have a route in my firewall, that allows me to see this even when my
IP is being served by Comcast's DHCP server.

I don't have an answer, nor do I even know if there is one. But if

It doesn't do or say anything else?
Does the mail go into Sylpheed's outgoing queue at least?
Does Sylpheed retry?
Does your SMTP server need a specific sort of authentcation?
Does it want pop-before-send?

It's getting to be time to setup a mail gateway at the edge of my network to
sanitize stuff before it hits the company Exchange box. Originally I had
planned on setting it up using Sendmail, but I have had some recent exposure
to both Postfix and Exim, and they seem to be nice pieces of software and
are generally well respected online. The most attractive thing about them is
that they seem to "do the right thing" for the most, but maintain a fairly
good level of flexibility, without the configuration voodoo required by
Sendmail. As much as I like Sendmail's power, escaping from those arcane
texts is appealing. I did some looking about for comparisons among Sendmail,
Postfix, and Exim and the newest one I came upon was from 2003. I doubt very
much that conversation reflects the world as it is now. For any of you who
have used Postfix or Exim (or ideally both of those and Sendmail) in a
production or production-like environment I ask:

-How well do they do spam filtering in practice? I assume they operate in a
fashion similar to Sendmail milters. Does the quality of the available
filtering mechanisms compare to that of Sendmails?
-How "heavy" are they? Sendmail can process huge volumes of mail on
surprisingly low-powered hardware, even while doing a fair amount of
mail-munging.
-What's the maintenance experience like, say 6 months or a year after
installation? I don't want something I have to constantly poke. I already
have an Exchange box for that....

I'm also open to other suggestions, except Qmail. That looks more complex
than Sendmail, and I'm already familiar with Sendmail's weirdness. I know
that asking admins about MTAs is like asking coders about languages or
editors, so please keep the flaming to a minimum... :D

I prefer Postfix.  I have not done anything with Exim.

DON'T use Qmail.  It is not very well maintained and spam filtering is a 
nightmare.

There are a number of programs for spam filtering and anti-virus that work 
very well with Postfix.  The config files are very well documented and 
clear.  It is currently maintained.  I use it and I don't have to muck 
with it hardly ever.

My standard recipe:
 * Postfix
 * Amavisd-new
 * Spamassassin
 * ClamAV
 * Postgrey

Here is a fairly simple config to get you started.  Note there is no
SASL auth on this one (let me know if you need this).  I do have SSL in
this one, so you can create some keys/certs of your own, or comment that
stuff out.

BTW, for those out there that *loath* cyrus-sasl, dovecote does a fine
job now for handling SASL auth.  Even if you don't use it for IMAP it
will probably save some head smashing just for SASL.

I run Sendmail+SpamAssassin+ClamAV+TLS+AUTH and am pretty happy, so I 
suspect that Kris' recipe will serve you well.

Oh, my.  I learn something new every day.  The number they picked and
the number I picked was the same.

Yesterday, my local net was 192.168.100 , established long before the
cable modem arrived.  After an hour of relabelling and readdressing 
machines, it is now something else.   If I see .100, I will now know
what it is, and if I see the new number, I will go back to fretting 
about enemy action.

Thanks for the info!

While we're on the topic, here's my configs for using dovecot with

debian/ubuntu).

  -o smtpd_client_restrictions=permit_sasl_authenticated,reject

          # Assuming the default Postfix user and group
          user = postfix
          group = postfix
        }

I'm creating a flyer for PLUG. I have the pic that appears on the PLUG

Action pics showing someone speaking at a meeting would be good. Does
anyone have any pics we can use in the PLUG flyer? The more exciting,
the better. Any format is OK.

Yes, it has. It's been replaced by the 870 series,
which cost quite a bit more.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0707191546150.9831@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

    Replaced Slackware-11.0 with Xubuntu-7.04 on the ThinkPad 600E. It all
works, except wireless networking (which worked under Slackware with no
problems).

    Wired networking works, sound works (yea, team!!), and it even powers off
after logging out and shutting down the OS ... which it did not do under any
of the three prior linux distributions. So, we're happy with all that, but
must get the wireless networking up and running.

    I did a manual configuration; actually, the information was already in
there from the manual configuration of the wired network, and
/etc/networking/interfaces contains:

# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
address 192.168.55.5
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.55.4
# wireless-essid appl-ecosys.com
# wireless-key elviscostello

    Rebooting makes no difference. The link light on the Lucent Technologies
GOLD card is on, the interface is configured, but it's not running.

    I've looked at threads on the ubuntu fora, posted a request for help on
the xubuntu-users mail list, and am frustrated that this is being so
difficult to resolve. It's the last function to get working so I can mark
this project completed and get back to my business. I know there are several
experienced ubuntians here, so I would greatly appreciate your
recommendations on what to do.

TIA,

Rich

I don't know ubuntu very well, but those wireless clauses are
commented out.  Do you think that might be your problem?

Also, go to a terminal and type: "sudo iwconfig" for some additional

I've been using Ubuntu since the 'breezy' release, and I have never  
been able to get wireless networking to work on any built-in  
wireless. I have only been able to get it to work using a 7+ year old  
Linksys wireless PCI card. I'd like to have any Linux distro figure  
out the wireless networking issue so that with the initial installation.

Russell,

   I commented them out because it wasn't working when they were uncommented,
either.

   Had looked at that yesterday, but did not see anything other than the
proper ESSID name. Just changed that and restarted networking but no
difference. I'll try a reboot ... and it makes no difference.

Ken,

   There is nothing built in to this 1999 vintage ThinkPad. Network cards are
of the PCMCIA variety.

OK. Then a Linksys PCMCIA card should work without any additional  
configuration work. My Linksys PCMCIA card is:

Model No: WPC11 ver. 3

I believe I have an extra one if you want to try it.

Ken,

   Thank you very much for your offer. The Lucent GOLD card worked fine with
Slackware so there's no reason it would not work with Xubuntu. There's a
configuration problem somewhere, and I am totally unfamiliar with the Debian
family of linuxes to know where to look. The files in /etc/network/ look OK,
the configuration for the wired connection -- eth0 -- is the same as for the
wireless -- eth1 -- and it works without any issues at all.

I'm out of date, but...

Re-PC for used parts.  PC-Fixx closed down, but looks like Seattle Micro
is still going.  A1 Best appears to be the up-and-coming chain.

Is that place on 2nd Ave S. across from Sears^WSoDo^WStarbucks still
around?  What about that place at the bottom of Stone Way?

I am using a thinkpad t21 with edubuntu 7.04. out of
the box it would not work at all with my pcmcia
linksys card, but with my DLink dwl-g650 it worked
like a charm, no mods, and even worked with my
wpa2-psk network. 

sorry I dont have the model of the linksys card handy,
although I know its a couple years old...

Rick,

Have you tried installing the base Ubuntu Linux distro? I notice you  
installed Xubuntu on your laptop. Is there a reason why you chose  
Xubuntu over Ubuntu? I am not familiar with Xubuntu, but I have  
installed Ubuntu on a very old (10 year old) laptop just fine and it  
detected the Linksys wireless card.

   What I gather from you and Ken is that the intersect of hardware and
distribution will work with some cards and not others. How interesting. I
thought each hardware system needed a specific wireless card, or one from a
selected list. For example, my 3Com card that works on the Sony Vaio is
totally unrecognized by the ThinkPad. I had no idea that a laptop/pcmcia
card working with one distribution would not work with another.

Thanks,

Rich

Ken,

   The Xubuntu subspecies uses Xfce as the desktop/window manager, rather
than Gnome or KDE. Underneath they're all the same.

Well, I'm not a believer that the "underneath" working of the OS of  
Xubuntu and Ubuntu are the same. The Ubuntu Linux disto has several  
flavors (i.e., Ubuntu, Xubunt, Kubuntu, Edubutu); just like RedHat,  
SUSE, Mandrake, etc. has several flavors of their Linux distros.  
Microsoft and Apple do the same thing.

I know that Xfce is just another desktop/widow manager. However,  
there are several flavors of X out there being used by the various  
Linux distros.

Is there a specific reason or need why you want to run/use the Xfce  
desktop/window manager? Have you tried Gnome or KDE for a desktop/ 
windows manager?

Pretty much, except that Gnome should have better Dbus support, and,
more importlantly, Ubuntu with Gnome has Network-Manager, which usually
makes wi-fi Just Work.

Mind, you may have to remove all the interface configuration if you want
to use Network-Manager.

BTW, why Xubuntu?

Sorry you missed last Sunday's Linux Clinic,

Ken,

   No, I hadn't found that.

   The Lucent Gold is not listed at all. The only one mentioning Orinoco does
not appear to work as well as do others.

   Now I'm in the market for a new PCMCIA wireless card for that laptop.

Thanks,

Rich

   I've been futzing with network-manager. Every time the system boots, I get
multiple instances (increasing each time) of nm-applet, and I cannot call a
halt to this.

   Because it uses Xfce.

Ken,

   Wow! Certain brands/models work, others don't. Some work with specific
releases but not with others. So, I'm now in the hunt for a PCMCIA card
known to work with 7.04.

Thanks very much,

Rich

   Where the hardware compatibility table for wireless networking cards and
ubuntu distributions refers to 'chipset/driver,' am I correct in assuming
it's the PCMCIA card's chipset being referenced, and not the computer's?

   If so, it appears that the D-Link DWL-G650 works with 7.04.

Anyone else directed to freelotto.com by the main fedoraproject.org site?

It's not free, I decide to trust an ad that I was the 10,000th visitor to
the site and the winner of a sizable chunk of change until it asked me for
a credit card.  Question is, why is fedoraproject.org running such a
questionable ad?  What does taking a credit card number have to do with
no purchase necessary?

   I am sending this to you via an Orinoco Silver wireless card in a
Thinkpad 600. It is running Debian testing with a 2.6.15 kernel. The Orinoco
cards have always been well supported.  Are you sure that there is not some
configuration problem. One of the things i believe the Orinoco does not
support is the newer encryption methods like WPA.  Does iwconfig really show
the interface as eth1? If iwconfig is showing your access point, then the
card must be working.  What does ifup eth1  do?

I have a Thinkpad T23 and a Gold card (not sure it's lucent, but probably)
that works fine w/ 7.04. I also have a $15 Fry's house-brand b/g card that
"just works". I've never needed to do any futzing with them on any version
of Ubuntu I've used with them. Under 7.04, the pre-installed network manager
tool for gnome has always just done the trick. With the gold card, I do
sometimes have to insert, remove, re-insert to get it to actually come up.

Bill,

   The Orinoco Gold worked before. The laptop is running the 2.6.20.5 kernel.

   If there's a configuation problem, I have not been able to identify it. We
don't use WPA or WEP. It's a static IP address on each host here, and
there's a small, but finite chance that someone outside might try to access
the 'Net or our network via the WAP.

   Both iwconfig and ifconfig show the interface as eth1. It appears that the
access point is recognized.

   ifup eth1 does nothing. The interface is configured but not running, and
running ifdown/ifup makes no difference.

   Hence, my frustration. I don't want to buy another card and have the same
issues.

Thanks,

Rich

Yes, Linux had not fully captured the wireless hardware thing yet.

Ah, sounds like you've tried to /help/ it.  Be careful: you're used to
distros that require work to set things up, Ubuntoid distros assume

OK, do I get 19 more questions, then?  
Animal, vegetable or mineral?  
Why XFCE?

Dude, I *know* you're not that gullible.  And I *also* know you've been

URL?  I see no ads on fedoraproject.org.

If you're browsing from a spyware-infested Windows PC or through an
ad-insert proxy (e.g. MetroFi), there's your problem.

Ditto.  No ads on that site.  If you see ads someone in the middle is inserting them.

Aaron,

   No, I've not tried to help it, only tried to get the wireless networking
going.

   Not necessarily. My reason for replacing Slackware with Xubuntu is to
reduce the need for my attention on this laptop. I want it to work with no
maintenance on my part.

   One of the major reasons I like Slackware is that the upgrades were fast
and painless and once up and running, it needs no maintenance other than the
security patches that are infrequent. So, the computers are just what I want
them to be: a means to an end, not an end in themselves.

> OK, do I get 19 more questions, then?

   Nope. Would take too long and not result in anything useful to either of
us. One hint: Xfce is based on CDE, not anything Microsoft has ever put out.

   GUI environments are like text editors, scripting languages, and
distributions. There's a plethora available because everyone has his own
preferences.

Another ditto- I disabled AdBlock+ and no ads.
I didn't think fedoraproject.org would use ads.

Perhaps time for OP to run SpyBot, Ad-Aware, etc?

Though, speaking of man-in-the-middle inserting ads, I've heard that some
ISPs are starting to do this.
Maybe OP need to check your ISP and see if they have started doing this.

IMHO ISP's that do this need to have a server rack beaten over their head a
few times.

For those who don't read it, UserFriendly webcomic had an arc on this very

Beating people over the head with server racks...? 
Ah, no.  Good story arc, though.

Incidentally, I've been working with transparent proxies lately.
They can be surprisingly easy to set up, delightfully sneaky, and, when
sold preloaded on small cheap rackmounts, shockingly lucrative.

I have created a PLUG flyer. Much thanks to Keith, Dave, Aaron and
spike for input and critique. I am going to print it tomorrow. However,
I have to guess at quantity. Note to previous attendees, how many do
you think would be an appropriate quantity for the booth at OSCON?

Can't append an attachment to an e-mail to the list, but if anyone
wants to see it, I will be happy to send a PDF off-list.

I need to figure out what days/times we need to man the booth at OSCON.
I can be there any time, but after a few hours I'd like a break. Do we
have any others willing to share the booth baby-sitting?

We should have signs about the Clinic. I can produce those, but what
about background signs about PLUG? Does anyone have a large format
printer that can make a large sign? I mean, like a meter or two. All it
has to say is "PLUG."

When is the thing, anyway? What hours does it need to be attended?

I'm looking for some Visual/WYSIWYG tools to develop web apps for a  
LAMP plaftorm/environment. I currently use Gedit to right my HTML  
pages and PHP scripts and SQL scripts. About 6 months ago, I started  
a project to develop a Web database app for a Microsoft platform  
using Visual Studio, ASP.Net 2.0 and SQL Server. I'm quite impressed  
with the Microsoft's Visual Studio. Does anyone now of a similar web  
development tool that can be used for the LAMP platform?

Please send me the flyer as a PDF to:

I'd like to see it. I may also be able to attend the booth if I know  
what time slots are needed to be filled.

Ken,

   There's a CSS editor called bluefish, and IBM's huge Eclipse system. I've
used the latter to design databases and write C code, and I imagine that it
has plugins for everything, including warming left over pizza.

Thank you for the additional information. I am more of a development  
manager with VB programming (with ASP.Net 2.0 and SQL Server), PHP,  
Perl and PostgreSQL/MySQL skills. I do know some C++, but it is very,  
very minimal and several years old. Also, my application background  
is more in the healthcare setting. I hope you can find some help  
through PLUG. Good luck!

Free as in freedom: KDevelop and Quanta Plus, assuming you've drunk the
KDE Koolaid. Rich mentioned Bluefish; screem and nvu are two others.

Non-free but well worth the money IMHO: ActiveState's Komodo. Komodo's
main features are

* cross-platform: Windows, Linux, and I think both Mac and Solaris as well
* Handles all major scripting languages: Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl/Tk, PHP
* code completion, syntax coloring, folding, debugger interface and lots
of other IDE goodies
* repository synchronization with CVS and Subversion and I think a
couple of others
* some HTML/CSS stuff I have not explored yet, plus Rails IDE tools I
also haven't explored

The only thing Komodo *won't* do that KDevelop *will* do is C/C++. Since
you're planning on PHP, that shouldn't matter.

I recently decided to buy Komodo for Ruby development (non-Rails at the
moment). It was a tough choice -- KDevelop/Quanta Plus will do
everything Komodo will do and is free. But it more or less locks you
into KDE and Qt, and essentially runs only on Linux.

The clincher was when I downloaded Komodo for a trial and it
automatically synced with my RubyForge project repositories with no
grief. I couldn't get KDevelop's syncs to work for some reason. So I
went with Komodo, and in fact bought a full Perl Development Kit
subscription.

Rich, I have a buddy who works on IMB's DB2 project. I think I'll  
contact him to see if he has any knowledge about their Eclipse  
system. What I like about Microsoft's Visual Studio is that it has a  
large tool-set of very standard/common web features (i.e., table  
genearator, query building to external databases and formatting).  
Microsoft also has a 'free' version of Visual Studio called "Visual  
Studio 2005 Express", and it has some very nice features to get a web  
database app up and running.

/var/log/messages does not seem to recognize that new hardware is present.

   Before I run mkfs.ext3 on the drive, I need to identify it and mount it.
How do I identify a clean drive, and how do I specify a filesystem type when
I mount it?

Rich,

Try running "fdisk -l" to see if the new drive shows up.
Once you have drive device (e.g. /dev/sd? ) you can use fdisk to setup the
partition table.
Then you run mkfs.ext on the a partition on the drive.

I thought you had to run mkfs on an unmounted drive. And once you have
a filesystem on it, then it should be recognized. I think.

Can you access other hardware from the USB port that the external  
hard drive is connecting through? Try popping in a USB thumb drive  
and see if that is detected. Some external hard drives have drivers  
that need to be installed; they will come with a CD/DVD installation  
disk which is most likely for Windows and/or Mac OS's.

Hey! I use Personal Telco when I'm at the Ugly Mug (Sellwood  
neighborhood). I wish I would of known of this event also. I believe  
Personal Telco provides an excellent service! I'm helping some  
friends with a yard sale today (even though it feels like Hawaii in  
Portland today).

   That didn't show me anything; should have mentioned that I tried it. I
think it would be found if on an internal bus.

open the lid/screen of the laptop. Has anyone had this problem and  
successfully fixed it?

   No, this guy arrived by itself in a sealed plastic bag. I was going to put
it in my Toshiba Portege, but finally decided that however much I like that
small, light notebook, it's too slow and has too little RAM (96M max) to be
really useful. So, I'll use the drive for backup, extra storage, and
transporting applications.

Thanks,

Rich

   My ThinkPad needed a screen/inverter transplant. If you want a solid
repair shop, go to Northwest Computer Support in south Beaverton (at least,
that's where I think it is). They do excellent work. Highly recommended.

If the drive isn't being recognized, it could be a jumper issue (very
tiny jumpers).  For example, I can connect my Travelstar laptop drive
via an external laptop connection, but only if it's jumpered as master,
which is no jumper.  You may want to try Master, Slave, CS, and none.

Another issue could be that the drive is not getting enough power over
USB.  That is, you may have to plug is some kind of power supply, which
should have come with the enclosure.

Let us know what you discover.

- Robert

This sounds like the external hard-drive can't communicate with your  
computer; hence, it sounds like a driver issue. Have you tried  
powering down both the computer and external hard drive. Then power  
them up together? I know this may sound a bit simplistic.

Is this a new external hard drive? Usually they come with a CD/DVD  
for use with Windows/Mac computers.

Is it a new hard drive or an external hard drive that you are  
connecting through a USB port on your computer? I'm a bit confused by  
your correspondence below.

Dear Rich, 

If recognized by a HAL capable system, it should show up in the output
to the lsusb command. FYI, here's my output from a 120GB external drive
I have (connected to device 002)

# lsusb
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0c0b:b001 Dura Micro, Inc. (Acomdata)
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000

The ID would be all zeros if the drive weren't recognized. If that's
your situation, I think Ken's suggestion applies - try a USB key, and
run lsusb again.

Thanks,
Mike

Plugging in an external LCD monitor works, but I want to be able to  
go to my favorite java house (The Ugly Mug) and not have to carry  
along an external LDD monitor ;)

   This is a new 2.5" hard drive I was going to use in a notebook. It is in
an enclosure I bought last week at ENU.

   I think it may be a power issue. I just hooked up the oversize IBM
Travelstar to the Bytecc adapter, and it was seen immediately. I can mount
/dev/sda1, 2, or 3 and read/write to those filesystems.

   I'll try the new drive on this adapter.

   No jumper. Master drive.

   This little enclosure did not come with a power supply; the Bytecc --
which works with naked drives -- does.

OK. I think I understand. You are replacing your hard drive in a  
notebook computer. Your comments about never powering down a a server/ 
workstation caught me off-guard as I'm not familiar with using  
notbook computers as servers or workstations. It sounds like you are  
on the right track with the power issue.

   Insufficient power out of that USB port. On the Bytecc adapter I created a
single partition and am now creating the filesystem.

   So, I'll need to find a wallwart that will provide power to the case. I
know it's 5V, but I'll have to check the drive label and the Bytecc case to
see what amperage it wants.

   Kewel! Now I have an extra 50G (40G Fujitsu and 10G IBM) I can carry
around with me. That's a heck of a lot of storage!

When I had a similar problem, I was advised that the problem was likely due to a 
faulty inverter (power supply for the lamp tube) or the lamp tube was dead. 
Inverters are available, and so are lamps, but replacing the latter is a task 
not to be taken on by the faint of heart or large of fingers.  Mine was the lamp 
(replacing the inverter did not fix it), so it sits unused. (The lamp can be as 
small as 1/16 inch diameter and as long as the screen, with soldered ends 
encased in silicone rubber.)

You can determine if it is something other than these two by shining a bright 
flashlight at the screen at an oblique angle and looking for text.  If you see 
any, it is one of the two above.  If you can detect none (look really 
carefully), it could be the video.

Thank you for the input. My screen flickers when I move the lid/ 
screen back and forth (e.g., open to close postions). The screen  
ususally does not work, but sometimes it does. I think it may be a  
fault inverter. Have you replaced and inverter? Is it easier than  
trying to replace a lamp tube?

I don't think it is the video, because I can plug in an external  
monitor and all works fine.

****July 24 PDX.rb presents FOSCON III: Really Radical Ruby, 7:30pm
http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/216872/

The Portland Ruby Brigade will be hosting an evening of wide-ranging
talks about Ruby. This year the focus is on people doing strange things
with Ruby. Strange, of course, is anything just a bit outside the
expected. If you've created a new Ruby-based interface for hacking your
brand new internet-enabled phone (rPhone anyone?) or composed your
latest bit of metaprogramming magic, we'd love to hear about it.

Using the lightning talk idea you'll get 10 minutes (give or take a few)
to talk. Make it especially interesting and they might even give you an
extra minute or two. Send an email to tlockney+foscon at gmail.com in
advance if you are interested in presenting or show up early on the 24th
to sign up for a possible slot.

Replacing the inverter is not too bad, but you should get the repair 
instructions for your model, and follow the step-by-step procedures, unless you 
are familiar with taking the screen apart.  You will also need the instructions 
to determine which part number you need.  Go slowly and carefully, and keep 
track of all the little screws.

I bought a used inverter, replaced it, but no change.  That is how I concluded 
that the lamp is the problem. (IBM/Lenovo has the manuals on line.) The part 
number I got is 11J8851 FRU 11J9622 EC F00760.  If you find that this is the 
part you need, you are welcome to it.

It's really pretty easy to take a laptop apart.  There are just a lot of 
screws and sometimes of varying length.  Personally it sounds like the 
plug for the screen has come loose, or the screen's wire harness has 
been twisted too many times from opening and closing.  You never 
mentioned the brand/model, but on most laptops you can simply pry the 
plastic panel above the keyboard off the laptop.  Most are held there 
via snap in.  And the monitor plug should be accessible from there.  If 
the screen is bad though, it's not worth fixing.  The price of a used 
display would be far more than the machine is worth.

  They can have my Orinoco Gold when they pry it from my cold, dead,
laptop!  It is a great 802.11b card.

  There is stable Linux support for the Hermes chipset.  The card has
great receiver sensitivity.  It also has an external antenna jack is
for those days when you *really* need to find an open access port.

   I know, I know. But, for whatever the reason, two days of struggle and the
card is still not working with xubuntu. I have no idea how to identify the
source of the problem. The orinoco drivers are loaded. The link light comes
on. The interface (eth1) is configured, but it's not RUNNING.

   I don't know enough to look further and determine why a card that worked
out of the box (except it did not come in a box, I bought it from a local
vendor at the PLUG wireless clinic at Riverdale HS) no longer works with the
new distribution.

   If there is a set of steps of things to check, I need to have someone tell
me what that is. I can perform each step and report the results to someone
who knows how to interpret them.

   Inverter wasn't difficult in the ThinkPad, but the one I bought over the
Web was faulty.

   Not the video drivers, but the LCD screen itself.

   I ended up having NCS replace both the LCD screen and the inverter (with
one that actually works), and that's what it needed. In the interim, I
plugged in an external monitor so we could see what the system was doing.

Rich,

The first thing I look at when I am having wireless connection problems is
the output of the following four things
iwconfig
ifconfig
route -n
iptables --list


if you could run those and send us the output, we would have somewhere to
begin.

Rich,

The first thing I look at when I am having wireless connection problems is
the output of the following four things
iwconfig
ifconfig
route -n
iptables --list


if you could run those and send us the output, we would have somewhere to
begin.

Oh, and I forgot  dns diagnostics.
what does resolv.conf    say
and what happens when you ping the gateway
ping 192.168.0.1   (or whatever the ip address of your access point is)
as opposed to just pinging something further away
ping yahoo.com

It is a Maxstation laptop. They are a local Portland company. I have  
two of them. One is 10 years old and this one is about 5-7 years old.  
I could take it to them, but I thought I would see if I could fix it  
myself.

Bill,

   I have the first three, not the last. I've looked at them over and over,
but they don't change. :-) I ran 'ifconfig -a' and 'route -n' with the wired
connection up, then swapped cards, restarted the network, and ran iwconfig.

   /etc/resolv.conf is correct; so are /etc/hosts, /etc/hosts.allow,
/etc/hosts.deny, and /etc/hosts.equiv.

   With the wired card I can ping internally and externally. With the
wireless card I cannot ping anything: 'Network is unreachable.'

This falls into the "almost definitely won't work, but might be worth a 
try" category; it's not uncommon for our router (a cheap Netgear) to just 
refuse to work with specific machines on our local network until we 
power-cycle the router. From the machine side, everything looks ok, but it 
simply won't connect.  After the power-cycle (and, sometimes, restarting 
the network on the affected machine) everthing works again. We curse the 
router, and move on.

Sorry I can't offer more. Wireless networking on Linux has always seemed 
uncomfortably close to a black art to me.

Is this ifconfig from the wireless or the wired?  What is it with the
wireless?
The output of iwconfig indicates to me that your wireless card is working
just fine, otherwise how would it know the ESSID of your access point.  The
next step in the process is actually associating with that access point.
Ifconfig will reveal whether or not that worked.

   Or, the MAC? This is why I've been going in circles. All indications are
that the wireless networking should be good, but it's not.

   And how to I do this if I cannot ping or access any host on the LAN? As

Have you tried rebooting with the wireless card in? Once in a rare
while my [x|k|]ubuntu install will give me issues re: wifi, and the
only way I've found (at least, the easiest way so far) to get it
working again is a full reboot.

Rogan,

   That was the first thing I did. Since there seemed to be no difference
between a reboot and a network restart I've opted for the shorter time of
the latter.

Thanks,

   Just to confirm, I tried again just now. Still no joy.

Rich, 

There is no way to tell remotely what is wrong with your wireless as you
have made such a muddle of describing the situation and symptoms.

Please start over, by plugging in the wireless card and providing the
following information in the following order:

a) the output of "lspcmcia -v".  This will tell us the chipset in your
   card and the driver that is being used.

b) the output of "iwconfig".  This will tell us the state of your
   wireless association.  Without association, no traffic will move.

c) the output of "ifconfig -a"

d) the output of "route -n"

e) ping -n -c 1 4.2.2.2

f) ping -c 1 www.google.com

I'd prefer unadulterated output immediately below the command so I can
see it in context.  If you want to keep some of that private, email it
directly to me.  Feel free to provide additional explanatory text, but
please don't omit what I have specifically asked for.  It would go a
lot faster to just give me a shell on the box, but that sounds
impractical.

If a single USB port doesn't provide enough power, is there a device
that "joins" two USB ports into one?  That is, it will draw power from
both USB ports.

Just curious.

There certainly does exist such a cable. I can say that with great
certitude because I am looking at one on my desk as I type this. It has
two standard USB plugs on one end, and the other end has a mini-USB
plug. It came with a portable USB drive that takes the mini-USB plug.

Hey John,

The flyer looked great,  I would like a digital copy so I can send it on to 
someone at Lincoln High School, to get his opinion as to what would make the 
most sense to get high school geeks involved.

BTW, the final "e" missing from "plunge" in the next-to-last line of the text. 
And I still think you should add "3rd" in front of "Sundays 1-5 PM" on the 
Clinic poster.

OSCON is this week - July 23-27, 2007 at the Oregon Convention Center.
See http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2007/ for details.
Altho the conference costs significant dollars, everyone can get into
the community meetings, and the BOFs, and  the vender exhibits on
Wednesday and Thursday.  This also includes OSCAMP (http://oscamp.org)
which also runs on Wednesday and Thursday.

PLUG will have a booth at OSCON on Wednesday and Thursday.
John Jason Jordan <johnxj at comcast.net> has produced a great
flyer for PLUG and will be at the booth on Wednesday to get
things started, but...

We definitely need help running the booth.
We don't expect John to spend all of his time at the booth.
So, email John and volunteer to help for a couple hours.
or drop by the booth and volunteer.

AND AS AN ADDED BONUS!!
Art Mann and Silicon Mechanics (http://www.siliconmechanics.com)
got us one conference pass which is good for all the pay sessions on
Wednesday and Thursday.
We are going to share this pass.
We will keep a sign up list for the pass at the PLUG booth (#424).
Sign up on a first come, first serve basis.
You can only sign up for one session at a time and please volunteer to
spend some time working at the PLUG booth if you use the pass.
Also, be prompt about getting the pass back to the PLUG booth as
soon as your session is over, so the next person can get to their
session on time.
On the other hand, please take advantage of this opportunity and use
the pass.  It is absolutely great of Silicon Mechanics to do this for us.

   I don't know where the 169.254.0.0 network came from, but I cannot
successfully run 'route,' even as root. The system will not let me delete
that route or add a loopback route.

   My Google search for "SIOCADDRT invalid argument" produced 11,200 hits.
Most of the first couple of pages go back to the 1.5.3 kernel, are from
1998-2001, and seem to be debian-specific. But, I've not found a solution.

   How, on a Ubuntu box, can I run 'route add -net ...' and 'route del ...'?

Thanks,

Rich

OK, the hours for the booth are:

	Wednesday 10 am to 5 pm
		Reception 6 to 7:30 pm
	Thursday 10 am to 5 pm

I have the flyers in my possession, plus I made a big-ass sign to hang
on the backdrop (about a meter wide and half a meter high). It says
"PLUG" in 1060 points and underneath "Portland Linux/Unix Group" in
smaller type so that it is the same width as "PLUG." I am going to the
Ubuntu exhibit today, where I hope to pick up a large box of CDs for
the Clinic, and we can also have them on our table. (Will we have a
table?)

Since I have everything in my possession (except the business cards -
Keith take note), I should start by taking the first shift Wednesday
morning. Therefore y'all can count on me being there starting at 10 am
on Wednesday. 

William Morita e-mailed me and offered to spend four hours Wednesday
afternoon. Therefore, between the two of us we have the first session
covered.

I will volunteer to do another shift Thursday afternoon until closing.
That way I can take the sign and unused materials back home with me.

What remains then is the Reception thing Wednesday evening, and
Thursday morning. If others want to volunteer for the times already
covered, please do so. Having two people makes us look even more
impressive, gives us someone to talk to, and makes it easy for one to
leave for bathroom breaks and stuff.

   Can't. Get the same 'Destination host unreachable' for any host on the
network or externally.

Rich,
   This is definitely a routing problem. Does it work with the wired
connection?
Also, in /etc/network/interfaces, get rid of these two lines

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

This is very likely what is adding that extra 169.254.0.0 route and could be
the cause of confusion. At least we know they are unncessary because you
don't have an eth0 interface. More likely it is a routing problem in your
router, but delete those lines, restart your network and see if that helps.

Rich,

I got my wireless card to work on my laptop. I had to do some searching
around to in the Ubuntu Forums, and I ended up having to download an
updated driver/firmware for my Broadcom BCM4318 wireless adapter. I also
had to install ndiswrapper. Have you tried using ndiswrapper? I don't
remember if we talked about this.

At today's Ubuntu Live Conference, I attended a presenation about Laptop
support for Ubuntu. Matthew Garrett gave an excellent presentation of
all the numerous issues Ubuntu (and other Linux distros) have supporting
laptops. Much of it seems very much hardware related. After his
presentation, he helped me troubleshoot my problem. He was very helpful.

BTW, he is moving out here to Portland (from the UK) after he graduates
college. I'm hoping he will get active in PLUG when he arrives!

Maybe you should try dhcp.  My guess is that you've got something
boogered in your network configuration.

   Yes. No problems at all.

   They're not there. Here is the current /etc/network/interfaces (with the
ESSID removed, but it's correct):

# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

iface eth1 inet static
address 192.168.55.5
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.55.4
wireless-essid <name>

auto eth1

   On ubuntu fora I've seen references to an ath0 interface, but I've never
come across that before.

   The router has not changed since the same laptop worked wirelessly with
other distributions.

   Thank you for thinking about the situation, Russell. Static IP addresses
have worked here for a decade, and the only thing that's changed recently is
the distribution on the ThinkPad. Wired connection works, which leads me to
think the problem is at the intersection of the wireless card and the
distribution.

   I'll look for information on ndiswrappers and learn what those are.

I am coming into this discussion late...

What chipset is this using?  There is a problem with some of the current 
broadcom chipsets and later kernels.  (Some revisions do not have enough 
memory to support the revision 4 firmware and have to use the older 
version.  The new driver wants the version 4 firmware, not the older 
version 3 firmware.  The pci ids point to the new driver.)

Rich,
   Forget the ndiswrappers, they are for chipsets whose internals are not
open/understood so windows dll's are used to get around this problem. Your
chipset is a well understood chipset and does not need ndiswrappers. I think
you should at least temporarily try dhcp as Russel suggested. It would
clarify where the problem is.

Bill,

   If worse comes to worst, I'll remove xubuntu and return to Slackware. I'm
sure that I can get the sound working again with this distribution, and that
was the only real reason to change. Slackware-12.0 comes with Xfce-4.4 so I
can make her desktop look the same as it now does. And, we subscribers will
get our box of disks Real Soon Now.

Which is good, because this problem has nothing to do with the driver.
Your driver is *fine*.

The ath0 interface is created by madwifi for atheros chipset wireless

Not a broadcom.  This is a driver that has worked forever and is still
working, as evidenced by the iwconfig output.  It is associated fine.

There is some kind of problem with network configuration, or possibly
a iptables issue.  I suggested dhcp (assuming there is a dhcp server
on the network) to make sure the network configuration was sane.

Rich, what is the output from the following commands?

  iptables -v -L -t filter
  iptables -v -L -t nat
  iptables -v -L -t mangle

   There are no iptables set up on that laptop.

   I just installed the KDE Wireless Assistant
             <http://packages.debian.org/unstable/kde/wlassistant>
at Steve's recommendation.

   Running it throws a bunch of errors and suggests the card's radio is not
on. As there's time -- probably next week -- these error messages should
provide much more insight and details.

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

I had some trouble with the KDE Wireless Assistant under Kubuntu. Have 
you tried wifi-radar? It seemed to configure the network card better (I 
have a HP DV6253 CL - AMD Dual Core laptop). I thought my problem was a 
new rev of the chipset, but it could be the configuration of the 
wireless card /DHCP.

If everything else is working, you might try that.

Tim

Tim,

   Thank you. We have a project deadline we're meeting, so this will have to
be continued next week. In the meantime, the wired connection works
flawlessly so she'll continue to use that. What an interesting experience
this has been!

Message-ID: <918477.63907.qm@web50610.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

I would like to try this technology. I have DSL delivered through a DHCP router, a computer capable enough to be a server, and other hardware that I would like to become clients. I expect to use Lenny as the OS.

PXES is a live client CD, for those hoping to accomplish the job with relatively little effort. I have thought of trying that. The only difficulty seems to be that XDMCP must be enabled on the server: it is disabled by default on most distros due to security issues. Enabling it is distro-specific, so I would like to know how it is done in Debian.

The other method is, of course, LTSP. I have found outlines of how to set this up, but not as specific as I would like. Can someone point me to such information?

Anyone know what such a cable/adapter is called so that I can google for

I'm not a ubuntu person but I have seen these same types of issues on
debian when Network-Manager was installed and was controlling (or trying
to control) the interfaces.

I usually remove network-manager* on the systems I have that are set up
with static IP addresses but actually find it very handy on my laptops
which I use to connect to various networks both wired and wireless.

This may not be your problem but it is something else to check.

You can get a USB hub that add additional USB ports from one USB port on
your computer. The hub has its own power supply. Belkin makes one.

Sure.  But I'm looking for something with mobility.  Now, a USB hub that
is battery powered would be cool.  Same with a battery powered
wired/wireless switch/router.  But I haven't seen either of those.

That is an option, but a simple cable that has an extra connector on
one end to get power out of two ports would be cheaper and may be all
that Rober needs.

As for what they are called, I don't know. I do know that USB cables
come in a bewildering variety. There are several connector types, each
of which comes in male and female, plus specialty types like a USB to
iPod cable. They also come in different lengths and some have features
like "retractable," and so on.

I usually start looking on eBay to see what sellers there are calling
them. I've also seen them at Fry's, although I don't know if they have
a dual connector one with the specific type of connectors you need.

There might be some tidbits you could extract from the K12LTSP or Edubuntu
documentation. In fact, if you start with one of those, the LTSP setup is
more or less done and you get a basically turn-key setup. Have you dug
around the documentation on the official LTSP site, rather than relying
google? I seem to recall finding some very good info there when I was first
setting up LTSP stuff which was not well indexed and therefor not showing up
in my google digging.

Not in my experience. Every machine I've used it on ever it shows up as an
ethX device, usually eth1.

Cannot successfully run route as in "command not found" or it doesn't like
the syntax? The "route" command should be installed by default, it has been
on every Ubuntu box I've worked on.


> How, on a Ubuntu box, can I run 'route add -net ...' and 'route del ...'?
The way I do it on modern (2.6.x systems with iproute2 installed (which
Ubuntu is)) I use the following syntax:

ip route add 192.168.0.0/24 via 10.0.0.1

to add static routes. To make them persistent, I adjust the
/etc/network/interfaces file so that the section for the appropriate
interface looks like the following:

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
up route add -net 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 172.16.1.70
down route del -net 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 172.16.1.70

That above adds the static route to my VPN gateway for my colo'd machines to
my routing table when I boot. You'll surely notice that the syntax is like
that of the older "route" command. I'm sure it could be done with either the
new or old syntax.

An interface using ndiswrapper would, as would many other wireless devices.
Orinoco ones do not. The device names will vary from driver to driver.
Atheros ones show up as "athX" for instance. On Solaris, even "standard"
ethernet interfaces are all named differently, depending on the manufacturer
of the device.

As it should be :)
BSD does this as well. It's very nice to know which NIC is which based
on the name.

Subject: [PLUG] SystemRescueCd partimage problem
Message-ID: <930d8d390707241556t107231a9i97e70b464027e8eb@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone have any experience using partimage on the SystemRescueCd
distribution to clone Win XP? Any other free/ fast solutions you may
suggest for this situation?
Here's my situation:
Need to clone 25 computers with image of XP sp2
Booted latest SystemRescueCd and used partimage to create a image file
on another disk.
Boot SystemRescueCd on new computer and restored to HD
When trying to boot System hangs right away with a cursor in the top
left corner.
Partition flag is set right.
If I use gpartd to just copy from one partition on one disk to another
it works fine.
System is Dell Optiplex 745 w/ SATA HD and combo drive.

Thanks in advace for any help.

Mark

It's been a while, but do you need to re-write the mbr?  (This used to
be accomplished by running fdisk /MBR from a dos boot disk, if that
helps any.)

Did you ever try dhcp instead of static network configuration?

Rich,

I don't think your iptables is the source of your problem. I don't think
you are running a static IP address on your laptop; or are you? Are you
using your laptop to tjust access our wireless router/hub so that you
can access the internet?

That is an ambigous reply.  Just because you didn't manually set up
any iptables rules doesn't mean that there are none.  For example,
ubuntu might have helpfully set some up for you.  I don't use it so I
don't know what it does.  Did you actually run those commands and get
nothing back or did you assume the response based on having not
setting anything up.  I can't tell from what you wrote which is the
case.

And as for the static v. dhcp, I don't mean to suggest that you
*should* do one or the other, just that as a diagnostic it would be
(at least potentially) useful to try.

   If there's time next week I'll look at this. I don't see the relevance,
but that's because I am not highly experienced in wireless networking.

It isn't on the Fedora site directly.  It's on the linked to 
home page for bittorrent.  Dumb mistake on my part.  So why
is bittorent's home page running an incredibly stupid ad for 
freelotto.com?

As far as gullibility, if Fedora's community trusts the site, why
shouldn't I?  No, I wasn't browsing on a Windows box at the time.
No, I did not give the jokers a credit card number, not that joke
is the right word.  Maybe freelotto.com ads are the ISP's fault,
the one hosting the linked to bittorrent site.

How can ads be stopped on the client side anyways?  They should be
stopped on the server side.  It wouldn't hurt for the Net to 
experience a bit of cyber policing for once.

IMO, if you are going to waste my time on a legitimate web site 
with a come on that says I've won something, you better give it 
to me.  Cough it up jerk is my attitude.  Well, I wouldn't 
actually go that far, but it certainly feels good to say I would.

Again, my mistake, the problem was on the linked to bittorent site
and not http://fedoraproject.org itself.

Gambling and sexual enhancement ads seem to be ubiquitous on the
Net.  As far as gambling, which can be done legitimately, it's
hard to tell what's real and what isn't short of going to an 
actual casino.

"No purchase necessary, you've won;" you don't take a credit card 
number from me even if I would give you one.

Indeed!  I ran into some old OSDL co-workers who've since been hired by
Canonical, fondled an OpenMoko, caught up with IEEE ComSoc gossip and
even spotted the mighty Maddog.

I haven't seen any adds in... ages.

Personally, I'm glad adds are a source of revenue for sites like
bittorrent.com.  Thanks for helping fund these projects!

Subject: [PLUG] Setting default screen size
Message-ID: <46A8C7A1.6020709@dslnorthwest.net>

Hi,

I am running Kubuntu 7.04, code named Feisty Fawn.

New monitor (Samsung 216BW), old card (Creative Labs SB0400 Audigy2 Value).  I 
intend to get a new card with digital output that can run the monitor in its 
native resolution of 1680 x 1050, but until I get that card...

The first time booting after connecting the monitor, I was able to set the 
screen to 1400 x 1050 in System Settings.  On subsequent boots System Settings 
will not change the monitor from 1024 x 768 (the resolution on boot).

If I enter xrandr -s 0, the resolution sets appropriately to 1400 x 1050, but 
reverts to 1024 x 768 on boot.

xrandr man page says "The default size is the first size specified in the list."

I would like to have the machine come up in 1400 x 1050.  I would appreciate any 
ideas.

Thanks.

Isn't that a sound card?

Your xorg.conf says you've got a "NVIDIA Corporation NV18 [GeForce4 MX
440 AGP 8x]".

Denis,

First, I think you meant to say the monitor was a 206BW or a 226BW,
which are the 20" and 22" versions from Samsung. Both do a native 1680
x 1050. I don't think there is a 216BW.

I just got a 206BW and had issues similar to yours. I think I can help,
but I'm at OSCON manning the PLUG booth until 5:00. Tonight I'll have
time to review what I did to get Ubuntu to recognize the video card and
the monitor. It's running flawlessly now in 1680 x 1050, and I have
options for lesser resolutions as well. I had to leave the booth to get
to a net connection because the Convention Center has deliberately made
wireless unusable in the exhibit hall (so they can charge for it). For
a computer convention, that is lame beyond words, but more about that
later.

John,
See:
http://www.samsung.com/ca/products/monitor/lcd_widescreen/ls22mevsfvxaa.asp

But I appreciate your help.

The first problem is that the default size seems to be buried somewhere I know 
not of.

The second problem is trying to get to the native resolution with the present 
card, (which was tactfully point out to me is NVIDIA Corporation NV18 [GeForce4 
MX 440 AGP 8x])

The third problem is to locate a digital output video card which meet Keith's 
requirement of not draining Bonneville.

-Denis

Tons of fun, and PLUG did very well. I arrived with 320 flyers and a
quick count tells me that I have ~130 left. Hundreds of people stopped
at our booth, and 190 found us sufficiently interesting that they took
a flyer. Even more took just a business card. Much thanks to Dave
Mandel, Keith Lofstrom, Bill Morita and Tracey Mintz for helping man
the booth, and special thanks to Dave for arranging it.

See y'all at the next meeting, August 2. I'll bring some of our new
flyers.

Subject: [PLUG] Troubleshooting Adobe Reader
Message-ID: <20070727213158.bf247c8f.johnxj@comcast.net>

Adobe Reader has been giving me fits ever since I started using Linux,
but now I have the ear of a Linux specialist in the acrobat division of
Adobe. She is quite well versed in Linux; that is, she gave me some
command line stuff to try that evidenced a serious knowledge of Linux.
Hopefully I will finally be able to track down what is wrong. 

[Side comment, I will soon be a beta tester for 8.1/Linux. I can say
that because I haven't signed the NDA yet. Later my lips will be sealed
with that special glue that commercial software vendors are so good at
compounding.] 

There are two problems: 

1) In the print dialog window the drop-down box where the printers that
you have installed in CUPS are supposed to be listed just shows
"custom" and no other options. To the right of this is a text box where
you can enter an lp/lpr command. Since you cannot select the printer
with the drop-down box, the only way to specify the printer is by
carefully typing its name in the text box (and tab doesn't work there).
I have seven printers installed, so not only is this a PITA, but it
also means that many options of my printers are unavailable - no way to
specify the option at the command line with lp or lpr.

2) When you install the latest version (7.0.9) the Help > About dialog
window says it is 7.0.8. At first I thought this might be due to a file
on my computer left over from when I was running 7.0.8, but the Help >
About window says 7.0.8 on my brand new desktop machine that has never
had anything but 7.0.9 installed on it. I tried installing it from
Synaptic (it's in one of the Ubuntu extra repositories), and also by
the tarball that you can download from Adobe, but same results.

Problem (2) is trivial, unless it turns out to be symptomatic of a
deeper problem. The real issue for me is problem (1).

Adobe says that the printers should be listed in a drop-down box for
all versions of Reader starting with 7.0.5. They finally admitted it
did not do so for me only after I e-mailed them a screenshot of the
print dialog window. (Thanks Dave; I saved your cool trick in my
CheatSheet file.)

I have asked about this on the Ubuntu amd64 forums. So far about 75
people have read the post, but there are no responses.

Also, I am fully aware of kpdf and other PDF viewers. Just trust me
that they will not do what I need to do; the reasons are too long to go
into here. Moreover, I should add that the printers I have installed in
CUPS definitely appear in a drop-down box in the print dialog window
for all other applications. Adobe Reader is the only application where
they do not. And one more hint that might be significant - if I install
Adobe Reader 7.0.5 or later for Windows under WINE, its print dialog
box also fails to list the printers installed in CUPS.

Here is what y'all can help me with:

I only have Ubuntu Feisty amd64. I would like to know if any of you who
have Reader 7.0.5 or later installed do see a drop-down box for your
printers in the print dialog window. If so, please tell me which distro
and architecture. Evidently it is working properly for most people,
therefore my first suspicion is that it is a 64-bit kernel problem. My
second suspicion is that it is an Ubuntu issue. Or maybe part of each.
I'm hoping that with more data I can get a handle on what might be
causing the problem.

My Adobe help says 7.08.  I get a drop-down box (although I have only one printer).

Use Ad-block.  The problem is they are being injected on the ISP side, 
and the original site may not have had the ad, or /that/ ad at all:

And who will do this?  You? ;)  Better to not click the ads.  It's like 
those lame SPAM emails that purposely misspell, or use horrible graphics 
or unrelated paragraphs of gibberish to throw off the filters. People 
wonder who would fall for this?  And the answer is that enough must or 
it wouldn't be worth it.  Well, you just validated why it's worth it to 
run those lame ads.

I've used the DLink 10/100 PCI card.  Works fine.  I think it sells for 
< $20 at Best Buy.  Pretty much any NIC that's available from the main 
stores, and not Gigabit (1000) should work with no issues.  If nothing 
else, run down to Free Geek, if you live in Portland.  If not, pretty 
much any 10/100 PCI NIC will work just fine.

If you're anywhere near Free Geek, they have a box full of them. They
sell the 10/100 ones for $6 and they will definitely work with Linux.
They're open at 11 to 7 and are closed on Monday.

Subject: [PLUG] PLUG distributed library
Message-ID: <20070729194616.GA11196@gate.kl-ic.com>


Folks:

We have a BUNCH of new and recent books to start a PLUG Library
with.  At OSCON, the Prentiss-Hall folks offered us most of their
display stock, so they wouldn't have to haul it home.  We parlayed
that into books from Apress and others.  So we have about 50 books
to loan around.  I suggest we make a very informal distributed
library out of these and other donations.

Other distributed libraries have been tried, and failed.  Perhaps
they were too complicated.  Here's a simpler possibility:


                The PLUG/Wiki Distributed Library

The basic idea is, there is no "central library", all books are in
the custody of individual members.  We keep track of where they are
with a wiki and a library mailing list.  Each book has a wiki page,
with a description of the book and the person who has it, and who
wants it next.  Members can keep books as long as they want, until
somebody else wants it;  then a two week waiting period begins, and
the next person can pick it up after that (either at a meeting, or
by post, or by arranging to meet).   Or some other rules.  People
who can't follow simple rules are excluded.

Most wikis keep past revisions, so past history won't disappear;  
while this might be a privacy issue for some subjects, for Linux
books this is a plus - if a person has questions, they can ask
the previous users of the book.

I would like the library wiki to be private, and require individual
logins and passwords - I would want to keep email addresses and 
perhaps home/work neighborhoods on there to facilitate transfers,
and I don't want that information going public.  Perhaps someone
can install a more elaborate request/answer web program that does
some of the tracking and communicating, but basic Wiki technology
and some discipline should work well enough.

Again, this isn't for everybody who says they are a member - let's
do it through personal contacts and reputation instead.  Over
time, that will include almost everyone who makes the effort to
participate and behave responsibly.

While we can seed the library with the books we got at OSCON, we
can certainly donate more to the pool.  I have a lot of Linux books
that I don't use much.  I worry a little about books getting abused
or going missing, but we can identify vandals and theives fairly
quickly if we have the history, and exclude them from the library -
this isn't for everybody, just those we trust to behave like adults. 
We can keep track of books with title and ISBN, then number multiple
copies.  We can point the  ISBNs at the Amazon page for more
description;  perhaps we can get some money off clickthroughs and
use that to buy more books.

John Jordan suggests:

So in time we might be able to borrow this piece of code, though to
start with, we just use click and paste.  All we need is a wiki with
individual passwords.  I could donate space on one of my wikis, but
I prefer to do this with a MoinMoin wiki on the PLUG server.  More
about that in another post.

Message-ID: <20070729195703.GA11246@gate.kl-ic.com>


PLUG needs a wiki.  During OSCON week, I talked with Geoff Burling
and Wil Cooley (who maintain our static website) and python-based
MoinMoin looks like our best option.  Wil already maintains a
MoinMoin Wiki for Personaltelco, so this minimizes the work involved.

There will probably be some immutable pages - general information
and the like - but plenty of personal content and discussion, I 
hope.  With a wiki, we could maintain information on past and future
meetings a lot more easily.

In another post, I suggested setting up a separate wiki for a PLUG
distributed library - that might involve a password-protected area,
since there would be some private information there.  Perhaps we
can figure out a way to accomplish what we need without the private 
information on the web, so we can start out with a simple open wiki
and see where it goes.

Uh, not that I know of.  Wil doesn't even have an account on the box
where the PTP wiki runs (though he could if he was going to
volunteer!).  But PTP does use MoinMoin.  I don't have a wide
experience of wiki software, but MoinMoin seems to work well from my
perspective.

It's not worth it for the spammer unless they make money or waste
your time, depending on what they're after.

I am pro investigate Internet abusers and enforce the law with
enough talented people to make a difference.

I haven't validated anything by my actions.  I believed bittorent
to be a legit site running legit ads.  There are legitimate
promotions.   I knew the ad wasn't legit when I got redirected
to a site that asked for a credit card number.  I'm not against
legitimate advertising to help fund a site.

If viruses are churning out spam, that problem, not the symptoms of
it, needs to be addressed.  ISP's have to do more and perhaps more needs
to be done at the routers where the Net crosses into other countries.

I'm tired of fighting stuff that is supposedly from France, etcetera.
It doesn't do much good to build an IP blacklist.  Even selective
greylisting is not working for me.

Spamassassin isn't adequately classifying the spam I'm getting.
How can a spam email get through spamassassin as non spam when the
content is identical to one caught earlier???  The spam score is
less then 5, but it's the same email.  I'm putting anything with
a 0 < spam_score < 5 into a secondary spam folder.  Some legit
email ends up in that folder.

                             MEETING ANNOUNCEMENT

                        The Portland Linux/Unix Group
                                  will meet
                          7 PM Thursday Aug 2, 2007
                                      at
                          Portland State University
                                      in
                            Smith Memorial Center
                                   Room 327
                           On the block bounded by
       SW Montgomery, SW Broadway (7th), SW Harrison, and SW Park (9th)

      *******************************************************************

                                 PRESENTATION

                                 An Overview
                                    of the
                      Oregon Technology Business Center
                                     and
                                     more

                                      by
                                 Steve Morris
                              <smorris at otbc.org>

      I don't have a very good description of this presentation, but
      Steve said he would start with an overall update on OTBC and
      then continue with one of his specialized presentations.
      If you have a particular interest, email him and let him know.
      There is a good chance he will orient the presentation in
      that direction.

      *******************************************************************

          Agenda:

              7:00 - 7:30  Business
                   We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects

                   PLUG's monthly hands on clinics, PLUG for Education,
                   etc.

                   Also, there are changes coming for LinuxFund.
                   I will spend a few minutes discussing these.

I second that.
PLUG needs a wiki.
I haven't use MoinMoin, but any wiki I don't have to run is good with me.
At least, as long as it is good software and well ran by someone else.

I personally, have used MediaWiki and have been fairly happy with it.
I have also used plone for interactive "near-wiki" like sites and had good
success with it.  Plone has wiki modules available, but I haven't had
personal experience with these.

However, as I said above any decent wiki I don't have to run is good with me.

I'm not a big fan of Wiki; however, it does provide some nice
features/tools. I would like to hear out PLUG would use a Wiki.

There are also wiki services:

PBWiki: http://pbwiki.com/
JotSpot: http://www.jot.com/  which is being integrated into Google

If folks have a relationship with FreeGeek, they use MediaWiki.

I've been very happy with MediaWiki, and it's been relatively easy to
add extensions to, as well as having a reasonable syntax (IMO).  I've
also used trac, twiki, cliki, phpwiki, and a handful of others, and
MediaWiki stands out in comparison. In particular I've found it much
easier to format pages with MediaWiki, primarily because you can edit
subsections of a page independently of the entire page. The template
system is also very cool.

In any case, I also support the idea of a PLUG wiki, and I strongly
suggest MediaWiki.

I would check into it's security history.  I don't want to see our servers 
get rooted because of sloppy code.

My other concern with an "open wiki" is wiki spam.  If we do not have some 
barrier to posting, we are going to spend a lot of time removing crap from 
bots.

Anither thing that we need is a ical calender for PLUG events.

Subject: [PLUG] rj45 to bnc balun?
Message-ID: <46AE5ABC.905@acm.org>

Done some searching using Google but most of the references are about 
using CAT 5 to transmit video.  I need to connected a computer with a 
RJ45 connected to a coax cable network drop.  A very small office but a 
complete re-wire (CAT 5) is a last choice.
   Of course a PCI card that connects to a COAX network that will work 
with Vista would be an OK solution.  Yup, I dealing with MS stuff 
because there is a Linux server in the office, they are friends, and the 
Windows 98 machine _died_.

There are a few Windows (DOS box) applications or I'd stick a Linux 
desktop in.

Anyone have manufacturers and/or model suggestions for a BNC to RJ45/CAT 
5 adapter?


TIA,
Rod

My personal wiki got a lot of wiki spam before I required accounts to
edit, now it gets virtually none.  (Creating an account only takes
about 45 seconds, and doesn't even have a captcha, but it was enough
to deter almost all spammers.)
Granted, the PLUG wiki would have more of a 'net presence than mine
does.. but it would also have more people who care about it.

Re: JotSpot -- I used it at work for abotu 6 months, and it was a
horrible mess.  The last straw was when we started loosing content
because of bugs in the locking mechanisms that were supposed to
prevent concurrent modification of the same content.  I could go on
and on... there were many, many less serious annoyances (Such as some
pages that you could only edit in xml, or only edit in WYSIWYG, or...)

The RSS feeds were useless/unreliable, no email notification, etc...
Google has a lot of work ahead of them to make jot a competitive
product, IMO.

Message-ID: <104339.99051.qm@web50612.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Sorry about the crummy subject line, but I'm considering the full spectrum of options for a few people to tap the power of one high-end computer simultaneously. There is a product called BeTwin for Windows that allows two to four people to use the same computer simultaneously by connecting an extra set of peripherals for each added user. Has anything similar been attempted for Linux?

I am impressed by RDP, a protocol used by thin clients to communicate with a server. In the past, this has meant a Windows server with terminal services, but the XRDP project is bringing these capabilities to Linux servers. (If someone on this list is already using it, I would be particularly interested in their comments.)

If I understand correctly, you need to connect a computer with a 
twisted pair interface(10/100/1000BaseT) to an existing 
thinnet(10Base2) network.  Probably your easiest solution is to get 
your hands on an old hub that has both twisted pair and coax 
connections.  You can likely find what you need at Freegeek or ebay. 
If you are really desperate, I can loan you one.

"Any wiki I don't have to run is good with me" echoes my feelings. And
I am more than happy to let those who understand wiki software decide
what to use and how to use it.

I would like to suggest that this might be a good thing to discuss at
our meeting this Thursday. 

Meanwhile, I'm going to start on making a list of the books we scored
at OSCON.

A MediaWiki instance I administer got spammed while requiring accounts
for edits. I had to add a CAPTCHA (the MediaWiki reCAPTCHA extension).

Having done Moin also, I think I like it better (no DB).

   How about several dozen or hundreds of users on the same server or two?

   Look at LTSP, the Linux Terminal Server Project. The education industry
version, K12LTSP, is installed at a number of Oregon schools/districts.

Do you mean like this:

"Microsoft Surface, Watch Your Back! Here Comes MPX for X Server on Linux"

http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/4072/microsoft_surface_watch

or this:

"Build a Six-headed, Six-user Linux System"

X11 and later VNC have been doing this long before RDP.  Most people
think of X11 as a windowing system, but perhaps it's better thought of
as a communications protocol for windowing.

That said, what interests me about XRDP is that in theory I can have
existing Windows clients connect to a Linux desktop that's on a remote
server so I don't have to install or dual boot Linux on those machines.
 Also, RDP is fast.

Just don't expect any speed out of it.  You will still get 10mb or less.

If you want anything faster, you will need to rewire to something from 
this century.  (Which you should do anyways.)

Windows uses the RDP protocol for their Remote Desktop app. It is nice
in that it provides 128-bit encryption and other "thin-client" features.
I believe Gnome-RDP provides the same/similar of features.

While my favorite wiki right now is kwiki, Wil Cooley was the one
who suggested Moin, because (1) he already runs an instance (oops,
not PTP) and (2) it is his server.  He wanted to avoid kwiki because
of the extra work and the extra vulnerability.  I imagine that 
MediaWiki (using PHP, and needing a database) is in the same camp.

Rule # 1: the person doing the work gets first choice.  This is
also known as the "Little Red Hen" rule.

Moin does have features for user logins and passwords, IIRC.  I
don't believe it has captcha, which makes it a tad more vulnerable. 
I don't know whether it has a "revert and erase all traces" function.  

That said, I could run a kwiki on my site ( at "plugwiki.klic.com" )
or someone else could run a mediawiki at their site.  But the URL
looks funny, and I would rather see everything together on one site.

A PLUG Wiki will not need suggestions;  it will need many volunteers
to add content and clean up the occasional messes.  Participation,
not pontification.  Who is ready to help?

I have server, space, disk and plenty of bandwidth if necessary. Otherwise I
am up for volunteering on adding/maintaining a wiki for the group.

I got disguested with the site when I ran into an anti Linux, "Windows is
more reliable," ad.

I disagree with using multiple email addresses to fight spam.  I
honestly think that http://www.mailchannels.com is on the wrong
track.  More email addresses means more entry points which means
more spam.

Anti spam services that can effectively find the source and shut
it down are what is needed.

A side question, why are hydrogen based electric generators so horribly
expensive?  It was in a linked article...

The funny thing about the anti Linux FUD is that I listened to the clip
on a rock solid Linux system.

Unless you are hiring hit men, this cannot be done by a non-government 
force.  Due to the international nature of the net, it will take 
governments all over the globe cooperating to shut these bastards down. 
Doing that, without drifting over to the dark side and using it as an 
excuse to shut down its critics, will be an interesting challenge.  (i.e. 
not bloody likely.)

Because hydrogen has a low energy density.  For that reason, few people 
use them.

Unless they use some MS DRM, it is the easiest way to do it.

Sorry for being dense, but 'multiple people ... using same computer 
simultaneously...' just sounds like, well, Linux, running across a 
network.  We've got Linux boxes at work, multiple people log in 
simultaneously all the time. 

We also have Windows boxes, where multiple simultaneous logins are a great 
big pain, and I can see why you'd need something special to do this.  But 
I'm not sure what you're looking for that Linux doesn't do out of the box.

Something like this?

Expensive but if your re-wire job will be more than $220 per drop then
it is worth it.
If some of the computers are close together you can use a hub or a
switch at the local
point to reduce costs.

Multiple email addresses doesn't necessarily mean multiple accounts.  I 
use aliases for most of the companies I deal with regularly and also 
with one-off's.  For example, I sold a car a while ago with the Auto 
Trader and of course, they wanted my email address.  So I made a quick 
alias of trader at mydomain.com and gave them that.  I got their 
confirmation email and they never new my real address.  After the card 
sold I just removed the alias.  I do this for my bank, CC cards, and 
others as well.  It works great unless you need to reply occasionally, 
then they will see your real email address.  And you will find out right 
away if you start getting spam on one of those aliases exactly who sold 
you out.

10Mb and half duplex!  And with topology that can brake the whole 
network in half with a single wiring fault?  I'll take the re-wire.  Or 
better yet, just go wireless if the office is that small.  Larry 
mentioned something about $220/drop.  I'm thinking ouch to that.  It 
shouldn't be anywhere near that unless the wall and ceilings are 
horrible for running cable.  But again, if this is so small, go wireless.

Actually I saw a much smaller unit but never followed it down to pricing.

I haven't asked lately the guy who did their original wiring what he 
charges now.  Just saw his truck drive by yesterday.  I might have to 
get back into contact.

This was one of my considerations.  There is going to be another new 
computer sitting out on the COAX also so this is starting to look like 
the best solution.

I do the same thing.

I like knowing I have control over the email address, if I provide a company
an email address and I start getting spam.  I can remove the alias and the
spam stops and the company that I provided the address to looses the ability
to contact me.

The lack of network is probably one of the more notable points.  It's a 
single computer, with more than one keyboard/monitor/mouse hooked up to 
it.  There is potential for huge cost savings.

It's more than simultaneous logins.  It's multiple simultaneous 
real-time working environments.  While more than one person can be 
logged into an XP desktop, only one person can actually use it at a time.

You could probably compare it better to terminal clients connecting to a 
terminal server, but again, with the lack of the network or thin client 
being there.

Imagine on your linux desktop that one of your virtual desktop spaces 
can be used by another person sitting next to you while you use your 
own, all at once.  It's like that.

And how would we borrow these books?

I have started a job to create a web database application using  
Microsoft Visual Web Developer 2005 Express Edition. All of the tools  
are free to download from the Microsoft website (i.e., Visual Web

Express is a scaled-down version of MS SQL Server, but the  
development tool/environment is pretty slick. I would like to hear of

I am sure it will be on the agenda.

The four MySql books at the end are in my possession; Keith has the
rest. If anyone wants to borrow a book, let us know and we can bring it
to the meeting. Until the wiki gets figured out we can just keep track
on (gasp!) paper.

This list would benefit from amazon links :) (or any place with more
info about the books.)  I wish I still lived in stumptown.. I have a
couple books I almost never use (Linux Device Drivers, programming
linux games, Unix Powertools) that might be good additions.  (that,
and I'm deathly curious about the contents of the Linux Phrasebook ;)

Anyone in the Seattle area interested in setting up something like this?

I evaluated it for suitability as a training tool for the company I work
for. This was.... maybe six months ago? If you want to get into Visual
Studio / .Net-based web development, it lowers the bar for learning
substantially. Be aware though that you can't really do anything "real" with
it, unless they've changed things substantially since I last looked at it.
None of the programs will (would?) allow connections from remote machines,
so it's really only usable as a personal sandbox, and even within that
context it's been substantially cut down. A number of the tricks and add-ons
that are available for VS just don't work in Express. If you decide you want
to do anything "real" with what you build, you'll have to have the
appropriate server software available to host it.

Most of the web applications my company creates are done with C# in .Net
from within Visual Studio. It seems to be a nice development environment in
that it does a lot of abstraction and automates a lot of stuff. However,
I've seen several instances where that bit our developers because that
automation failed to do what they want, and didn't understand what was
happening under the covers well enough to dig through it quickly, and the
feedback that they got back from the system was vague at best.

If you have a good reason reason to be getting into web development in the
MS/.NET world, the Studio Express is a good way to go. However, if you
aren't necessarily tied to that stack and just want to learn web
programming, there are a number of other languages / development
environments that do not have the same financial costs associated with them
when you want to use them "for real". Personally, I'm a big fan of
Turbogears.

Oh, I also wanted to mention that you might want to ask this question on the
discuss at itproforum.org mailing list. That is a technology group in Eugene
that is not Linux-focused, so you might get more responses from people with
direct experience there. The list has hardly any traffic on it, so I can't
speak to the likelihood of your getting an answer, nor to the quality, but
you question might pull someone out of the woodwork.

Just for the record, I happen to be one of the founders of the group.

The first thing that comes to mind for me is also LTSP, as someone else
mentioned. I've done a couple of the large Oregon school installations that
Rich mentioned. Check out k12ltsp.org and educuntu.org for some nice
turn-key-ish solutions. They are education focused, but don't let that put
you off. The only thing that makes them so is their default selection of
applications. If you have specific questions about it, let me know.

As far as the multiple users directly connected to one computer scenario,
which sounds like it's more what you are looking for, there are a couple of
commercial solutions as well as the "roll your own" setup that Robert linked
to. One is Ncomputing (http://www.ncomputing.com/ncomputing/index.php),
another is at http://userful.com/ . There is a third one I've looked at, but
I can't recall what it was off the top of my head. Both of those options
have their strengths and weaknesses. I've not deployed either, but I
evaluated them before going with LTSP installations.

Thank you for the referral to itproforum.org. I posted my question  
there and subscribed to the email list server. I quite impressed with  
MS Visual Web Developer 2005 in that my development time is  
significantly reduced compared to developing and deploying a web  
database app on a LAMP platform. Is this Microsoft's approach to open- 
source? Thoughts?

Uh, no.

This is an "attempt" by microsoft to grab beginning programmers before they
Learn to actually program.

Amazon links has been mentioned before, and will probably get to the
list eventually. What Keith and I have done is really just a quick and
dirty beginning. Keith typed out the ISBN numbers for all the books he
had and that he would contribute and e-mailed the list to me. I added
ISBN numbers for four that I had. I found that Alexandria Book Catalog
program can read a text file containing ISBN numbers, go out to the web
and find cover pictures, titles and authors, and import them into a
folder in Alexandria. From there it can export the folder as html. It
took Alexandria maybe 60 seconds to do this. Then I e-mailed the html
stuff to Keith and he set it up on a temporary website of his own.
That's as far as it has progressed, but it will get fancier as we
figure out the rest of the wiki stuff.

I don't think we will have a record keeping system set up in time
for the Thursday meeting, sadly.  I would like to use a section of
the PLUG wiki, when that is set up.  Hopefully it will be set up
before the Clinic on the 19th or Advanced topics on the 20th, 
though if it is set up sooner, we can meet somewhere before
those dates.

My first thoughts for a distributed library were geared towards
privacy, but my second thoughts are that we do the transfers
openly, based on wiki names, and figure out some way to get
contact information from one to another, later.  I figure my
email address is well and truly spread all over the internet,
so keeping the distributed library "private" does not help.
Most of the rest of you are equally exposed.


Here's my idea of the plan, subject to modification by all you 
smart folk:

There is no central book repository - all books stay in circulation,
and are held onto until the next patron wants them.  The library
"database" is hand edited text pages on the PLUG wiki.  Transfers
are negotiated by email or phone.

On the wiki is a page named "Library", with some subject headings
that point to subject heading pages that we rearrange over time.  
Those subject heading pages point to individual book pages, with
basic info, perhaps a cover photo, pointers to information at
Amazon, and most importantly the checkout list - who has the book,
when they got it, and who wants the book next.  All books will
eventually be in the hands of library patrons.

Patrons will have individual pages on the wiki, under their real
names, with as much or as little information as they want to put
there, but at least enough to make contacting them possible, and
some idea of where they are and when they are available to make
trades.  Most of the transfer negotiation will be off the list.

The wiki will store revision history, so books will always leave a
trail of past borrowers.  If we find that some individuals damage
books or keep them too long, or act like jerks, we don't give them
any more.

If certain books are wanted only by one individual, then the book will
stay with that individual for a long time.  If Alice has a book, and
Bob wants it next, then we should agree on  a schedule for how long
Alice can keep it.  I think Alice should be able to keep a book for a
minimum of two months if she wants, and keep the book for up to a
month after Bob's request.  So if Alice gets the book on March 1, and
Bob requests it on March 2, she can keep it until May 1 (two months). 
If Alice gets the book on March 1, and Bob requests it on June 15, she
can keep it until July 15 (1 month after request).  However, people
that cut each other slack - give up books after 2 weeks, or tolerate
a 5 week delay to get one - will earn valuable Bonus Points (tm).

If certain books are very popular, then people who buy more copies
and donate them will also earn Bonus Points; we make special efforts
to help them get what they want at other times.

I would like to limit this to people who can get to the meetings,
because that is a good place to trade them back and forth.  But folks
that are willing to pick up and deliver at other times are also
welcome.  Some of our members are transportation limited; so taking
books out to Troutdale or Forest Grove then expecting others to travel
there to pick them up or deliver them earns Penalty Points.  

This is somewhat like friends trading books with friends, but using a
Wiki to make it easier.  I don't want to trade books with jerks.  I
especially want to trade books with friends that are good at helping
and sharing.  So there are two rules:

1) Don't be a jerk (this includes whining about other jerks).
2) Put in extra effort to help other friends/patrons.  Be generous.

Again, we don't have the wiki set up yet, and until it is, keeping
track of where books are, and who gets the contended items first,
will be difficult.

As snarky as Bill's comment is, it's not entirely far from the truth, as I
see it anyway. I've seen Windows programmers called "application
assemblers", and again, that is often not far from the truth. By making the
learning curve so shallow at the beginning, the MS stack attracts novices,
and very quickly empowers them by enabling them to do things that are "hard"
by plugging together pre-built widgets. However, once there isn't a widget
for something, they start to flounder. But of course, they're already
heavily invested in this stack or career path, or what have you. Some
actually learn how to build their own stuff, but in the (arguably) common
case, they find someone else who has built that widget, and buy it from them
in the form of some sort of toolkit or API pack or what have you. The ones
that choose to learn to build their own stuff have a very hard road ahead of
them. Because they've been so coddled and have developed so few low-level
skills, relative to a programmer on another platform, that progressing
further up the curve is harder than it would have been. I see the learning
curve on the MS stack as being somewhat exponential, whereas other platforms
seem to be closer to linear.

Of course there are legitimately talented programmers using the MS stack,
but I'd say that the ratio there is substantially smaller than on other
platforms. Of course, I have no statistics to back this up, it's just based
on my perception of living everyday amongst nearly equal parts Linux and
Windows worlds, with a bit of OSX thrown in every few days.

But back to your comment on it being "their approach to open-source". I
assume you mean "approach" as a method to prevent people from embracing a
non-MS stack. I'd say they design their products to be easy to do simple
things with. All of their products. However, by emphasising this, they make
harder things harder than they need to be, and really hard things virtually
impossible. That is what I see as the real long-term consequence of using
the MS stack. Again, it's the exponential curve. I think all of this would
be the case, open source movement or not. That's just their strategy, and it
has served them well. In the Linux world, there are a lot of tools and
frameworks that are reaching maturity (some would call them mature) that
enable this ease of entry. The difference here is that the guts aren't
hidden away nearly as much, so the far end of that learning curve doesn't
spike upward.

The publisher's booths at OSCON didn't have many Perl or PostgreSQL
books.  They had a LOT of Ruby stuff.  We left most of that. 
O'Reilly didn't give us anything, and they are by far the premiere
Perl publisher.  The Powell's display  was doing a brisk business in
Perl books.  Perhaps the publishers saw no need to promote such popular
items in the exhibits area, just the odd stuff they want to unload.

OTOH, there are probably TONS of Perl books in author's
basements/garages/attics around here (hint hint) so the PLUG library
is unlikely to go lacking for long.  I am not willing to donate any
of MY Perl books to the PLUG library - they get used far too often.
