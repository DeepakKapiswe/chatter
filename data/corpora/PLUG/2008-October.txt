Conclusion:

It appears that the problem was ownership of /home/rsteff/.config/Google 
and /home/rsteff/.config/Google/GoogleEarthPlus.conf; each showed up as 
root:root. Changing the ownership of /home/rsteff/.config/Google to 
rsteff:rsteff and effectively deleting 
/home/rsteff/.config/Google/GoogleEarthPlus.conf (I just renamed it, 
after changing its ownership) seem to be what was needed. Google Earth 
now starts and runs from the Applications > Internet menu, and I can fly 
to various addresses.

A shortened story of How I reached that conclusion follows. The short 
short version is that strace lead to a permissions problem which showed 
the ownership problem.

Traceroute? I'd need to know where to have it look. I don't imagine it 
would be at the Google Earth web site, earth.google.com. Trace route 
only reveals my own machine, my router, and one hop in Seattle (9

I tried strace with only -o as an option. I got a file with 49356 lines, 
so I won't post the whole thing, here. There were a lot of entries 
stating that there was "no such file or directory." In most of them 
(all?), it was sub directories that do not exist. The filename in 
question was eventually found in another sub directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
stat64("/home/rsteff/.config/Google/GoogleEarthPlus.conf", 
{st_mode=S_IFREG|0600, st_size=676, ...}) = 0
open("/home/rsteff/.config/Google/GoogleEarthPlus.conf", 
O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

/home/rsteff/.config/Google and 
/home/rsteff/.config/Google/GoogleEarthPlus.conf both were owned by 
root. I changed them to rsteff:rsteff and started up GE. I got an error 
message box (but didn't write it down :-| -- something about not being 
able to find a file related to root, and that it would create one) but 
the problem remains.

I'm a little confused about why there is a GoogleEarthPlus.conf because 
1) I'm not running GEPlus, and 2) a little later there is also this:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
stat64("/usr/lib/googleearth/Google.conf", 0xbffb4630) = -1 ENOENT (No 
such file or directory)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Such a file still does not exist. I renamed the .conf file, on the guess 
that the program would create a new one. It turns out that my guess was 
correct.

Conclusion:

It appears that the problem was ownership of /home/rsteff/.config/Google 
and /home/rsteff/.config/Google/GoogleEarthPlus.conf. Changing the 
ownership of /home/rsteff/.config/Google and effectively deleting 
/home/rsteff/.config/Google/GoogleEarthPlus.conf seem to be what was needed.

Thanks for the introduction to strace. There remains much I don't know 
about it, but what I do know I can use in the future.

This information is all broadcast by your browser: when I visit that
site, it lists my ip, browser config, etc...

It's no different than looking into a mirror -- the wall didn't
somehow steal a live video feed of your face :)

The web site should have a privacy policy somewhere that details what
(if anything) they do with that information.  Most places discard it
excepting for the standard log files.  Since this instance is in a
signature on a post, it's probably not even apparent to the person who
posted.

Michael,

If it bothers you, Firefox allows you to change its User Agent 
advertisement. Google for "firefox change user agent". You can do it 
manually via the general.useragent.override option or, more easily, 
install an extension that will do it for you.

Also, choosing the About Firefox menu option (wherever it lives on 
your system) will show you the default user agent settings. In my 
case, it's "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; 
rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092414 Firefox/3.0.3" -- which obviously gives 
everyone a pretty good idea of my workstation platform. :-)

of course, changing your UA will often lock you out of sites that are
too fancy and demand that your browser be among the approved list, as
i'm sure you've already experienced even with your real firefox user
agent string.  making it something totally fabricated can break many
sites--often, for no good reason, but that's not much consolation when
they don't work.  stealing the UA of another popular browser might
yield slightly better results, but will likely result in a different
group of broken sites as well.  yay for web standards, boo for
browsers and page-writers that don't play nice.

"Fingerprint" is perhaps a fairly appropriate metaphor for what's going 
on here, as a person quite literally leaves their fingerprints whenever 
they use their fingers to touch things (unless they bother to wear 
gloves all the time).

So, for example, a restaurant actually collects fingerprints off of 
patron's glasses constantly....
...but, in general, while restaurants do collect those fingerprints, 
they often destroy them fairly rapidly, by washing the glasses.

If this bothers a person, they may choose to wear gloves (along with 
other measures to avoid leaving personal identifiers, such as bringing 
one's own utensils, shaving all body hair off to reduce tissue shedding, 
drinking through a straw that they keep with them, making sure not to 
use unsecured bathrooms, wearing a mask or altering their face to trip 
up facial-recognition scanners, and speaking through a voice alteration 
device (or not talking)).... or they can simply avoid restaurants which 
are known for collecting and divulging data about their patrons?

Subject: [PLUG] Samba between Ubuntu and Win98
Message-ID: <48E6535E.8000601@comcast.net>

Moving on to the next issue...

I have a couple of Win98 laptops that used to be able to see the Samba 
shares on my SuSE installation. I've discovered that Ubuntu has a 
slightly different way of sharing. It looks more like sharing on XP than 
the old way. And, from XP, I can see and access the directories I have 
"shared" on my Ubuntu machine. The problem I'm having is getting to 
those directories from my Win98 machines. Win98 sees the Ubuntu machine, 
but when I try to look at the machine, I'm presented with a login 
dialog. On the Ubuntu machine, the only password I've set is for my 
regular user, and that password does not work in the dialog I see from 
Win98. Also, that dialog does not offer the option of specifying a user.

I've done some Googling and found a number of things that don't seem to 
relate. However, there was one that talked about creating a password 
using smbpasswd. What user is samba using when I try to connect from 
Win98? On my SuSE installation samba understood that rsteff was talking 
to rsteff (I have the same user name on all three machines).

Out of luck.  The currently shipping version of the Trendnet
card is 3.1R, which uses the Realtek 8187B chipset.  Yet again.
I've ordered a couple of other adapters that claim to use the
Zydas chipset, and will let you folks know of the results.

Linux Wifi is partly hindered by drivers, mostly hindered by
being unable to determine which currently shipping products
use which chipsets.  If either or both Wifi dongles work, I
will start a list on the PLUG wiki, which may help other people
with their buying decisions.

Yes, I know I can use ndiswrapper, but that is not well supported
by other linux tools, such as Network Manager.  The idea is not
to just make do, it is to purchase the best, and reward vendors
who support us.

Have you tried this driver for it(1)?

There is a Realtek Wifi driver project page(2), but apparently this
particular chipset (8187B) is not yet supported by it, this link I found is
on that page though.  I don't have one of these to test with, but perhaps it
is worth a shot.

I'm guessing you mean the sign in the sig by the user andrewweb. It's
like Rogan says. The image is dynamically generaged, and isn't even
being served by reactos.org. In addition to the User-Agent string,
there's also IP/geolocation involved. (Now I know that the Midland
Branch of the Multnomah Country Library uses NTT America).  The image
is being served from danasoft.com. If you go to their home page it
will show you examples of the various graphics they have including one
that says "Your in Portland" (well, I am, at least). It's just a
gimmick.

Message-ID: <20081005184624.GB14904@gate.kl-ic.com>


I am typing this on an Ubuntu Gutsy 8.04 laptop, connected through a
MyEssentials ME1001-USB ver.1000  USB Wireless G adapter, purchased
yesterday ( 2008 Oct 4 ) at Fry's for $24.99 .  Red box.

My Essentials is part of Belkin, and it is not surprising that 
lsusb reports:     ID 050d:705c Belkin Components

It uses the Zydas chipset and the zd1211rw driver.  The ZD1211 is
apparently the only wireless USB chipset currently available that
works out of the box.  See the recommendations at:
http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Devices/USB

This will provide wifi for my sister until the Realtek RTL8187B
driver ( 0bda:8189 ), which she needs for her builtin mini PCI-E
card, moves beyond early alpha status.  Otherwise, the only way
to use the B version is with ndiswrapper, which doesn't play
nice with Network Manager, the preferred Ubuntu wireless manager.   
ndiswrapper may work better with other AP management systems.  

The Trendnet TEW-424UB and the Belkin FD7050 used to have the
Zydas chipset, and worked, but now they also use the RTL8187B
chip and have the same driver problems. 

If I was willing to use ndiswrapper, I would probably get a 500mW
Alfa from local wireless guy Rick Lindahl's Invictus Networks:

https://shop.invictusnetworks.com/detail.php?id=16104

It is a little larger, but ought to have incredible range, especially
with the big antenna and the long USB cable.

I was unclear.  The older Realtek drivers for the RTL8187 (non B)
did work - rt73 and r8187 IIRC.   The B version breaks these
drivers, and the new version is still under development.  The
improved Realtek driver will be a pretty good option in six months
or so - active development.   Noble souls that enjoy helping out
as beta testers might choose this chipset for that very reason.

I have a new TEW-424UB which I just bought from Newegg with the
RTL8187B.  I will give it to somebody who will actively participate,
coding or beta testing, in the new driver development.

Everyone seems to love Network Manager, but I hate it. I now have
wireless working fine with the internal Intel 4965agn in my T61, but
even so when I click the drop-down box in Network Manager to see
available networks it usually displays nothing. I know the networks are
there because I can find them from the terminal. I don't know what is
wrong with Network Manager, but it has been broken for as long as I've
owned this computer.

I replaced Network Manager with wicd and it is a joy. Works first time,
every time. You have to add a wicd repository for it to show up in
Synaptic, or just download the .deb if you can find it. There are
installation instructions in a thread on the Ubuntu forums.

The only problem with wicd is that it has a hard-coded timeout and it
is too short. And if it can't connect to the network you selected
within the timeout period it moves on to the next network without even
asking you. Thus, I have to watch what I've actually connected to. At
PSU there are multiple networks, but I won't get a DHCP lease if I
connect to one of the faculty or staff networks that I am not
authorized to use. I still love it, though, because it is so simple and
it works. "Works" is the big plus here.

Bear in mind, high transmit power does you no good unless the thing
you are talking to has a similarly high transmit power.  All the extra
tx power does is evaporate more moisture from surrounding trees and
interfere with your neighbors trying to operate on the same (or
nearby) channel.

As I posted on PLUG-TALK, I've been able to get the Belkin "rt73usb"
driver to work with both openSUSE 11 and Gentoo (2.6.25 kernel). I don't
know why it couldn't be made to work with Ubuntu. Have you checked the
Ubuntu forums? Wireless configuration howtos abound there.

Subject: [PLUG] ISP that supports bonding multiple DSL connections?
Message-ID: <48EA4713.7010102@seitzassoc.com>


Does anyone know of an ISP that supports bonding multiple DSL 
connections to achieve higher speeds.  In particular I'd like to get 
higher upload speeds.  This could be through multilink PPP or other 
methods.  I suppose that with a colo, virtual machine, or even a shell 
account one could create multiple PPP tunnels and bond them on the 
remote end.  Another alternative might be multihoming, but my 
understanding of this is that while aggregate speeds would improve, it 
would not improve the speed of an individual connection such as an ssh 
session.  Thoughts?

thanks,
galen

We didn't (before I left at least) offer bonded DSL services, there was an
upgrade to equipment recently that may allow for bonded connections but
previously it wasn't feasible on the gear we were using. They do offer
bonded T1 services though.

Subject: [PLUG] Adding USB IDs to Wireless USB driver
Message-ID: <20081006193501.GA3343@gate.kl-ic.com>


I just got wireless USB working on my SL5 laptop.  There was a lot to
figure out, so I am sharing it here.

I have a MyEssentials ME-1001-USB wireless adapter, which contains a
Zydas zd1211b wireless chipset ( bought from Fry's on saturday October
4 2008.  Note that chipsets change without warning!).  The device is
plug and play on an Ubuntu Heron 8.04 system (with kernel 2.6.24) but
not so with Scientific Linux 5 kernel 2.6.18-8.1.6.el5 . 

The SL5  zd1211rw.ko  driver is missing most of recent the USB device IDs.
So, it needs recompiling with some additions as shown here:

 http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/zd1211rw/AddID

What follows is the recipe that works for Red Hat style RPM systems, and
something similar will probably work for SUSE.    I will let you Ubuntu
Debian Slackware Gentoo folks figure it out on your own.  CentOS documentation
refers to /usr/src/rpmbuild instead of /usr/src/redhat , but the latter is
where the files show up.

I found the source files for my kernel here:

 ftp://fr.rpmfind.net/linux/sourceforge/l/li/linux-ntfs/kernel-2.6.18-8.1.6.el5.src.rpm

Then the standard redhat style kernel preparation, as root:

 rpm -Uvh kernel-2.6.18-8.1.6.el5.src.rpm
 cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/
 rpmbuild -bp --target=i686 kernel-2.6.spec
 cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/kernel-2.6.18
 chmod a+w -R *            # this allows you to work as a normal user

# do these as a normal user

 cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/kernel-2.6.18/linux-2.6.18.i686/drivers/net/wireless/zd1211rw/
 cp -a zd_usb.c zd_usb.c.orig

# option one ----------------------------------------------------------------
# download   http://www.keithl.com/zd_usb.c  
# which contains the current device list as of 2008-Oct-05

# option two ---------------------------------------------------------------
# edit the zd_usb.c file yourself, copying lines from the most recent
# version here:

 http://wireless.kernel.org/download/compat-wireless-2.6/compat-wireless-2.6.tar.bz2

# Untar that into a handy place.  You will be needing the file   zd_usb.c
# to patch the similar file that comes with the kernel.  Otherwise, this
# driver source requires a much more recent kernel.
# 
# copy all the the DEVICE_ZD1211 and DEVICE_ZD1211B lines from the recent
# version   zd_usb.c   and patch them into the kernel source    zd_usb.c

# compile the module, as a normal user --------------------------------------
# using the recipe in   http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/BuildingKernelModules
     
 cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/kernel-2.6.18/linux-2.6.18.i686/
 make clean
 make oldconfig
 make menuconfig     
 make prepare
 make modules_prepare
 make M=drivers/net/wireless/zd1211rw/

 su root
 cp drivers/net/wireless/zd1211rw/*ko /lib/modules/2.6.18-8.1.6.el5/extra/
 /sbin/depmod -a

# all done! ----------------------------------------------------------------

The Wireless USB should now be plug-and-play as eth1.  I did not have
to play with  /etc/sysconfig  or  /etc/modprobe.conf   
Note, this version of the driver, as well as the one running on Ubuntu
8.04 , does not provide signal strength to Network Manager.

The most recent version of this recipe can be found at:

I thought that bonded T1s only improved aggregate bandwidth, while 
still limiting any single connection to 1.5Mb/s. Is my understanding 
flawed?

Bonded T's won't limit you to a single 1.5 connection, you would get a full
3 if they were bonded just like you'd get the full bandwidth of an aggregate
IMA group.

True - if you can't hear them, it doesn't matter how loud you shout,
and you are just a nuisance to others.  I normally use my 100mW
Atheros PCMCIA card anyway.  But I was thinking of those times when
I am a long way from the access point and there is not much else
around. Like Rich Shepard in Pahrump, trying to reach access points
in Las Vegas :-) .

Do any of the drivers control adapter output power?  If the Alfa can
be dialed down to a dull roar for normal use, then the "too loud"
problem is mitigated.

Thanks. I was either misinformed by an ISP or I misunderstood 
(diametrically) what its rep. was telling me.

They were probably trying using a formula of 1.5Mb/s CIR burstable to 3Mb/s

All,

I am trying to run cat 5 cable from my router to two other rooms.  I 
have the wire pulled, spliced together, and am having trouble making 
both cables work.  I have tried resplicing, new wire, and new ends for 
the wall plates.

I realize this isn't Linux related (except I run Linux in my house).  
Email me off list or on...just looking for some pointers.  Google turned 
up lots of books for sale. 

What trick of the trade am I missing here?

Tell us how you're wiring the plugs. What color patter are you using 
with the copper facing you and the plug pointed up? This is how you want 
to do it:

   http://www.peakelec.co.uk/art/8wirepatch.gif

Basically, pins 1 & 2, 3 & 6 are used and the rest not.

Message-ID: <20081009183937.0850febd.johnxj@comcast.net>

Always looking for something simpler and better.

The latest issue of Linux Journal had a mention of Memopal, an online backup service:

http://www.memopal.com/en/default.aspx

Although the software is still in beta, I had no problem installing it on Hardy x86_64. Unfortunately, I have not been able to try it out because the activation routine failed to send me the e-mail it said it was sending for my free 6-day trial account. A query to support has yielded no answers so far.

Nevertheless, it looks really good - $49 per year for 150 GB, and substantial discounts if you pay for more than one year in advance. However, outfits that give big discounts for years in advance have a tendency to disappear quickly. Also not impressed with the buggy web account activation page.

So what do y'all think of $49 per year for 150 GB?

Are there alternative services like this? Which is the best?

I am not sure what you mean by "spliced" but I think what you may have 
to do is two runs - that is one cable for each room (running parallel is 
OK, but I think "splicing" is out).  Is that a problem, or have I missed 
something?

Fred,

I have a plug in one room for a feed point.  I have two other wires all 
connected together.   One feeds a bedroom and one runs to the living 
room.  So, I came from a wall plug (feed point), I then took three cable 
ends and connected three same colored wires (using round smash type 
connectors like the phone company used), then ran the other end of two 
cables to different rooms.

Does that help paint an understandable word picture?

My advice is go buy/beg/borrow/steal a cat5 tester.  They come in
handy, just be careful with them if you are around Power Over Ethernet
equipment.  LEDs don't handle 48V very well.

Bedroom A has the modem and router.  I wired a dual plate for telephone 
and cat 5.  Bedroom B (on the other side of the wall) I wired the same 
with a wire through the wall.  My research showed two wiring 
possibilities for cat 5 (A & B).  B seemed to be compatible with most 
anything I could buy at the store, so I went with that.  The original 
install through the wall A to B worked no problem for several months.

I then added a wire up through the wall, across the attic, and down 
another wall in the living room.  Wired exactly the same.  This is where 
things went downhill.

Bedroom A works as a feed point and the living room outlet work when 
hooked to my laptop.  Each time I have respliced, replaced wire, or 
replaced the plug at the end, bedroom B doesn't work.

I have all eight wires poked down into the plug per the color code on 
the side of the plug.  I bought Leviton plugs and wall plates at Home 
Depot.  The through the wall wire is appx. 2' long.  The living room is 
about 60' of wire away.

Cat 5 needs to be point to point.  You cannot share a drop between
machine and you
cannot have a drop or splice that has a connection point in the middle.

Here is what I did (using Cat6, but same principles): I wanted three
outlets in each bedroom, but realized that I would never use more than
one of them. The reason for three wall plates is because I hate cables
snaking across the floor, so I wanted one plate on each of three walls. 

I wired the cable to the plate that was the most likely to be used and
terminated it in a Leviton plug. For purposes of this discussion, call
this plug A. Then I ran a wire from that wall outlet to the next one
(plug B) and just left the wire inside the boxes for plugs A and B. I
put a connector on the cable in both box A and B and also a snap
connector. I repeated the process for plug C. For future reference I
wrote down what I had done on a piece of paper, in triplicate, folded
them, and put a copy inside each box. 

If I ever plug a computer into B or C and it doesn't work, I know the
first thing I'm going to do is pull the plate off the box and inspect
what's inside the box. That's when I'll see the paper, realize that I
need to open all three boxes and use the snap connectors to make the
wire terminate at the plate I want to use.

Kind of clunky, and the couplers may degrade the signal slightly
(although they are rated Cat6), but it works. And chances are I may
never use plates B and C. I just wanted them there because tearing the
sheetrock down to rewire things is way messy.

Thank you - yes, that is clear and actually what I feared you might mean.
First, I am not an expert on the matter, so of course I may be wrong.
What I have been given to understand by a cabling pro that I have always 
found to be very reliable and sound, is that one cannot splice cat5 cable.
    At the very least it will no longer perform at cat5 levels.
    At the worst it will not perform at all.
In the old cat3 days (telephony), we used to use factory pressed M/F/F 
splitters and F/F connectors to do the sort of thing you described, but 
I have never seen anything similar for cat5.
Sorry - as I said, I could be wrong.

I shan't pretend I clearly understand the topology, but would it be 
possible to introduce a hub into the mix (something small)?  Would that 
help?

In case it helps ... in our house, the cable comes in through the 
vendor's connection (use to be a cable modem, but now it is an RJ45 wall 
jack from Verizon's FiOS), and into a router/firewall/switch.  From 
there we cable separately to each computer and printer that we need.  
The router/firewall/switch takes a public DHCP IP from the vendor (ISP), 
and it serves up private DHCP IPs internally (192.168.1.x).  The 
printers are configured with static IP's in the middle of the private IP 
range, as the router/firewall/switch (depending on make model and 
configuration) will normally serve up IPs from one end or the other of 
the range, an we certainly don't have enough devices to reach the middle 
- thus we avoid IP conflicts.
Regards
Fred James

Others have chimed in, I have this to say:
"cat 5 requires a six inch bend radius"

When trying to get cables to work, a lot of us older folks are used  
to, well, older rules.

Sure, a two inch bend radius works on our car.

Yeah, we could be sloppy as heck with bell wire, splice it, join it  
with electrical tape, whatever.

Back in 10-T days, it didn't matter if we were TIA-568A, or TIA-568B.

...but *now* it matters.

you didn't accidently stick a loop back anywhere did you? Perhaps you should
stick with wireless next time, haha. Anyways I want to clear some stuff up
with a little bit of education, keep everything T586A or T586B there both
the same line just different ties but can make for a big mess if they get
mixed up. And your spice (running in parallel circuit) cause a amperage
issue in the CAT line. if only one is hooked up it will be fine but 2 or
more and you "could" fry a network card or a router. I don't think 100' will
matter as far as impedance you just might run at 10mb/s but who cares? A
spice should ONLY exist in the form of a hub, switch, and maybe a router. 
Extending a wire should use a patch panel. Clamps and soldering "can" be
used to extend a wire but be very careful because it can send you impedance
through the roof and cause packets to be dropped like crazy. I could get
into detail about frequency and different metals but just trust me, buy a
longer wire!! :)  

I think your relating computer cable and phones too close. phone work on 1
line, the computer work on 2 lines one is only incoming and the other is
only outgoing. So it's like having 2 very hyperactive teenage girls talking
to you on the phone but are unaware that the other one is talking to you.
They can only hear what you say, not what the other one is saying... could
you give them an individual IP? I doubt it ^_^ they would get confused and
keep chatting away. A switch would act like a device that divides them on
the line so you can turn one signal off to talk to teen1 and say your
192.168.1.101 and then "SWITCH" to talk to teen2 and say your 192.168.1.102
so when teen1 says MapQuest and teen2 says Google! You can actually tell
them where to go without getting confused.... Yes I did relate a computer to
a hyperactive teenage girl *gasp* they really don't shut up >_<

Computers can talk at 800,000,000 bits/sec so any static even maybe things
you can't hear with your ear can cause a huge problem in a line for a
computer. So naturally computers need to have a higher level of quality than
a phone. 

I hope this helps, and sorry for the long post. Let me know how it goes!

Message-ID: <20081010231030.GA22975@gate.kl-ic.com>


Before I bought the MyEssentials wireless USB adapter, I mail
ordered a couple of brandX ZyDAS adapters, to try out some
other kinds.  One is still on the way from Hong Kong.  The
other arrived today, and works OK.

http://insidecomputer.stores.yahoo.net/8054wiusb20d.html
USB ID: 0ace:1215 ZyDAS
$18.98 including shipping

Unlike the MyEssentials I wrote about a week ago (ID 050d:705c),
this uses one of the older ZyDAS USB IDs and is supported by the
USB ID tables in older (2.6.18) drivers.   However, for my distro
at least (Scientific Linux, a RHEL5 clone), it still needs the
firmware in /lib/firmware/zd1211 , which can be downloaded from:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=129083

We will see what the $9.98 Hong Kong USB adapter will do. 
It may take a while to get here.

These will be useful at the Linux Clinic on the 19th.

Message-ID: <48EFFCE0.4050407@verizon.net>

All,

Thank each of you for the education you have given me.  Between the 
ASCII art and the explanations, I have learned enough to make it work.

I stopped by Home Depot on the way home from work, purchased another cat 
5e "jack" (instead of plug that I was referencing it as) and a triple 
wall plate.

I now have separate runs to each place, fed from the router.  What I 
don't understand is why one termination point did not work when they 
were all spliced together.  It doesn't matter anymore, just curious.

Thanks again,

Bruce

Meh. He's not wiring a datacenter. And I've never heard of 6 inches. The 
idea is you don't want to kink it, or you could risk optimum performance 
or possibly severing a wire.

Ok, so this isn't like electricity where you can just tie all the colors 
together. Each wire needs to go from a computer, back to the 
switch/hub/router-with-switch/somethinglikethat. Like this:

http://www.guardianhometechnologies.com/img/home-network/home-network-diagram.gif

That diagram doesn't show any walls, but you should get the idea. Wall 
plates are fine, but not in a way that causes two different computers 
(or any network device) to share a cable. You want a wall plate that has 
enough ports for each room you're going to have a cable run to. Like this:

http://www.summitsource.com/images/products/ACA204.jpg

Actually, you can use a shared cable by using the unused pairs but 
that's very VERY hackish and only to be done in extreme circumstance 
where the boss didn't have the foresight to know he was going to put 
that printer there and was too cheap to by a freaking switch. But I 
digress...

When I first read that 6 inch bend radius I questioned it. Like, how do
you do a 6 inch bend radius inside a wall that has a 3.5 inch cavity?
Then again, if you can run Linux and can do network wiring, you can
probably bend space.

I may be stretching my memory, but didn't you say you had cut a length 
of wire for each leg of the run?
 From that I assume you "punched" the wires down at each terminus and 
juncture, in such a way that at some juncture(s) there might have been 
two (or more) sets of wire punched down on top of each other?
Or was the connection/extension done with with those crimp devices?
Yes, that's probably what you did say, now that I think of it.
No matter - either way is quite iffy.  Iffy enough that it doesn't 
always work in telco, and really iffy in cat5
So that junction (splice?) is the probable cause.
One would need a Cat5 testing set to actually see the problem - they 
usually have some sort of readout or display that tells that sort of 
thing.  Some of them will print you a nice report.

Hi Bruce,

I'm glad it's working, and I'm glad I could help.

This website does a pretty good job of explaining how it works.

another "just works, without ndiswrapper" adapter that i just picked
up cheaply from newegg is this fellow:

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833130111

not the sveltest kid in the bunch, but in my incredibly-wifi-crowded
area (11 networks found by iwlist scanning, 15 found by the windows
utility it ships with), i wasn't going to get reasonable reception
with something that looked like a usb thumb drive with no antenna
anyway.

ubuntu 8.04 found it without issue and it works fine in XP as well.

Message-ID: <20081011233325.GC27156@gate.kl-ic.com>


Semi-off topic, but ...

I usually bring the projector for Advanced Topics, and hope to do
so this Wednesday.  However, my mother-in-law is gravely ill back
in Maryland, and I may be heading east without much warning.  If so,
we will need to make alternate arrangements.  Two possibilities:

1) Somebody else can bring a projector.  That would be easiest.

2) Somebody near Beaverton can transport my projector to and from
the meeting.

2a) I can drop the projector (and the bag with the extension cords)
off at said somebody's house on the way to the airport, if I have
enough warning and can figure out where the house is, and said
somebody doesn't mind an unscheduled early-morning door knocking.

2b) My neighbor has the key, and I can have him get the projector 
and bag and he can hold it for pickup.

Again, there may be little warning - this morning, my wife headed
back east with 3 hours between a phone call and a quickly arranged
flight departure.  I may have less warning than that.  I would
appreciate somebody backing me up on this.  Alan has enough trouble
getting speakers to show up without worrying about this, too.

Thanks;

Keith

I can pick up the projector from you today and bring it to the meeting on
wednesday.

I live in Tigard, so a drop-off on the way to the airport from beavertown
would be unpractical. If you would prefer I don't hold on to it in between
now and then, I will volunteer to come pick it up from your neighbor the day
of the meeting.

That is a useful looking device!
The Zonet ZEW2500P is a small external USB-cabled unit.
Newegg is out of stock, ewiz.com claims to have them for $22.79 
before shipping.  However, when I google for Zonet, I get a "This
site may harm your computer" warning, so I'm not going there. 
According to the Provantage spec page, it transmits at 17dBm
(50mW) in B mode and 13dBm (20mw) in G mode - good for a nearby
access point, less good for a distant one.

I would still like to learn more, though.  Could you please:

1) Tell us what the FCC ID is (should be on a label on the bottom)?

2) Tell us what /sbin/lsusb says the ID is?
   I'm guessing:   148f:2573 Ralink Technology, Corp

3) Extra credit: with /sbin/lsmod, can you figure out which driver
   it uses?  I'm guessing Ralink RT73 .

Thanks!

Keith

fortunately, my access point is 25 feet away.  however, it sees so
many networks with reasonable (>25%) signal strength, none of which
can be closer than 50 feet (and through at least 2
100-year-old-walls), many of which have to be further away just to
judge from the layout of nearby housing.

That is indeed the RT73 driver, usb version.  These drivers are often
built up out of many modules.  You described it just right, and this
will help others who buy the device.

>> 1) Tell us what the FCC ID is (should be on a label on the bottom)?
>
> FCC ID PQP-WU233G

That is useful to others to tell if they got the same product as you -
sometimes the manufacturer will change the guts and the chipset
without changing the product model number.   When the manufacturer
does that, they are required to change the FCC ID, which is why
that is valuable to the rest of the community.  Thank you!


However, if you are an obsessive nerd like me, you can learn all
sorts of additional stuff about your device.  Go to:

https://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/GenericSearch.cfm

You can enter "PQP" for the Grantee code, and "-WU233G" as the
product code, and then click Detail to get to this page:

https://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=N&application_id=395176&fcc_id='PQP-WU233G'

You will need to install the Traditional Chinese Fonts to view
some of the PDFs,  available for free download from:

http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/acrrasianfontpack.html

Then you can look at the manuals schematics, pictures of the guts,
etc.  Sometimes the internal pictures are the only way to tell
which exact chip is used - in this case, an RT2572T MAC chip and
an RT2526L transceiver chip.  The 93C66 is a 4Kbit serial memory
that stores the MAC address, calibration information, and the
legal wifi channels for the US.  Hack that, and you can jack up
your power, have your very own wireless band, interfere with all
all sorts of other communication, and get the FCC on your ass :-/ .

This is my first post,
Remember a 500mw is illegal if you're running it in Oregon. 
100mw is the legal limit and if found my neighbor saw you with a 500mw
transmitter you would have investigation going on, she doesn't even hold
cell phones to her head. The antenna doesn't look like it can support a
clean 500mw TX anyways. I would go with a directional antenna at a lower TX
rate and/or a good repeater. DD-wrt can help boot your range a ton.  I set
have set-up government wifi solutions for a while with RADIUS servers and
splash pages. Don't fry our children :)

you didn't accidently stick a loop back anywhere did you? Perhaps you should
stick with wireless next time, haha. Anyways I want to clear some stuff up
with a little bit of education,
keep everything T586A or T586B there both the same line just different ties
but can make for a big mess if they get mixed up. And your spice (running in
parallel circuit) cause a amperage issue in the CAT line. if only one is
hooked up it will be fine but 2 or more and you "could" fry a network card
or a router. I don't think 100' will matter as far as impedance you just
might run at 10mb/s but who cares? A spice should ONLY exist in the form of
a hub, switch, and maybe a router. 
Extending a wire should use a patch panel. Clamps and soldering "can" be
used to extend a wire but be very careful because it can send you impedance
through the roof and cause packets to be dropped like crazy. I could get
into detail about frequency and different metals but just trust me, buy a
longer wire!! :)  

I think your relating computer cable and phones too close. phone work on 1
line, the computer work on 2 lines one is only incoming and the other is
only outgoing. So it's like having 2 very hyperactive teenage girls talking
to you on the phone but are unaware that the other one is talking to you.
They can only hear what you say, not what the other one is saying... could
you give them an individual IP? I doubt it ^_^ they would get confused and
keep chatting away. A switch would act like a device that divides them on
the line so you can turn one signal off to talk to teen1 and say your
192.168.1.101 and then "SWITCH" to talk to teen2 and say your 192.168.1.102
so when teen1 says MapQuest and teen2 says Google! You can actually tell
them where to go without getting confused.... Yes I did relate a computer to
a hyperactive teenage girl *gasp* they really don't shut up >_<

Computers can talk at 800,000,000 bits/sec so any static even maybe things
you can't hear with your ear can cause a huge problem in a line for a
computer. So naturally computers need to have a higher level of quality than
a phone. 

I hope this helps, and sorry for the long post. Let me know how it goes!

A followup.

It turns out that the web page should not have told me it was sending me an e-mail because it does so only if you pay for the service. I had the free 6-day trial version. All I had to do was use a command from the terminal using the username and password that I signed up with.

Once you issue the command it starts the service and it just runs as long as the computer is running. Unfortunately, it does not add an entry to the startup scripts, so if you reboot you must reenter the command manually. There has been discussion of this on Memopal's forums, so presumably this will be fixed. Bear in mind that the Linux version of the software is still officially in beta. It appears that eventually there will also be a GUI version of the software.

More problematic is that there is a bug that causes the backup to stop after a while. Again, this is discussed at length on the Memopal forums for Linux, but no one knows why and the Memopal staff do not post anything on the forums. 

As long as it is running it is pretty cool. I notice no slowdown in my upload and download speeds while using the computer. Their software must be doing something rsync-y, except that it saves older versions of files on their server. And $49 for 150 GB for one year (25% discount for each subsequent year) is a pretty good price for the service. I just wish they would say something about when they expect to have the bugs fixed. Because of the sudden stopping I cannot get it to upload more than about 3.2 GB.

I think you are wrong.  The limits are established by the FCC.  You
can transmit with 1W with a 6dBi antenna, or combinations of lower
wattage and higher antenna gain.  For point-to-point, you can exceed
that.  Google EIRP.

E.g.:

  <http://www.michwave.com/bbnetwork/faq/fcc.htm>

For example, the SkyPilot access point devices that MetroFi used,
employed 400 mW radios (26 dBm) and 7.5 dBi antennas.  When you add
those gains together, you get 33.5 dBm, so they are at least a few dB
under the limit.  The antenna gain of most USB or pccard type wifi is
more apt to be around 2 dBi, so more tx power (up to a watt) is legal.

Oregon, as far as I know, has no authority to regulate transmit power
in the ISM bands, and has not attempted to do so.  If I am wrong,
please point me to the rule or legislation.

I assume you are joking - perhaps if I understood your syntax I 
would understand your point.

1)  The FCC regulates radios, not the states.  If the states tried,
they would probably be sued by the manufacturers, claiming interference
with interstate commerce.  If Oregon does have such a law, please
provide the Oregon Revised Statute number (they are online);  a few
minutes of looking around produced nothing like a limit.

2)  Cell phones can go up to a watt, especially if they are a long
way from, or shielded from, the base station.   And most people
hold that one watt transmitter right next to their head without
melting their ears off.  A 500mW wireless transmitter is usually
much farther away, and the inverse square law applies.

3)  Antennas do not limit power, at least not until they melt from
resistive losses or dielectric absorption.  Sometimes antennas
couple poorly, have a high standing wave ratio, etc., but with
a proper matching network they not reflect power back to the
transmitter and cause distortion.  Wireless devices are sample
tested for spurious emissions, and you can see the results for
particular devices at the FCC website I pointed at in the last
post.  For the "500mW" Alfa (actually 290mW B and and 90mW G )
with FCCID UQ2 AWUS036H :

https://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/prod/oet/forms/blobs/retrieve.cgi?attachment_id=786770&native_or_pdf=pdf

The Alfa is well within the FCC limits on all specs.  The dipole
antenna on the device has a numeric gain of 1.58, and that short
antenna an efficient emitter at 2.4GHz.  

4)  Again, the main issue with excessive power wifi (as Russell noted
so well) is that your packets are competing with other packets for
the attention of all the other access points you *aren't* talking
to.  Rude and unneighborly.  The additional power won't help you if
the access point you are listening to is wimpy and you can't hear it. 
If there is only one access point around, and it has decent power,
higher power might improve your connection. 

I would only use the Alfa rather than my 100mW Netgear WG511T
if I had trouble reaching the access point.  If nothing else, the
Alfa probably drains my laptop battery faster than the WG511T.

5)  If 500mW transmitters can fry your children, your species is
very small ...

Subject: [PLUG] SCSI Scanner on Ubuntu 8.04
Message-ID: <48F38252.5030200@comcast.net>

What do I need to read to learn how to get my Epson Perfection 600 
scanner working on 8.04? This machine used to run SuSE 10.1. I had this 
scsi scanner working on that distro.

I powered up the scanner. When I ran xsane I got the error message 
telling me that it couldn't find a scanner. (I expected this.) Using 
Synaptic, I installed scsitools. I ran rescan-scsi-bus.sh and then ran 
xsane again. Now it finds the scanner, but when I try to "Acquire 
preview" I get the error message: Failed to start scanner: Invalid argument.

I've tried running xsane with strace, but I get a 47,000+ line output 
file, and don't really know what I'm looking for; the above error 
message is not found in the strace output file.

Recommendations on what to do next are appreciated.

...

I vaguely remember an error like that, years ago, with my Epson.  It
was a device permissions problem, IIRC.  The Epson finally failed 
(greenish tinge on scans), and I am using a USB scanner now, so I
don't have recent information, sorry.

The Clinic is next Sunday.  If this is not resolved by then, come
on down!

This ought to be a piece of cake, but I can't get it to work.

First I tried various things in the ls command, but the man page didn't help much and I failed.

Google turned up some suggestions, including du. After reading man du and further googling I got this far:

I'm not sure why it shows files of 1 MB as the largest files in ~/. There are several files over 100 MB in there.

Are there any du experts in here?

hmm, i wouldn't use du to do it, but i think the root of your problem
is that you're using the "-h" flag which flubs the sorting-by-number
system up, since 1008K > 100M when you start letting computers sort

i'd probably do find . -type f -size +50M -exec ls -l {} \; |sort -r

Message-ID: <20081013145552.d010faa6.johnxj@comcast.net>

Having just succeeded in getting a list of the ten biggest files in my home folder (thanks Chris) I discovered that I have the following:

-rw------- 1 jjj jjj 423321216 2008-03-24 14:12 /home/jjj/Desktop/ADBEFLPRCS3_WWE.exe

Nautilus says it is 403.7 MB. Google turned up several sites, one of which says it is an Adobe Extractor (whatever an extractor is). But the only software from Adobe that is on this computer (other than the stuff installed in Virtualbox-Win2000) is Adobe Reader 8.1 and Flash. I doubt that the program file for either is 407 MB. 

Another site said this file is a virus:

http://www.baidumsg.com/Howtoremove/Howtoremove_54572.html

Regardless, how did an .exe file end up on my Hardy x86_64 computer? And does anyone have any idea what it is?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0810131623450.19901@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This morning I received a call from Verizon Wireless's Fraud Department.
The encryption chip(?) in my Treo 700p is apparently weak or failing and
someone was able to grab the radio signal and enough information that they
could clone the phone. It was used from New York City to call the Dominican
Republic Friday and Saturday. The most likely location for intercepting the
radio signal was at Chicago's O'Hare Airport Thursday evening while I changed
planes.

   Palm has a firmware upgrade to the 700p that fixes the problem, along with
some other issues. However, the upgrade can be applied _only_ via computers
running WinXP, W2K, or Mac OS X with Palm's desktop software installed. They
have _no_ linux support whatsoever. This bothers me as I've used Palm OS
PDAs and Smartphones since 1995 or so, and with linux (jpilot) since 1997.
So, no fix from Palm.

   Verizon Wireless's fraud busters were able to talk me through changing the
encryption codes so they could turn outgoing call capability from my phone
number back on. However, this does not upgrade the firmware, only let's them
block all calls made from a phone claiming to be mine, but with the old
code.

   I don't need a replacement right away since the Treo 700p is only about a
year old. But, I would like to learn what linux-supporting smartphones (pda
and telephone is all I need; no music, pictures, TV, or anything else
needed). I've nothing against Verizon Wireless (they were very helpful today
as they have been ever since I bought cellular service with AirTouch), but
they do charge $60 per month for 'Net access (Web only, I believe) which I
wouldn't use enough to justify the cost.

   Please suggest such a cell phone and share your experiences with it.
Compatibility with pilot-link and jpilot is almost a necessity.

TIA,

Rich

i've been using a pilot since '98 (about 6 palm III/IIIx's over the
course of 8 years and a treo 700p now) and unfortunately they've
always suffered this problem--the rom update utility was always a
windows or mac utility.  the one time every two years (more in the
middle, when i was going through used palm III's at the rate of one
per 8 months) that i had to upgrade the ROM, i always needed a mac or
win machine to do so. as in 1998, so in 2008.  there was never a
*need*, strictly speaking (as you see, your phone still works..) but i
do like the later revs of palmOS esp on the old kit.  as you say,
everything else for the pilot is better under linux--i have fixed more
than one horked device by doing something like dumping and restoring
all the memos or contacts after some minor edits, for instance.  i
love being able to back everything up with a single command, and
restore to another device with absolutely no hassle.  the two or three
times i really tried to use palm's windows or mac software to do
synchronization, it was so un-unix-like that i felt like an imbecile
and screwed things up thoroughly.  pilot-link Just Works, and is
intuitive.

just for the record, sprint's all-you-can-eat internet is $20 a month.
 i realize this is largely a moot point since you'd have to abandon
your contract and buy a new phone, but i use google maps/mail and ssh
frequently, and even use my phone as a modem sometimes for that cost.

I think you'll have a hard time finding a non-palm-device that
pilot-link works with, unfortunately :(

luck++;

   Well, as long as I can continue to use jpilot (I've know Judd since he
first released it, and have sent him money from time to time because I
depend so heavily on his great tool), I don't care about the middleware.

   You're probably correct, however, that I'll need to wait until I feel
motivated to upgrade the phone before I get a firmware upgrade. I know no
one who has a Winduhs installation (or a Mac) that uses a Palm and has their
desktop software installed.

   Ah, well.

Thanks, Chris,

Rich

Message-ID: <c834ec80810131835t3e94b0fcx30cc68e23fa95e6f@mail.gmail.com>

Has anyone here used the Open Moko Freerunner?  I'm in the market for
a new phone, and I'm trying to decide between the Freerunner and the
T-Mobile G1 (the android phone) -- "Openness" is pretty important to
me, but so is stability and practicality.

Anyhow, Rich's question about smart phones hit pretty close to home,
;) although my requirements are much less pda-centric.  I've made due
so far with nothing more complex than a razr, with very little
browsing so jumping to something like the freerunner / G1 will be a
pretty big change.  (and no, I will not consider an iphone.  I've been
burned by Apple's DRM enough, thanks.)

I guess my question boils down to this:

Are the Free phones mentioned above ready for general use, and/or are
there others that I should consider?

Thanks!
Rogan

I haven't used the Open Moko directly, but heard from Don Park (past
president of PTP) that it had some issues as of a couple months ago.
I haven't heard anything recently.  It might be better now, or he may
have exaggerated.  Fwiw.

That is *ancient*.  A modern one with File::Find would look like:

    my $N = 10; # ok, so it's not a command line arg :)

    use File::Find;

    my %size;
    find(sub {
      $size{$File::Find::name} = -s _ if not -l and -f _;

Untested, but I often get this right.

I've been keeping a watch on the Google Android, rolling out with
Tmobile sometime in the next few months.  That will be open-source
everything.   http://code.google.com/android/

I am even less of a power user than you, but I expect the open source
community will come up with some interesting oddball applications for
Android.   Personally, I'm interested in intercepting the sound signal
path, and doing some digital signal processing on it.  I am hard of
hearing, and perhaps I can improve sound quality, or adapt the sound
level to ambient noise, or otherwise make mobile phones a little more
usable for me.  If I am local, I might even route the sound to my
home server and do some speech recognition on it, sending back the
text in near-real-time if possible.

I also expect to be able to hack hardware into it;  for example, a
belt-loop recharging cradle, or a better headset, or ...

My wife is a doctor and PDA user.  I can imagine quite a few more 
apps being useful to her, and this device becoming her interface for
everything - pager (via internet), dictation + text, patient chart
notes, web searches, etc.  Being a unix-like machine, I hope we can
set it up super-securely, back it up with rsync, etc.  

All that will depend on an active development community, of course. 
My wife and I will probably limp along on our brick phones until we
see how the early adopters fare.  When some of my friends start buying
these I will be very interested in helping with the learning process.

You should also be aware of OpenMoko, if you aren't already:

http://openmoko.com/product.html

I'd like to know what you see as the big differences between OpenMoko
and Android (granted, OpenMoko will probably be able to run Android :)

the n in the for loop needs to be uppercased - then it work.

Jax Bar
826 SW 2nd Ave
Portland, OR 97204
(503) 228-9128

Speaker:   Robert Love
           Intel

Subject: Open FibreChannel over Ethernet

Robert Love is a Sr. Software Engineer at Intel Corporation. He
graduated from The University of Maryland, College Park with a B.S. in
Computer Science and has worked at Intel for the last 7 years. Most of
that time was spent writing server management software, but lately his
focus has shifted to networked storage solutions. Robert was involved in
the enabling of iSCSI boot technology for Linux but is now focused on
Fibre Channel over Ethernet. In November of 2007, Robert published a GPL
FCoE solution with the intent of merging it into the Linux kernel. He,
and his team, continue to evolve that initial work in the pursuit of
Linux kernel inclusion.

My phone contract is up in November.  I am looking at getting the G1 as
soon as I can after the expire date.  (If I can con my wife into it.)  I
will give a report on it as soon as I can obtain one.

Subject: [PLUG] Taiwan wireless USB device arrives, works fine
Message-ID: <20081014233427.GA7908@gate.kl-ic.com>


I am connected through wireless USB adapter I bought from "yyhpeter"
through Ebay, item number 350104540187 , a buy-it-now auction running
through the end of October.   $9.99, free shipping.  The manufacturer
is Safe Home, www.safehome.com.tw

Suggested, for those that want inexpensive and Linux compatable
wireless adapters.  Shipping from Taiwan is about two weeks.  It is
only a 20mW transmitter, so it does not have much range, but it should
work with nearby access points.  

/sbin/lsusb:  0ace:1215 ZyDAS

... which according to the driver source, is a ZyDAS ZD1211B .  This
is an older USB ID, and will be in the built in drivers back to the
2.6.18 kernels (some newer IDs, with the same chipset, are only included
in newer versions of the driver).  For some distros, you must download
the firmware to go into the /lib/firmware/zd1211 directory, which you
can get from here:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=129083&package_id=187875

The FCC ID is PAN WL2203V .  Reports available here:

https://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=N&application_id=217044&fcc_id='PANWL2203V'

If you want a bit more range,  the MyEssentials wireless USB adapter
($25 at Fry's) also uses the ZD1211B but has a 50mW transmitter.
With a more recent USB ID, it may require a driver upgrade.

I will be bringing both to the Clinic on Sunday.  If people like
the Safe Home device, perhaps you can get together to make a group
buy and get some even cheaper.  Then, perhaps we can stop dealing
with adapters that don't work with Linux.

So, I've been looking into this more, and I was initially leaning
towards the OpenMoko Freerunner, since it seems to offer the best of
both worlds: Open software and Open hardware (android is just a
software spec that works on a number of phones, from what I
understand).  I was also under the impression that, since Android is
Open Source (Apache licensed, even) that Open Moko hardware would be
able to run Android.

Alas, Android is *not* "all open".  The layer that actually talks to
the hardware is proprietary, and as far as I have been able to tell,
there are no plans to open source that portion.  Even given that, it
would *probably* work on OpenMoko, but the builds were created for a
different version of the ARM instruction set.

Blog posts about this: (the first links to the second)

http://jyro.blogspot.com/2008/01/openmoko-android-and-great-hacking-post.html
http://benno.id.au/blog/2007/11/21/android-neo1973

talking to devs in the openmoko irc channel seems to confirm that this
is still relevant.

This "semi-open" structure, combined with the restriction of carries
on the G1 is probably going to be enough to offset the higher cost of
the Freerunner, IMO.

(Besides, the Freerunner currently has three different software stacks
you can run, and at least one of them is based on Enlightenment Dr17!)

I'm a t.mobile customer and preordered a G1 on the first day so I hope
to have one by the end of next week.  I've got too many projects going
right now so I don't expect to do programming for a while.

You could install your software on a friends machine, do the firmware 
upgrade and then uninstall it. Or call a local Verizon store and see if 
they will do the update for you.

I have both a windows laptop, desktop, and an old G4 imac and could
install the desktop software so you could update it.

>From looking at your phone numbers it even looks like I'm in your
area. I live between Gresham and Sandy. I'm pretty busy with school
and family, but should be able to make some time. I go to school at
MHCC weekday mornings. I haven't messed around with a palm pilot much
since I busted my old smartphone years ago. I have an old IIIx but it
doesn't see much use.

Is the desktop software still freely downloadable? I could install it
and the firmware if you wanted to just find some time to get together
and run the update. Should only take a few minutes, right? Maybe 10-15
tops? Shouldn't be too hard to squeeze that in.

Let me know.
Erik

(I've had too many issues with recording video in Linux, and right now
as a VERY busy student I don't have time to play much with Linux, so
at the moment I don't think it's installed on anything. I still like
to keep on top of news about it, so I'm still on the list in spite of
not being so true to it...) :)

You may be more adept at googling than me. For me the second link in
google for me tells me it is the installer for the entire creative
suite 3 - that is, Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign. The fith link
tells me it is a virus. Then again, that may be the same thing. And as
far as I know there is no trial version of flash, as it is free. And
flash could not possibly be 407 MB.

I have moved it to a CD which I will probably eventually throw away.
Having done so everything continues to run OK, including flash in
Firefox and Opera. The big question is how it got on my Ubuntu
computer. The only Adobe products on this computer are Reader 8.1 and
Flash. And both were installed with Synaptic from the non-free
repositories.

Uhm, he isn't talking about the free downloadable Flash _player_.
He is talking about the decidedly non-free Flash _creator_.
As in the development environment where one creates Flash content for others
to consume.

OK. 

Well, I am not a programmer and have no use for the flash creator. I
don't do web sites and I have no knowlele of how or to desire to do so.
So I'll must delete the file and forget about it. :)

For all the good folks that volunteered to help - thanks!  My m.i.l.
is doing OK for now, and I will be at the A.T. meeting.  

I have a a minor request - I would like to teach a few people there
how to operate the projector, focus and frame it, and safely shut
it down, in case I have to make similar arrangements in the future.

The main thing to remember is that the bulb inside gets EXTREMELY
HOT, and the projector needs to keep running the fan and cooling the
bulb after the light shuts off, or else the insides get toasted.

   When I have time I'll buy a SD card and try the Mac route. I have no Palm
desktop software to be installed on someone's machine, and that's apparently
necessary. The Verizon stores cannot do the Palm upgrade, only Verizon
stuff.

   Actually, now that I have a changed code I don't care about the upgrade,
unless my phone is still vulnerable to code capture when I use it in risky
environments such as major airports. I notice no lost functionality on the
phone, but the issues may all be internal.

Thanks for the thought,

Rich

You don't need the software and Win/OSX isn't required. You just need 
the SD card and a way to get data on it. It sounds like this is what you 
need to do:

http://www.palm.com/us/support/downloads/treo700pupdate/verizon_installsd.html

Get the file and use your Linux software to put the file on the Fat32 
formatted SD card while in the phone and connected to your PC. You can 
get a 1GB card for ~$10 or less or borrow one from a camera you have 
possibly, or a friend.

Subject: [PLUG] Actions after a USB device is plugged in
Message-ID: <48F606C9.40901@acm.org>

A HAM radio operator has a packet control device(?) whose Windows 
software runs under Wine.  His runs Ubuntu.

When he plugs a the USB-to-serial device the systems mounts(?) it as 
/dev/ttyUSB0.  The problem comes because the Windows software will only 
see /dev/ttyS[0-3] (aka. COM1 - COM4).

We were able to soft link and get the software to see and use it but it 
appears Ubuntu cleans out the /dev directory entries either during 
shutdown, startup, or when the USB-to-serial device is removed.  The 
link didn't last between reboots.  So for now he opens a terminal, sudo 
to root, and creates the link each time he boots.

Is there a way to automagically run a script or command (ln -sf 
/dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/ttyS3) after the USB-to-serial device is plugged in?

I don't run Ubuntu and can't install it as my bench/test machine is 
being used by my wife while I fix her system. 8-(

Any help is appreciated.


Thanks,
Rod

   That's what I planned on doing.

   I assume that's a ScanDisk memory card, yes? I think that I have one for
my old Olympus D-340L camera.

Rod,

   It ain't unique to Ubuntu. It took me a while to grok the differences when
I switched from my Kyocera smartphone and its serial charging/data
connection to the Treo with its USB data connection.

   The USB connection is created when the device is attached and the button
on the cable is pressed, and destroyed when the device is removed.
Unfortunately, softlinks fail because they point to a specific /dev/ttUSB.
Here's a session from /var/log/messages:

Oct 15 08:47:42 salmo kernel: usb 1-1: new full speed USB device using

   Why it always generates two devices I don't know. Perhaps each one is
monodirectional.

   The answer to this is above my pay grade; I don't know. I do specify
/dev/tts/USB1 in the jpilot port setting and it seems to Just Work.

Most modern Linux distributions use a daemon called udev or something
similar to automatically generate /dev devices at boot time and for
hotplugging events (like USB devices being added/removed).  Your best
bet will probably be to look into udev's configuration under /etc/udev
and create a rule to set up that symlink when the specific device is
detected in the system.

There is nothing preventing you from creating a symlink when the target
does not exist.  It will be a broken link until the target becomes
available.  Why not just write an init.d script that creates the link?

Well, because the specific device being set up is not guaranteed to be
mapped to /dev/ttyUSB0.  Maybe that's the only tty USB device that
system will ever see, but udev is desiged to create these mappings more
correctly, from what I understand.

   Don't know if this is distribution-specific, but it's annoying and I'd
like to fix the problem if I can.

   I remap the left control and cap lock keys using ~/.keymap. In
~/.bash_profile is the line

loadkeys ~/.keymap

   This works just fine on the server/workstation, but not on the notebook.
I've no idea how to diagnose why it won't work on the notebook in console
mode. Suggestions needed.

   FWIW, the remapping under X works on both systems.

Tim,

Thanks.  My concern was with how Ubuntu does this stuff verses CentOS 
(my distribution of choice.) You know, if it was a sort-of, SystemV 
verses Berkeley thing.  I can now work on it now knowing it is udev.

Rich, Carlos.

Thanks for the ideas.

A quick google for udev shows that udev rules can easily create
symlinks.  I would scrap my approach in favor of a 100% udev approach.

I found the same when I first started looking around.  After a short 
side trip down "Old Hotplug Lane" I realized I needed to know if Ubuntu 
used udev.

Watch out now.  I'm going to be dangerous.

I suggest that perhaps .bash_profile is not executing when you login at 
the console.

Does it load the keymap if you run loadkeys manually?

Eric,

   It's not .bash_profile, but a permissions problem. If I log on a different
console as root the keys are remapped. Logged in as me I'm told I don't have
permissions for the keymaps 0, 1, and 2.

   These appear to be in /usr/share/kbd/, and all directories are world
executable (755) while owned by root.root. The individual i386/querty/*
files are world readable (644) so I don't know where the permission error
originates. The perms from / down match on the workstation/server and the
notebook.

   You've shown me where the problem originates, and I appreciate that. Can
you now suggest how I can determine where the permissions problem is?

Thanks very much,

Rich

If you're really curious, you could just run `strings' against it. That
won't tell you how it got onto your computer, but it may clear up the
mystery of WTF-izzit.

I'd use strace on a manual loadkeys run.  It'll show you exactly which
call is creating the error, and if it's in reference to a file (tty
ownership?) you can perhaps correct it via udev (if udev is in use) or
just chmod/chowning the device files permanently otherwise.

If it's a syscall not referring to a file for which you don't have
permission, post the call and the error here and we'll figure out how
to change the situation.

You could try strace. Just put strace in front of the full command you use
to try to change key maps, and look at the last few lines of output.

You may have to install the strace utility if your distro doesn't come with
it by default.

   It appears to be KDSKBENT. A Google search turns up 2,640 hits from
different distributions, mostly Red Hat-ish. That string is followed by "-1
EPERM (Operation not permitted)".

   That help any?

On the ol' gentoo laptop, this is what I find when grepping the kernel
sources:

root at sphinktop:/usr/src/linux# find -type f -print0 |xargs -0 -e grep -n -i 'KDSKBENT'
./fs/compat_ioctl.c:2011:COMPATIBLE_IOCTL(KDSKBENT)
./drivers/char/vt_ioctl.c:96:   case KDSKBENT:
./drivers/char/vt_ioctl.c:576:  case KDSKBENT:
./drivers/s390/char/keyboard.c:362:     case KDSKBENT:

./include/linux/kd.h:109:#define KDSKBENT       0x4B47  /* sets one entry in translation table */

keyboard.c seems a likely place to start looking.  There are these two
functions in there.  Notice that the first one calls the second one, and
the second one returns -EPERM.  The key line seems to be this:

     perm = current->signal->tty == kbd->tty || capable(CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG);

If this is false, you get your error.

What does this all mean?  No idea.

Carlos,

   That's a good clue. I have two versions of the distribution, the notebook
is newer. This evening I'll upgrade it to the latest and see if the issue
still exists with the newer kernel. Then I'll plan to upgrade the
server/workstation by two releases to bring it current, too.

Thanks,

Rich

also check to see if apparmor or SELinux is enabled--i think they are
likely to be the only users of Capabilities (the system-level
permissions system) in your OS, and at least some of the hits i saw
via google were about SELinux (and i think Apparmor is similar enough
to be a suspect in this case).

   I've not seen anything indicating that Slackware uses either of these.

Subject: [PLUG] Looking for good C graphing software
Message-ID: <1224108968.11841.10.camel@rotwang>

I am looking for code to take a pile of c code and graph the function
calls so I can see what calls what.

I have a video driver that I am trying to make some fixes to.  It was
originally cribbed from another chipset driver.  They ripped out the
insides and replaced it with something else.  (Kind of like finding a
hollowed out pumpkin, opening it up and finding a duck.)

Anyone know of a good utility for graphing out function calls in C?  I
can't think of any at the moment and this code is as clear as some sort
of post-bovine grass process.

Thanks.

Much of the time malware authors will ofuscate the binary with some sort
of compression utility.  The file command will reveal may of these
executable compressors.

I recently encountered a malware program designed as a rar archive
password program.  If you ran it, it installed a nasty little trojan on
your system.  (It was included with passworded rar archives of video
files.)  The script kiddie who wrote it did not use any sort of
offuscation.  The password and the name of the malware were in the
binary in clear text.  Running strings would show where he replaced the
defaults.  (It had a "password = foo" and "install = trojan.exe" line in
it.)  Pretty damn pathetic.

Y'all have me at a disadvantage. I do not know what "running strings" means.

'strings' is a program that searches it's argument(s) for printable
characters.  Almost every file has some ASCII-encoded content that's
still ascii-encoded, such as copyright notices, window titles, version
numbers, etc.  Often the entire content of the Help->About window will
be tucked away in a binary this way.  strings will pull that out so
you can see it.  eg:

$ strings ADBEFLPRCS3_WWE.exe

'SanDisk' is one of many brands. 'SD' is the type of flash memory card 
that fits in your phone. Many cameras also use that type of memory. Pay 
attention to the top part in that link. You cannot use the newer type of 
SDHC or MiniSD card even thought they often times come with an adapter 
and will work for your phone under normal conditions. For flashing, it 
must be a plain SD card formatted with the Fat32 (not Fat) file system. 
If your Olympus camera is a few years old then it most likely has the 
type of SD card you need.

Even if you don't find anything I'd be very hesitant to install that 
program if you found it semi-randomly off the internet. I believe it's 
been mentioned thats the installer for adobe flash (not the flash player 
but the flash producer), I happen to know from doing lots of installs of 
adobe software at work that ADBEFLPRCS3_WWE.exe is the name of the adobe 
flash installer (name is an abbreviation for Adobe Flash Producer 
Creative Suite 3 World Wide English) which is a proprietary program that 
costs a few hundred bucks full retail. All commercial adobe products 
(like this one) all require serial numbers for the activation checks, 
even the volume license (AOO) versions, and if it installs without a 
serial number it has *definitely* been modified. Now I don't care if you 
use a cracked program or not but generally cracked programs (especially 
really expensive programs like this one) usually have lots of malware 
hidden in them that can really mess up your system.

   1996 or 1997? That's when the 1.2 megapixel cameras were quite expensive.

   Let's see ... here are the three. They're labeled "SmartMedia" and I have
a 4M, 8M, and splurged for a whopping 32M card. :-) This shows how long ago
I bought them. Probably all too small for the upgrade.

Thanks,

Thanks. I kept looking for strings in Synaptic, not realizing that it
is part of Linux and not a separate program.

Now that I know that I ran strings on the file. I did not see anything
evil in the output. On the other hand, I have been running the computer
(including several reboots) for two days without it, and everything
still works. So to hell with it. It's history.

Thanks for the education about strings. Another tool in my Linux kit.

Russell,

   Good to know. If I go to OfficeDepot, for example, to buy a SD card, what
should I look for to determine if it's formatted FAT32 and not something
incompatible?

Thanks,

Doesn't matter what it's formatted as from the store. You can reformat 
them anyway you like. For this, it needs to be Fat32 though. I would buy 
a 1GB card as they will be the cheapest. You're not going to get 
anywhere near as good a price at a shop like that though. You might want 
to call around before you head out, but that's up to you.

Subject: [PLUG] Embedded Linux / LAMP documentation wiz needed
Message-ID: <2A83D02CF6974BDC8B15B8488039EFD3@tsharplesoffic>

Hi, I have an immediate need for someone with extensive software documentation experience, to create a "master folder" containing everything an experienced software engineer would need to provide continuity for our ongoing software development efforts. We are a tiny company with just a couple of programmers, and everything has been written in an embedded Slackware (blown onto CF's that are installed in our wireless mesh routers), or a LAMP environment that provides back-end support for our installed wireless devices. The code, documentation, comments, and development environments are scattered about on several servers and these need to brought together and documented in a coherent fashion in one master folder.

I'm guessing that this project should take a week or two and I can pay $25 / hr. You'll need to come to Vancouver (directly across the river from the airport) to familiarize yourself with the code-base etc. as needed, and you can have a dedicated workspace here with access to a color laser printer.

If this is something you or someone you know might be interested in, please contact me at the phone number below.

Am I the only one that thinks that pay seems awfully low? It might be
appropriate for a low-end salary, but for consulting work it seems
pretty far below what good quality work pays. Or am out out of touch
with current financial reality?

It's low. It's also all we can afford. Our credit lines are frozen, and 
everything is now cash on the barrelhead.

Rich,

I don't think I've ever run loadkeys as other than root.  The manpage 
seems to indicate that read permissions on /dev/console are the 
controlling factor (read permissions?!), so `ls -l /dev/console` on 
your various systems is probably going to indicate something different.  
Hopefully, you will find that your old system had your user in a group 
rather than having global read on /dev/console (mine has 0600 perms.)

www.mplayer.hu has a package, ALL codecs for win32.  It is the website for
mplayer, but they have the codecs available separately.
Put them in the proper location (/usr/lib/codecs usually), and Totem may or
may not be able to play it without further fuss.
There may be a specific "plug in" or add on package you need to give Totem
the proper codecs instead,
I know for example in Fedora there are several.
You may need to pull in 3rd party repository for this, such as Livna (this
is true on Fedora, not sure CentOS).

IMHO it is easier and better to use VLC, and mozilla vlc plugin.

I'm sending this from the Comcast web mail interface, using my laptop. At the clinic today I changed my desktop machine from a static IP address to DHCP so I could connect from Free Geek. All was well.

When I got home, I changed back to a static IP address. Now, I can't get past my router. I can ping the router, and I can ping my laptop. I don't think I changed anything else. The gateway address is the correct one for the router. To be more accurate, I didn't change back to a static IP address right away. I didn't think of it at first. However, even with DHCP, I still couldn't get past my router. I've tried ifconfig eth0 down/up with no change.

Any ideas on how to tell the machine it's home again?

Dick,

A quick test would be to turn off your firewall completely in the machine in
question.
If things then work, it means you need to change some firewall settings.
Don't forget to turn it back on.

I concur with the /etc/resolv.conf possibility.
More than likely, when you connected by DHCP, the DHCP server gave your
machine a new resolv.conf file, and when you get home that doesn't work
anymore.  I have run into this, and for laptops that move between networks I
usually keep a backup of my resolv.conf for when I go back home to my static
IP setup.

Sure enough, resolv.conf was changed by dhcp at Free Geek. It has: 

search fglan 
nameserver 192.168.253.11 
nameserver 192.168.253.12 

I have no idea what resolv.conf had before that, and it looks like a backup copy was not made by dhcp. I Linux-Googled [resolv.conf Ubuntu] and found that some other folks have had this problem. I tried copying the concepts they used. Here's what's in resolv.conf now: 

iface eth0 inet static 
address 192.168.0.253 
netmask 255.255.255.0 
network 192.168.0.0 
broadcast 192.168.0.255 
gateway 192.168.0.1 

(Their example was for 192.168.1.x.) 

After saving that, they recommend: 

sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart 

I did that, but it didn't seem to help. 

Does that resolv.conf look right, or is there something missing? 

Now that I know that 

search fglan 
nameserver 192.168.253.11 
nameserver 192.168.253.12 

are from Free Geek, when I look at System>Administration>Network from the Ubuntu menu, I see that I needed to remove them from the DNS Servers and Search Domains sections of Network Settings. I don't know what should go back, though. Would that be something like comcast.net? 

Thanks for all the help.

The search domain is unrelevant in your case. You need to find out what DNS
servers your router uses, and put them into resolve.conf after "nameserver"
on each line.

You should remove the rest of the stuff you put in there, that is not
resolv.conf material.

Here are some comcast DNS servers you can try, if your router doesn't have
other settings:

68.87.69.146
68.87.85.98
68.87.78.130

or, you can try your router's address itself (192.168.0.1), in case it is
acting as a DNS gateway as well.

Or the easiest way to write a correct resolv.conf file is to let your
router do it for you.  Set up your laptop to DHCP and get a lease from
your router.  Voila!

Bingo. Here's what it did:

cat /etc/resolv.conf
search comcast.net
nameserver 192.168.0.1

Then, I switched back to static IP address, and all is well, again.

Thanks for the tip.

Thanks to all for chipping away at this one.


For the benefit of the archives:
When I take the box to the clinic,

1. Copy resolv.conf to resolv.conf.home
2. Change from static IP address to DHCP
3. When I get home, replace the changed resolv.conf with the saved one.
4. Restart networking.

He did try that:

> However, even with DHCP, I still couldn't get past my router.

Also, I would assume there is a reason he uses a static IP setup rather than
DHCP at home. Maybe DHCP isn't configured on his router? Maybe everything
else is set up for static IP on his lan, and the router's DHCP server hands
out IPs that conflict with other machines'?

There are lots of reasons to use Static at home...

On my network, I have configured dhcpd to hand out specific addresses
for specific macaddr's.  That way, I get "static" addresses while
using DHCP.  Works great, so long as you've got a configurable DHCP
server.

Correct me if I am wrong, but, I thought all DCHP servers had this
option.....

Or just do static..

It turns out to be the same.

Just different  methods...of getting there..

No doubt. Perhaps the routers that run Linux inside 
(WRT-something-or-other) could do that.

Sounds like you are referring to OpenWRT(1) and DD-WRT(2), which started off
running on the Linksys WRT54G series routers?
I myself have a Linksys WRT54G v4 (the one that still has Linux internally
as stock, after that they switched to a proprietary OS and less flash RAM
and ROM) running DD-WRT v.24, works like a champ, quite a bit more
configurable than stock, including static DHCP tables among many other
options.
With the newer versions you want to get WRT54GL, which just means it has the
necessary amount of RAM and ROM to run the configurable (and open) Linux OS
on them.  DD-WRT and probably OpenWRT also support many of the newer routers
that are draft-N capable, check the compatibility lists before you buy one
though.
In any case the WRT54GL are not too terribly expensive, and with one of
these more open firmware OS on it you can do almost anything the "big boys"
can do, still in a nice compact and not too power hungry enclosure.

Subject: [PLUG] Suggestions for _really_ small business data backup
Message-ID: <48FDFAA2.1030903@acm.org>

I have a customer that for years was able to do their backup by creating 
an CD ISO image (mkisofs) and burn it (cdrecord).  Over the last few 
months it has been failing off and on for no distinctly discernible reason.

The next test is to replace the CD-RW drive but I've tried the process 
with an external CD-RW and still get the same kinds of results.

Tape drives are too expensive and, in my experience, not always reliable 
without _lots_ of TLC.  In fact I moved them from tape backup in a 
desktop system, that had never been tested by actually restoring, to the 
CD-RW and it worked like a charm -- or several years.

I'm considering SD or thumb/jump drives as they will hold all their 
foreseeable data needs or even Bakula over the network to an off site 
system.

Are there other (_very_) inexpensive backup options?  Well besides hope 
and prayer.  :-)


TIA,
Rod

Rod,

   That probably depends on the drives. I've been using Tandburg drives for
the past 10 years; the SLR/60 has worked flawlessly for at least 7 years now
with periodic cleaning. And, it tells me when it wants to be cleaned. I use
bru as the software and have done partial and full installs to new hard
drives without losing any data. YMMV. That said, ...

   I'd go for a separate hard drive (perhaps on a USB connection) with
Keith's pet 'dervish' (about which I know nothing) or tar.

Sounds like they're always doing full backups now. Have you considered
splitting the backups to a periodic (weekly) full backup, and more frequent
incremental backups?

How much data?
How fast does the data change?
Are they backing up pertinent data or shotgun backup of the whole/portion of
the filesystem?

Take a look at what the 'footprint of disaster' they need to be recoverable
from. For example, if the backup media is in the same computer, a single
failure (cup of coffee disaster) can make it go away; in the same room, a
small fire makes it go away; the same building.... ; the same city.... ;
etc.

Does the data need to be encrypted? How do you safely backup decryption
key(s)?

Where are the human bottlenecks? How many people know how to do backup? How
many people know how to restore?

There's always a lot of talk about the right tool(s) to do the backup, and
sometimes the process gets overlooked. If you have great tools in place, but
the process isn't well defined and implemented, then the system doesn't
work.

And I have a tape drive that has been very reliable for about 5 years
and shows no signs of imminent failure. And it wasn't new when I got it.

But tape drives and media are expensive; you can get a hard drive or USB
flash drive for a LOT less.

I'm setting up rsnapshot for a client this week. I like it. It is
similar to dervish in many ways; uses links to save space, cycles
between full and incremental backups in a configurable way, etc. 

A little analysis (as described in an earlier reply) will help you
determine whether or not you need this much complexity. A 2.5" USB hard
drive might be better than rsnapshot, with the existing scripts adapted
accordingly.

As far as I know, still tzdata - that is, on my Hardy x86_64 computers.
I base that on the fact that every time some rooster wakes up late in
Lower Dungistan there is a new tzdata file in Update Manager. In fact,
I think I had a new one just the other day.

Under Ubuntu 8.04 you use "tzselect" to display timezones and (according
to the manpage) "dpkg-reconfigure tzdata" to change the timezone.

Get an external hard drive. Or get a couple and have the person rotate 
them weekly for off-site protection.

Or just buy a couple 1GB thumb drives for <$20 and do the same thing.

Backuppc does similar tricks w/ hard links to conserve space,
and has a pretty luser-friendly GUI for restorations, if that's
of interest. Handles multiple hosts, using samba or rsync or tar,
and also has an archiving function, so you can spit a snapshot
out onto a removable.

Used it for years. On sourceforge. Two thumbs up.

My thanks to all of you for your very excellent suggestions and 
observations.

I should have gone on-site before posting because it turned out to be a 
case of fat fingers on my part.

This is a small office, just three people, with _some_ computer 
knowledge.  The problem was my fix to another issue  missed a leading 
slash for redirection of STDOUT.  A script was failing not the backup.

I have a simple script they run in the morning "goodmorning" that gives 
a non-threating welcome message, mounts the CD, displays the root level 
directories, then ejects the CD.  They put in a new CD and it is ready 
for the next days back up.

The missing slash seems to have caused the mount to fail ... go figure eh?

The backup is done with a script via a cron.

Again thanks to all for the suggestions and ideas.  I still suspect they 
will have to move on something else as their data grows.  And now I know 
others see the same choices I do.

Is there still a Telenet?  I am looking for a phone number where
I can get plain ol' terminal access, without the baggage of a browser.
I used to use it for libraries and schools, but seems hard to find now.

Message-ID: <c834ec80810231526w675947efl14437df6b6fd3ae3@mail.gmail.com>

I bit the bullet yesterday and stood in line (with a whopping 4 other
people ;) to get an Android G1, and now that the novelty has worn off
(ok, it really hasn't -- not even close) I'm starting to dig into the
more geeky aspects.

The phone uses a MicroSD card for bulk storage, and it mounts up over
usb just fine under Windows XP (just like a thumb drive), however,
under Linux, I've been unable to identify a partition to mount.  This
is what fdisk reports as the partition table:

$ fdisk /dev/sda

Command (m for help): p

/dev/sda shows up in dmesg when I plug the phone in but no partitions
are identified there either.  (The behavior is exactly the same if I
use the microSD card in a usb card reader.)

I'm not sure where to go with this, does anyone have suggestions?

(For what it's worth, it's trivial to add music / pull off images /
etc. from windows.)

Try mounting /dev/sda directly. There's really no reason to have a partition 
table, that's just "how it always was" so when you buy a flash device these 
days they tend to have one large partition.

The output from fdisk looks like it's reading some filesystem blocks and 
thinking it's getting a partition table.

I imagine its using FAT32. Is the kernel module loaded to support that file

Yes that could be.  To get more information about the
partition/filesystem you can try:

  file -s /dev/sda

Install The SleuthKit (apt-get install sleuthkit) and run:

  mmls /dev/sda

Wouldn't just
   # fdisk -l /dev/sda

Tell you everything you want to know?

Or maybe I'm missing something (again?).

I don't know what Telenet is/was.
But if you want plain old terminal access, here is one place you can go:
http://sdf.lonestar.org/index.cgi

Note this isn't an ISP, you still need to have your regular ISP access, this
provides free UNIX shell accounts (via telnet).

Besides what kind of info are you trying to access?  If you have an ISP
account who says you have to use a web browser?
Pop open a bash shell and run lynx, mutt, ssh/telnet etc, all work fine.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenet

i can't tell from that article if it's still around, and i haven't
heard anything about it since the mid-90's.  that doesn't necessarily
mean a thing as to its continued operation though =)

> But if you want plain old terminal access, here is one place you can go:

funny thing is, i did dial in to sdf.lonestar.org at 2400bps back in
1992 with a terminal program, which sounds like what Miles is looking
for.  this was before they were even on the internet in realtime (they
had a high-falutin' 21.6kbps UUCP feed for usenet and email).  they're
a stellar operation, and have been free all this time, so definitely
look into them if you need a shell account somewhere.  but i don't
think they do dialup these days...even if they do, they are based in
texas, so it probably won't be a free call.  you'd probably be better
off doing dialup with someone like earthlink who has local access
numbers and then just running a program like putty to access sites
like SDF.

mute at sdf.lonestar.org for 16 years and counting..

That *obviously* begs the question: Can you run a 2400bps modem over skype? ;)

Well, in many cases yes, but I personally like the output of mmls better
and it supports the following partition types:
	dos (DOS-based partitions [Windows, Linux, etc.])
	mac (MAC partitions)
	bsd (BSD Disklabels [FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD])
	sun (Sun Volume Table of Contents (Solaris))
	gpt (GUID Partition Table (EFI))

I'm not sure that fdisk does support all of those.

> Or maybe I'm missing something (again?).

Also, the 'file -s ...' command can give you info about the filesystem
that's on the drive if there is no partition table at all.  Both fdisk
and mmls kinda keel over in that case.

Oh, also, if the previously suggested inspection tools fail you, you
could try the tools 'gpart' and 'testdisk', both of which are designed
to recover filesystems off of disks when the partition table becomes
corrupt or is overwritten.  This is obviously not the case for you, but
they may be able to identify common filesystems starting in the middle
of the disk even if you can't figure out what partition table is being
used.

Please post back if you figure out how things are laid out... I'm
interested to know myself. =)

What are you looking for, specifically? Your needs may possibly be served by
a dialup BBS with a net connection. There are some still around in each
area.

Stupid pdx.edu won't let me attach more than 20 MB file. Neither will
my Comcast.net account. 

I know there are file sharing sites, but the several I looked at wanted
you to agree to let them spam you forever to create an account. Does
anyone have any experience with a decent file sharing site so I can
just send students a link to the voice recording they need for our
linguistics class?

  I worked for Telenet back in the 90's.  They got purchased by Sprint
International, and then got transferred to Sprint Data.  The X.25 data
service is probably still around.  It was really popular for overseas
connections.

  I don't know if the terminal PAD service is still being sold.  It
was crazy expensive compared to a dial SLIP connection.  Anyone with
more brains than money converted to SLIP years ago.  You may want to
look for an dial ISP with a shell account.

If you are looking for a ISP with shell access, Infinity Internet. They 
shut telnet access down a while back, but you can use ssh. Infinity 
Internet now includes the old Pacifier On Line out of Vancouver.

I think he wants to dial up with a comm program and go directly to a shell
prompt. IInet/Pacifier offered this service until about 5 years ago. (I
worked there at the time.)

I would imagine (there I go again) that if all that was needed was a shell
account + dialup service, any old dialup service and shell account combo
would do. IInet's prices would be a little much just for this.

Instructor is not available until next Tuesday. But even if I could get
hold of him, how can I send him the file?

As a student I do have the option of putting it on my H drive or my I
drive. I have put files on both in the past, but I'll be damned if I
can figure out now how I did it. I have a GUI FTP client (gFTP), but it
has no documentation and I can't figure out what goes in the various
boxes. I looked in Synaptic for something else, but all I can find is a
command line tool that is already installed. I read its man page, but
after trying several commands that don't work I gave up. Too many
options that I don't understand the purpose of.

With Firefox I can see a file that I placed on my I drive last spring.
It is a large TIFF file, and I don't need it any more. But now I can't
even figure out how to delete it. If I even try to select it, it
automatically starts to download the file. (And yes, I am logged in.) 

I tried just dragging the file I want to send from Nautilus to the I
drive folder in Firefox. The file is an .mp3 and Firefox decided I
wanted to open it in a window and play it with mplayer.

The PSU online instructions are only for Windows ("go to network
neighborhood ...") and MacOS, using their GUI network utilities. 

This is just frustrating and stupid.

Dunno about free file hosts specifically, but there are some free web
hosting providers that might not abuse you. I cringe at mentioning it, but
1asphost.com qualifies. It's owned by Dotster, where I used to work.

Alternatively, if you don't find a better solution for you, I volunteer to
host it for you on my web server.

technically, shell access is only offered to dial-up customers and higher. I
remember when my shell access was revoked as I only had an email account at
the time. I went on vacation a while back and upgraded to dialup for a week.
When I downgraded again, my shell access wasn't re-revoked. The shell server
still thinks I have a dialup account (shhh). I'm guessing something similar
happened to you. But if someone signed up for an email-only today, I'm
pretty sure they wouldn't get shell.

Thanks for the offer. I'll keep it in mind.

Right now I have finally managed to get it uploaded to my PSU web site.
And I have created an index.html page for the site. Unfortunately, I
can't get the download link in the html to work. 

I finally got gFTP to work. (Had to search all over PSU's help pages to
find the correct ftp URL.) But the problem is that gFTP is not telling
me the truth, or not all of it. I can create the link on the web page,
but when I upload the index.html file and click on the link to download
I get an error message that the file cannot be found. If only gFTP had
a "properties" option for the file that would tell me its real location.

Another part of the problem is that I know next to nothing of html, so
I am creating the index.html file in OOo.

At least this part is educational. :)

(And no, I really do NOT want to learn any more about html than I
absolutely have to.)

well, you're going to have more issues if you keep going at it that way. the
FTP location and the HTTP location are most often 2 different things. you'll
have to learn where the common point is (usually your home directory) and
extrapolate from there. if you want, you can post the addresses of what you
have (index.html and mp3 file) and we can try to guess what's wrong with it.

OO.o Word Processor "helps" you when you save to html. I just tried 
copying the text of one of my index.html files into OO and saving as 
html. The result has a lot of html code that I didn't write. Much 
cleaner is to use a text editor. On Ubuntu, gedit is the GUI text editor 
that doesn't add things it thinks you need.

Yes, I understand what you are saying - and I agree because I have seen
OOo's "helpful" code. But in this case OOo is not messing with the URL.
That is, I try a different URL, save the file, upload the new version
to my http://web.pdx.edu/~johj/public_html folder, then reload the page
in Firefox. Firefox correctly sees the changed URL, and if I View
Source in Firefox I can see the <a hrf ...> code correctly reflecting
the URL that I told OOo to make a link to. OOo also allows me to edit
the source, and when I do so I see the URL is correct. That is, it is
not correct, but it is at least what I told OOo to use. In this case it
is a PBKAC error, not a software error.

The most logical URL for this file is

http://web.pdx.edu/~johj/public_html/VOICE004.MP3

But that just gives 404 errors, as do all other variations I have
tried. That is the folder where the index.html file resides, and
browsing with gFTP I can see the VOICE004.MP3 file plain as day.

I have double and triple checked for everything from typos to folder
errors, but every URL I have tried gets a 404 error. 

I e-mailed PSU's help desk hoping they could explain - in case the real
URL is someplace else. Unfortunately, they misunderstood my question
and assumed I had lost the file. 

I'll be on campus this afternoon. Maybe I can go a bit early so I can
sit down at the help desk and show them the problem. That will also
allow me the satisfaction of bitching at them about the 20 MB
attachment limit.

that would be because the correct URL is
http://web.pdx.edu/~johj/VOICE004.MP3 and you are linking to something
entirely different (it has a /home/ and a /public_html/ that are both
unneeded).  i assume the file is there because i get a permission
denied at that URL instead of a file not found.  can you change
permissions in your ftp client?  something like "site chmod 744" would
work in my ftp client, and maybe yours as well.

Remove "public_html/" from that, and I think you've got it.

Thanks! That does seem to be working.

However, gFTP is not cooperating with my attempt chmod the file.
Right-clicking on it shows an option to chmod it, but when I tell it to
do so gTP opens a dialog box that just has checkboxes for what kind of
person can do what with the file:

Special	User	Group	Other
----------------------------------------------
Read	Read	Read	Read
Write	Write	Write	Write
Execute	Execute	Execute	Execute

The dialog box does not offer a line where I can specify "744." I guess
I need to figure out a different way to chmod it.

On further thought, I wonder if I could password protect it. It occurs
to me that the file is a recording of a subject in a dialect study. I
have permission to use his voice data for academic research purposes,
but not to make it available to the entire world. I doubt that it would
be a problem, but it would be nicer to have a little control. I could
just make a password and give it to the students who are entitled to
have the file. But password control probably opens a whole new
dimension to the problem.

At least I think I have the URL right now.

This is the right track. Just put a check in Read under the Other column and
you're good to go.

LOL! Well, that sort of worked. I used gFTP's dialog box and checked
the "Other" box for "Read."

But guess what Firefox does now? It opens mplayer and starts to play
the file!

Three steps forward, two steps back.

First off, thanks for all the replies!

I think this was the problem.  (I needed to mount /dev/sda directly.)
Unfortunately, due to a lot of spacing out on my part, I didn't have a
good computer (or time) for diagnosis last night, but the media pc,
which runs KDE, mounted it automatically and everything worked
perfectly.  I'll try to post more details of what's on there, what the
FS looks like, etc. as soon as I have a chance.  (I imagine this is
all also discernible from http://code.google.com/android -- especially
now that the entire software stack is Open!)

In regard to the phone itsself, (disclaimer: my only real point of
reference is my previous phone -- a V3 Razr) it is awesome :).
Battery life is perhaps a tad short given the things I want to do with
it, but over all I'm very happy with it.

I'm eager to dig into the dev kit as soon as time avails itsself, but
I don't have any particular apps in mind.  Are there any other
PLUG-ers who would like to collaborate on something?

that's what you want!  i mean, it may not be what *you* want, but it
means the webserver is sending it and is as properly set up as it will
ever be.  students who want to save the file instead of listening to
it should be directed to right click and "save as".  if you want it
not to autoplay, you'll need to zip it or do something else to make it
not-an-mp3.

Yeah, I thought of zipping it, and I guess that's what I'll have to do.
I just wanted to avoid the complication.

A professor recently asked me to address her class (Phonetics) to
explain to the class how to use the International Phonetic Alphabet on
their computers. I had created ipa4linguists.pbwiki.com last spring,
but the students were having problems with the instructions. The
professor also needed the instruction, so we hooked her laptop up to
the beamer in the classroom and then I proceeded to demonstrate how it
is done. 

Part of the process was to download the Junicode font from
Sourceforge.net. The first problem was that about a quarter of the
class said they clicked the download button on Sourceforge.net, but
couldn't find the file. They didn't know where their browsers were set
to download files to. After downloading it to the professor's computer
we showed them where the file was. Then another quarter of the class
said they had managed to download the file, but it wouldn't install. Of
course, the file is zipped. They had no idea what a zip file is.

You will not go broke overestimating the computer illiteracy of
linguists.

Special thanks to you and Wes for helping me figure it out.

One solution is to create a separate directory on your site and not link 
to it from the main page's index.html file. You give the link to the 
directory to students you want to see it and they can get there. The 
rest of the world won't see it. This isn't good enough for real 
security, but may be good enough for what you are doing. Here's an example:

My personal site is:

http://home.comcast.net/~rsteff/

There are only two links on that page. However, I have a few other 
directories on the site, each with their own index.html file. An example is:

http://home.comcast.net/~rsteff/2007-Bathroom-Remodel/

So, simply make a copy of your current index.html file, edit out the 
Language Variation part of the original and save that. Create a new 
directory called LanguageVariation (or something that makes sense to 
you). Move both the mp3 file and the copy of index.html to the new 
directory, making sure the name is changed back to index.html. Edit out 
the IPA4Linguists part, if desired, and you're done.

I would submit that the "instruct them to right-click and click Save As" is
the standard way to solve this problem. The ZIP method is ok too, but would
not be my first choice.

I see you have the link worked out in index.html. Just put an instruction
above the file. You'll still get people complaining of problems, but I would
imagine (someday I'll learn not to do that) that it would be fewer.

Seconded. I use this very same method on my own site. Have for years, never

It sounds like an excellent solution. In the present instance there are
only half a dozen who need the file and I'll make them do it in the
next couple of days, then delete the file. But this is a great idea and
I have saved it for the next time.

Are there any c++ programmers that know how to access a device connected
to the serial port?  Is there any c++ programming material available
that addresses the com ports?

I have two DGH data acquisition modules that are plugged into ttyS0 aka
COM1.

The command to read data is "$1RD\r" where $1 is the address of the
module, RD is the Read Data command and \r is a carriage return.

Next I need a 30 to 100ms delay while the device takes the reading and
puts it in a buffer.

Then I need to retrieve the data which is in the form '*00019.00\r'

Finally, is there anyone who knows how to do this that is willing to

I left out some important information in my previous message.

The port has to be configured to 4800 baud with the following format.

Data Format
All modules communicate in standard NRZ asynchronous data for-
mat. This format provides one start bit, seven data bits, one parity bit
and one stop bit for each character.

Rich:
Are you sure you are not trying to utilize an application of some sort?
C programming to control a serial port looks like:

/* Finish UART Initalization */
adr = pci_uart_base + LCR_OFS;
outb( DLAB, adr ); // Set DLAB

adr = pci_uart_base + DLLB_OFS;
outb( BAUD, adr ); // Low byte for baud

adr = pci_uart_base + DLHB_OFS;
outb( 0, adr ); // High byte for baud

adr = pci_uart_base + LCR_OFS;
outb( EIGHT_BITS, adr ); // 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop

adr = pci_uart_base + FCR_OFS; // Clear FIFO buffers
outb( (CLEAR_R_FIFO | CLEAR_T_FIFO ), adr);

adr = pci_uart_base + FCR_OFS; // Enable FIFOs with
outb( ENABLE_FIFO, adr ); // 1 byte trigger on interrupts

adr = pci_uart_base + IER_OFS; // Enable interrupts in UART
outb( 3, adr );

========================================
A pretty good site with useful information on the personal computer 
serial port is:

Paul posted some code for his dorkbot project that included a library
that autodetected the serial port.  He has the source code available
at his site.

I don't think Rich is looking for autodetection of the serial port, he
wants to interact with a device on the far side of a serial port.
Send a query, effectively, get a reply.  I did something very similar
for a data collection project last spring, which was the last-minute
subject of a PLUG talk.

The autodetection is a bonus feature of the library.  It's a C++
serial communication library that is simple enough to figure out how
it works.

Is there a typical email alias for the guy who is in charge of the
hardware for a website?  You have your postmaster, hostmaster, and
abuse aliases, but these all seem software related.  What about the
hardware/infrastructure guy?

That one is pretty good, but "IT" has a corporate ring to it which
makes my skin crawl a bit (I guess 5 years in corporate IT settings
has left me jaded).  And the website I have in mind is for a
family-owned business.

If there isn't a standard, I think I'd go with something that is more
directly hardware-related, like "hardware".  Still open to suggestions
though!  I see posts on google that hint at the fact that "postmaster"
is mandataed by an RFC.  Does anyone know which one?

It doesn't really work in this case, since I am the admin in all areas
except hardware.  I answer to postmater, hostmaster and abuse, for
example.

One would suspect that 99.9% of websites don't have a specific alias
for hardware/infrastructure.  Maybe I should just give the guy an
email acocunt with his name.  It doesn't seem like the RFC cops would
hassle me for that.  I found the RFC in question (2821, or Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol), and it only mentions postmaster.

When I feel the urge to send a spam or abuse report to a particular
connectivity provider (I assume they are fairly infrastructure-heavy)
the address that most often comes up is 'dns@<domain>'. 

That's what I'd use.

Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20081027100018.068ec8d0@landongxi>

This may be rambling, but I've not had much sleep in a week. We had a our 
data center burn, and I've been trying to pick up the pieces since then.

We need to reconnect N site servers (satellite, below) to a central openvpn 
server, with each satellite supporting Windows clients, providing local 
DNS, DHCP, and the vpn tunnel to the corporate network. So this, in other 
words:

client -- satellite -- VPN over DSL -- VPN Server -- corporate network stuff

The problem I'm having, and this is lack of sleep, I'm sure, is that while 
the tunnel is up, and the site server can see the central corporate LAN, 
the client machines on each of the satellite LANs cannot, and I cannot see 
to them from the corporate LAN or any other satellite LAN. So Something's 
wrong with routing/forwarding, and I just don't have it in my brain to 
figure out. Has anyone done net-to-net openvpn, who could

Current sites are arcane builds of Debian (blech) and we're trying to roll 
out a clean CentOS replacement, to get around my predecessor's iptables and 
other cruft that is I think getting in the way. The central server is 
Smoothwall express, with the "experimental" Zerina build to manage openvpn.

Anyone have hints or time to help/advise?

Is IP forwarding enabled on the satellite boxes?

Have you verified the routing tables on the satellite boxes?

Is the satellite box doing masquerading for the clients? If not, do 
you have static routes set up on the VPN Server that let the corporate 
network stuff get packets to the satellites and clients?

Is the satellite box set as the default router for each client?

"route -n" is your friend.  Every server must have routes to all
the other servers and nets they need to reach, routed through the
appropriate tunX interface.  My central server, connected to 5
other machines, has about 30 routes in it.

Openvpn calls scripts to add the routes.  There client .conf
script should have a line that looks like:

      up ./client_to_server.up

That file ( also in /etc/openvpn) looks like

--------------- client_to_server.up ----------------------
#!/bin/bash
route add -net 172.98.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw $5
route add -net 172.98.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw $5
route add -net 172.98.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw $5
----------------------------------------------------------

There is a corresponding script (with different routes, of course)
on the server.  You will have to fool with the routing to get 
everyone playing together. 

Note, you don't have to get this all exactly right in the scripts
the first time.  In order to experiment, you can start openvpn
without routes,  then issue the same route commands manually
from the command line, as root, and see what goes where.  Remember,
you have to have valid routes for both ends of each path, and from
all ends to all other ends.

You can probably combine some subnets for simplicity;  my network
is small enough (and enough routes are blocked between machines)
that I set up each route separately.

I'd say that the satellite is the most likely villian. It's either 
blocking or failing to route packets between 192.168.5.x and 
192.168.222.x.

a) Are iptables running on satellite? Running "iptables -L" will tell
    all. Any rules or default policies with a DROP or REJECT target are
    suspect...

b) Do the system logs on satellite give any clue?

c) How's your tcpdump-fu? Running "tcpdump host 192.168.222.254" might
    show you if it's the question or the answer that's not getting
    through...

With iptables _off_ on the satellite, it works.

With iptables on, and running "iptables -A INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT"
(from a Net to Net FAQ/Howto) it still fails.

INPUT chain of the filter table has very little to do with forwarding
packets.  You should be more interested in the FORWARD chain.

Subject: [PLUG] Samba configuration on Ubuntu 8.04 for Win98
Message-ID: <490754BC.10508@comcast.net>

I can successfully access files on my XP and Win98 laptops from this 
Ubuntu 8.04 machine. I can't go the other way. When I try from XP I get 
a login dialog that asks for user name and password. I give the user 
name for my Ubuntu machine, and the password, but it is not accepted.

When I try from my Win98 laptop, I get a dialog that doesn't as for a 
user name, but instead lists as a "Resource" \\MOONGUIDE\IPC$ . It also 
asks for a password. The response to my normal user password is, "The 
password is incorrect. Try again."

Running "sudo smbpasswd -a" for my normal user and adding the password 
fixed the problem for XP, but not for Win98.

Any ideas on what section of smb.conf I need to tweak for Win98, or any 
other solution?

When I would get errors similar to what you're seeing, it was usually
because I hadn't defined anything to share in my smb.conf. Something like
this:

[sharename]
        comment = location, purpose, whatev
        path = /path/to/directory
        read only = no
        browseable = yes
        public = yes
        security mask = 0777
        create mask = 0777
        directory mask = 0777
        inherit acls = Yes

Here's the similar section from my smb.conf. "*" indicates entries that 
I did not have before reading your e-mail. I added them, but the results 
are still the same. I assume that 0777 and 0775 are close enough to at 
least be able to connect to the machine.


# provide access to /home/rsteff
[rsteff]
    comment = rsteff home directory
    path = /home/rsteff
    read only = no
    browseable = yes
    public = yes
    security mask = 0775            *
    create mask = 0775
    directory mask = 0775
    inherit acls = yes                    *

OK. This is the somewhat modified version of the stock smb.conf that 
comes with Ubuntu 8.04.

To answer a possible question about printers, I don't have any printers 
directly connected to the Ubuntu machine. My printer has its own network 
interface.


#
# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which
# are not shown in this example
#
# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash)
# is a comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a #
# for commentary and a ; for parts of the config file that you
# may wish to enable
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic
# errors.
#

#======================= Global Settings =======================

[global]

## Browsing/Identification ###

# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
   workgroup = House

Do you get anything interesting in the log file?

Maybe try changing security = user to security = share

Look for possible include files ( in /home/samba perhaps)

Looks like the home directories get special treatment (see the [homes]
section). Try sharing a different directory as a test. Say for example,
create /var/test and share that.

That's all I can think of. good luck.

That works -- partly. I can now access /home/rsteff. I also see 
individual directories that I have declared to be shared using Ubuntu's 
GUI file browser. However, I'm still asked for a password to access 
them, and while the "Resource" in the Win98 login dialog is different -- 
it says \\MOONGUIDE\PHOTOS (or whatever directory I'm trying to access 
-- it still thinks the password is incorrect.

And, I still get the above set of error messages:

[2008/10/28 15:45:25, 0] auth/auth_util.c:create_builtin_administrators(792)

Thanks for the help.

Message-ID: <c834ec80810282317g333f0d64k91336a6435f60c77@mail.gmail.com>

I just ran into a very annoying pathing/environment problem.  I think
it is best explained with a short example:


 |rogue on escher @ 23:09:50 ~/myapps/android-sdk|
$ which update-alternatives
/usr/sbin/update-alternatives
 |rogue on escher @ 23:12:18 ~/myapps/android-sdk|
$ sudo which update-alternatives
/usr/local/bin/update-alternatives
 |rogue on escher @ 23:12:22 ~/myapps/android-sdk|
$ sudo bash
 |root on escher @ 23:13:34 ~/myapps/android-sdk-linux_x86-1.0_r1|
$ which update-alternatives
/usr/sbin/update-alternatives


The "correct" (sbin) version of update-alternatives is found when I'm
running as me (rogue) or as root, but when I run sudo, the
/usr/local/bin version is found.  What PATH is sudo using? (it's
clearly not my PATH, or root's PATH, is it?)  (I thought I was clever
-- and tried sudo echo $PATH, but that seems to expand $PATH before
invoking sudo, so the information doesn't help.)

This is proving to be extremely annoying, since aptitude makes heavy
use of update-alternatives.

Thanks!
Rogan

Nice try on the sudo.  I had the same type of problem not long ago.  You have
to write a simple script that you execute from the sudo to get the info.

Looks like maybe it has to do with sudo being compiled with SECURE_PATH
maybe?

Everything I've googled so far leads in that direction.

The trick I've found is to use umount -l which allows the current operation
to continue, but effectively unmounts the device so that any future
operation won't find it. Then when the current operation finishes, it will
fully release the device and you can safely disconnect it.

Make sure the username you are using to login to Win98 is the same as
the user you set up in smbpasswd.  You only get one chance to supply
this username when you first login.  More than likely you are never
asked for this username either.  Remember, this is a really lame OS, and
doesn't handle multiple users very well.

Perhaps you could blacklist the kernel module (if the support for
firewire is compiled as a module, that is) in /etc/modprobe.conf
and/or modprobe.d/blacklist.  That might require a reboot, though.
You could also try to rmmod the module, but that may fail if you can't
even umount it.

That's all I got.

While the user names on both machines are the same, I wasn't the 
original user on the Win98 laptop, and that user probably did not use 
passwords. I changed the user name and created a password, the same 
password as is used on the Linux machine, when I got the laptop from my 
sister-in-law.

Thanks for the idea.

It is not the user names that are important here you must set the WORKGROUP
On the windows boxes and the samba server to be the same.

Ugh.  That does certainly seem to be the issue.  Thanks for the info!

Now, if only we knew why apt naively assumes that there is only one
update-alternatives, and doesn't use a fully-qualified path.  (That's
what caused this issue with sudo to arise last night.)

fwiw,

Message-ID: <c834ec80810291032k5bb01a1cla917ad2781d91050@mail.gmail.com>

I've finally reached the breaking point with GCJ (the Gnu Compiler for
Java).  I have spent more time trying to fix problems related to gcj
than any other linux-related issue, and it keeps. comming. back.  I
would not be at all surprised to find that gcj has actually wasted
more time than has been spent developing it.

I need to find a way to keep gcj (and it's associated libraries,
etc...) from ever being installed again, but that doesn't seem to be
simple.  The only tip I've found are the instructions for holding
packages here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto but that
doesn't seem to have any effect when I test by trying to install an
application that has a requirement on some gcj library. for example:

$ aptitude install pdftk
<snip>
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  gcj-4.2-base libgcj-common libgcj8-1 libgcj8-1-awt libgcj8-jar pdftk
0 packages upgraded, 6 newly installed, 0 to remove and 135 not upgraded.
Need to get 21.8MB of archives. After unpacking 50.4MB will be used.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n/?] n
Abort.
 |root on gnuwestlake @ 10:12:42 ~|
 $ echo gcj-4.2-base hold | dpkg --set-selections
 |root on gnuwestlake @ 10:13:12 ~|
 $ echo libgcj8-1-awt hold | dpkg --set-selections
 |root on gnuwestlake @ 10:13:22 ~|
 $ echo libgcj8-jar hold | dpkg --set-selections
 |root on gnuwestlake @ 10:13:29 ~|
 $ aptitude install pdftk
<snip>
The following NEW packages will be automatically installed:
  gcj-4.2-base libgcj-common libgcj8-1 libgcj8-1-awt libgcj8-jar
....

I've been using update-alternatives to reset the java version to sun's
java, but that is something that I (literally) have do to on a weekly
basis, since at least some packages seem to reset it for me when they
are installed/upgraded.  There are also many items that need to be
switched with update-alternatives, and I often forget to switch them
all.

Thanks!
Rogan

Rogan,

   While this doesn't answer your ubuntu question, I see that the
pdftk.Slackbuild file uses gcc on pdftk's Makefile.Generic. No java
involved. Strange that ubuntu requires it.

The Makefile.Generic delegates to Makefile.Base, which in turn
delegates to java_libs/Makefile, and that invokes a makefile in each
java package, using ${GCJ} (which is defined in Makefile.Generic).

By Java standards, this is an extremely odd way to structure a
project, and it's quite unfortunate that gcj is so tightly coupled
with the build process.  I would like to use pdftk, but I am not about
to put up with gcj for one application.

   Oh. I've not looked at it for years. I just build new versions when I
upgrade the system and use it.

   I'm sorry it's giving you such a hard time. I've not seen any issues with
gcj, but I've not explicitly used it for anything.

More confusion.

While I can see some of my Linux machine from my Win98 machines, I can't 
see everything that I expect to see. Plus, directories that should be 
similar get different results.

Example: I have a directory called /home/rsteff/photos that is a mount 
point for one of my partitions. I have another directory called 
/home/rsteff/music that is a mount point for another partition. Both of 
these partitions are mounted at boot time via fstab entries. If I 
navigate to those directories from either the GUI file system browser or 
from a terminal window on the Linux machine I see what I expect to see.

 From my Win98 machines I can see a list of directories shown as music, 
photos, rsteff. If I click on the folder icon next to either music or 
photos I get a password dialog, but if I click on the folder icon next 
to rsteff I change directory to /home/rsteff. Once there, I can navigate 
to photos and look at its contents, but if I navigate to music, it looks 
like the directory is empty.

Checking the properties of both directories I don't see any obvious 
differences, other than permissions, but either should be sufficient to 
show the contents. (I did try chmod 777 music, but it didn't affect 
being able to see the directory from Win98.)

My thought before doing that was that it would be a major change to a 
lot of files and I ought to test it somehow. So, I copied one album's 
worth of files to another directory, /home/rsteff/Music. Then, before 
changing ownership on it, I looked for it from my Win98 machine. It was 
there, so that test would not have proven anything. Just for yuks, I 
also looked at /home/rsteff/music from Win98 and found the directory I 
had just made a copy of! I could go through and make copies of all the 
music and put them in Music, but there isn't enough room.

Also for yuks, I deleted the copy and then did a refresh on Win98. The 
copy in music disappeared, too. That's when I remembered the case 
insensitivity of Windows. I changed the name of Music to notMusic, and 
now the files in music are seen from Win98.

Thanks for triggering this re-discovery.

Subject: [PLUG] Resolved: Samba shared directory looks empty from Win98
Message-ID: <49090FD1.8090100@comcast.net>

A clearer explanation of the problem and the solution:

When viewing my Linux machine from my Win98 machine I could see the 
directory /home/rsteff/music, but it appeared to be empty. I created the 
directory music as a mount point to a partition full of mp3 files. I 
might have chosen the name Music, but there was already a directory by 
that name, created during the installation of Ubuntu 8.04.

Windows filenames are case insensitive. My guess is that when WinXX 
finds two files of the same name it will see the first one, and ignore 
the second. Since Music was created before music, I assume that's why it 
saw the empty directory. I suppose that I should have just made Music 
the mount point, but at the time I was still new to Ubuntu and didn't 
know if some program would try to use Music later on.

Lesson: remember that case matters to Linux but not to Windows and plan 
accordingly if the Linux machine will be part of a network that includes 
Windows machines.

This was from a package of blank CD-R previously known to work?

I've (seemingly) gotten different results in Linux from one CD-RW drive 
after taking it out of the case and hanging it on an external ide-usb 
enclosure.  If you have a usb enclosure handy that might be worth 
trying.  I suppose that might point to an issue with the onboard ide?

As I write this the torrents are downloading for 32- and 64-bit

going fast - shouldn't take more than an hour for all four. I'll have
them with me at the next Clinic.

Having just installed Hardy Heron, my first install of any Ubuntu, 
what's the recommended philosophy regarding upgrades? Should I switch to 
II right away, or is it better to let it mellow for a month or more?

How good is Ubuntu about not messing with stuff I would expect to be

installed from source? Will it figure out which ones I've installed from 
synaptic and from Applications>Add/Remove?

I've been using Ubuntu steadily for several years and usually upgrade
within a few days of the release of a new version. But before I do the
upgrade I download and burn the live CD for it and give it a try.
Sometimes I'll wait as much as a month if I am in the middle of
something at school where the computer is critical to me.

Every time I have upgraded I have found that all my installed
applications ran just fine afterwards, with only an occasional
exception. For example, after upgrading from Dapper to Gutsy I
discovered that drag and drop of text no longer worked in OpenOffice.
That was because the upgrade to Gutsy also upgraded OOo. After
considerable research I discovered that the problem was limited to only
a handful of x86_64 users. Bug reports were filed, but there were so
few of us affected by it that no fix was available until I upgraded to
Hardy. None of us ever figured out exactly how Ubuntu screwed it up,
but we did determine that it affected all versions of OOo - even going
back to the previous version or installing a new version of OOo did not
help. And it affected only Ubuntu x86_64 users; there were no reports
of the problem when using any other distro or 32-bit users. The strange
part is that I had reports from dozens of Ubuntu x86_64 users who were
not affected by the problem. 

The point I am laboriously trying to make is that the dist-upgrade will
also upgrade the applications that come with Ubuntu. Sometimes the new
version of one of these applications will have issues. However, that is
rare. More likely the new version will have new features, work better,
or solve problems that the old version had.

The dist-upgrade will not upgrade any applications that are not
automatically installed by Ubuntu. I have lots of programs that I have
installed and I have never had a problem with any of them after a
dist-upgrade.

As for the operating system itself, I have never had a new version fail
to work at least as well as the old one with my hardware. And usually
the dist-upgrade fixes something that has been a problem. For example,
my bluetooth mouse dies every couple of days and I have to reconnect it
from the terminal. But I just tried the Intrepid CD and I note that the
GUI for connecting bluetooth devices is completely new, plus it took me
only a moment to connect the mouse while running the live CD. I am
hoping that the dead mouse problem has finally been fixed too. 

I do not use VMware, but I do use Vitualbox. I have found that whenever
I upgrade a kernel - even just an update - I cannot run any of my guest
OSs until I go into Synaptic and install new headers for Virtualbox. 

And one more story is worth relating. Once about a year ago I was doing
an apt-get dist upgrade and I lost my network connection in the middle
of it (thanks a lot, Comcast). The result was a godawful mess that took
days of help from people on this list to repair. I learned a lot about
repairing broken systems, but life would been nicer if it hadn't been
necessary. So don't try it if you are in a coffee shop on their
sometimes flaky wireless connection. Also, it takes quite a while for
all the stuff to download, so speed of the connection is also important.

I plan to upgrade my laptop to Intrepid this weekend. Meantime I am
watching the Ubuntu forums. If there are any problems they will show up
there for sure.

That may be the issue I'm having with Samba. I'm finding some things on 
the web that suggest that Samba has had significant changes since the 
version that installed on SuSE 10.1. I have some time today so I'm going 
to try to chase that one down.

I should also have mentioned that Intrepid has made some rather drastic
changes to the way video is configured. For example, as I understand
it, there is no longer an xorg.conf file. Hence a word of warning to
those who have had problems getting their video set up in the past. You
folks should definitely run the live CD first. In my case it found the
nVidia chip in my laptop and automatically set it up just fine. But in
my desktop (nVidia GeForce 6150 on the motherboard) it failed to detect
the chip at all.

Ubuntu upgrades have *always* broken something for me.  Usually audio
fails to work, but once in a while the printing system will just stop
sending data to devices, or some other thing will go wrong.

Power management has never worked properly after an upgrade, but that
has been tied to the UI layer since I've been using Ubuntu (3-4 years
now) and I don't like the default UI options, so that has always been
an issue of sorts.

The issues are not much worse than any other distro (Debian's stabler
two editions are better, IMO).  Overall, I've been disappointed with
some of the decisions the Ubuntu folks have made inorder to meet their
self-imposed release schedule.  I'd much rather get it when it's
ready, rather than getting whatever they have at 6-month intervals.

Ew. Good tip, thanks. I was going to leap and upgrade this weekend, but I
think I'll play it a bit cautious.

Any Linux experience with an external USB DVD burner?

The burning part of the drive in my XP laptop makes coasters; the reader 
part seems OK. I've never had a burner on my Ubuntu desktop, so I'm 
wondering if it makes sense to get an external DVD burner so I can use 
it with either machine.

I've used one that Just Worked--showed up as a scsi drive (as all usb
drives do) and worked just as well as an internal with dvdrecord
(which is the backend for most (all?) of the gui burning programs
too).  I'm not convinced enough that they are all so well-behaved to
put money on it, but I suspect they are.  Of course there will
somewhere be an exception that proves the rule...

Hi:

I have launched wireshark on my Linux box and trying to capture and analyze
network traffic.
What I want is not to analyze the Linux box to/from network traffic but
analyze other box(es) on the network and
their traffic to/from the outside world as well as to/from the linux box.

So far, all I could capture is to/from the Linux host to/from any boxes on
my network but fail
to capture any traffic out of other boxes to other hosts.

Does anyone know the right filter rules for doing that?
A few years ago, i was able to do that with ettercap when Wireshark was
still known as Ethereal
but things have been re-arranged and I don't see to find the docs for
describing that.

Thanks

If your network uses a switch to connect computers together, you won't be
able to see any traffic to/from any boxes other than the one you are running
wireshark on. A switch only sends traffic to its destination, not to
anywhere else. You will need to either use a hub to connect to the machines
you want to monitor, or configure your switch to set up a monitoring port,
if it supports that.

You'll want to read about the differences between switches and hubs.

Hubs distribute all of the data they receive to all the network 
devices to which they are connected:

   http://www.networkclue.com/hardware/network/switches-vs-hubs.aspx

Switches on the other hand, need to be specifically configured with 
port mirroring for a single machine to see all traffic. Different 
networking vendors use differnt terminology for this configuration 
(SPAN port, Roving Analysis Port, ...).

Chances are, your Wireshark machine is connected to the network using 
a switch...

To capture the traffic that you are after, you must use appropriate
network gear.  If you want to see the packets that are meant for a
different computer, you and that computer must be plugged into an
old-style hub together.  Modern switches have enough brains to route
packets by MAC address to only the port for which the packet is meant.
An old-style hub has none of these brains, therefore all packets hit
all ports.  That's why a lot of network geeks keep an old 10 megabit
hub in their gear bag.

The other option is to do your packet tracing on the gateway machine.
Naturally it sees packets from every computer on the network, for all
packets must go through it.  There is an exception to this: two
computers plugged into the same switch can communicate with each other
directly through the switch, without the packets going through the
gateway.  This is a side-effect of switches having enough brains to
route packets by MAC address, as long as the MAC address is in the
switch's MAC table.  But if you are interested in packets between LAN
machines and the internet, the gateway will see all of them.  But it
is highly discouraged to run wireshark on a machine that has a direct
route to the outside world.  Instead, run tcpdump and open the
resulting dump file in wireshark on another machine.

While all the answers so far have touched upon the basic truth
(sniffing on a hub is trivial), sniffing on a switch is not
impossible.  there are a couple of ways of doing so, one optimal (port
mirroring) and unlikely to be possible on cheap networking hardware,
and one which is technically exploitative behavior and prone to
network interruptions (arp cache poisoning).  nonetheless i have
personally had both working with enough success (from a linux machine)
to debug an issue.  a better explanation and comparison than i'd be
able to make off the cuff is here:

http://www.chrissanders.org/?p=121

ettercap and dsniff are the linux tools i've used in the past.

caveat emptor:  using arp cache poisoning may break your network for
non-trivial periods and will certainly piss off your network
administrator.  but hopefully you're your network administrator and
know how to clean up after yourself.  NB this may involve more than
just rebooting the switch--network clients are lied to and the lie may
take awhile to time out depending on OS/settings.

Vincent,

If you are plugged into a switch, you are wasting your time.
(Unless your switch is one with either a special port or specially
configurable)
If you have your network on a hub, you will be able to see the LAN traffic.

A very helpful resource for creating smb.conf is to be found at:

http://us1.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-Guide/

The first example showed me what I was missing in my smb.conf:

guest ok = Yes.

Other confusion came about from the proliferation of standards. Somebody 
once said, "The great thing about standards is that there are so many to 
choose from." As with Windows, in Nautilus there is a way to mark 
directories so that they may be "shared" by other computers. When that 
is done, they will appear in the tree in Windows Explorer. I had marked 
a few directories that way before my attempts to reconfigure Samba. 
Those entries could be clicked on, but always asked for a password. On 
XP, I could specify the user name, and it accepted my password. On 
Win98, I could not change the user name from IPC$, and not knowing 
IPC$'s password, those attempts to connect always failed. Using

gksu nautilus

I have un-marked the "shared" directories, and they no longer appear in 
Windows Explorer. I had never marked my home directory that way, thus it 
was available from those Windows machines on which the user name is also 
rsteff. Now, it's also available from my wife's machine. I realize that 
it would also be available to the entire Internet if it weren't for my 
router, or to any machine I allow to plug in to my home network. That's 
an acceptable level of security, here.

My needs are simple: I want to be able to get to any files in my Linux 
home directory from any other machine in the house. I don't need to 
share any printers, since my printer is a stand-alone network device. 
The following is my very simple smb.conf:

rsteff at moonguide:~$ cat /etc/samba/smb.conf
#
# Configuration file for the Samba suite based on the Samba-Guide, Samba 
by example
# found at:
# http://us1.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-Guide/
#

#======================= Global Settings =======================

[global]
  workgroup = House
  security = SHARE
[rsteff]
  path = /home/rsteff
  read only = No
  guest ok = Yes
rsteff at moonguide:~$

Thanks to all who offered ideas. Eventually, they got me to search for a 
HOWTO style of setting up smb.conf.

I finally got around to giving this a try. I followed the instructions, 
replacing "edgy" with "hardy" in the appropriate places. In addition to 
IE6,I was given the option of also loading IE7.

IE7 doesn't run well. It starts, but never connects to any web site.

IE6 runs. I was able to log in to the RMLS realtors' web site, check out 
some listings, and log out. There were only two issues: 1) loading of 
images was a bit choppy, and definitely slower than on my XP laptop, and 
2) IE6 did not completely shut down. I had to find kill it from a 
separate terminal window.

While it's not ready for everyday use, it is a step closer to being able 
to work in real estate using Linux.

Thanks for the pointer.

I used to run IE6 on Ubuntu x86_64 with Crossover Office. It ran just
fine. It took a long time to launch it, but otherwise there were no
problems at all. And the launch time was like twice as long as it takes
to launch Firefox, due undoubtedly to the fact that it had to start
WINE/Crossover first.

Having said that, as I recall I ran it in a Win98 bottle, not a 2000 or
XP bottle. I dimly recall that it didn't work as well in other kinds of
bottles.

Crossover Office is not free, but Codeweavers contributes back to the
WINE project. I did this a couple years ago, and the reason was because
at the time getting WINE to run in 64-bit Ubuntu was problematic.
Crossover, however, installed without a hitch.
