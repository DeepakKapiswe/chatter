   I have a first edition (1995) of "Learning the bash Shell" and it's time
to get a newer reference. I see that Powell's has more than the ORA edition
(now in it's third iteration), and I'm seeking recommendations whether to
buy the ORA version or one of the others.

   Any opinions here? (Rhetorical question, eh?)

I like bash.  Here are some of my notes from an early set of 
recommendations for learning about bash.

  http://tinyurl.com/mr957

  An excellent dead-tree book, _Linux Shell Scripting with Bash_
  by Ken O. Burtch provides a comprehensive overview of shell
  programming.

  http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/bash3/index.html

  The O'Reilly _Learning the Bash Shell_ book is generally fairly
  good.  Sometimes it reads like a manual, and sometimes it reads
  like a tutorial.  Particularly valuable are the chapters on
  command-line processing and process handling.

  http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/

  Mendel Cooper, working for The Linux Documentation Project has
  written this rich document which describes a wide variety of
  very useful shell programming features (in bash), as well as
  providing a fair number of practical examples of shell.

  http://www.shelldorado.com/

  This is a useful collection of shell tidbits and tips.

  http://wooledge.org/mywiki/BashFaq

  Contained in this Wiki are a large number of shell snippets (of
  varying quality) which answer any number of "How do I..."
  questions.  I think it's freenode which has #bash (?) and the 
  cantankerous primary character behind wooledge.org hangs out
  here.

  http://partmaps.org/era/unix/award.html  # -- fun

  The gratutitous use of 'cat' (/bin/cat) is a fairly common
  mistake for beginning shell users.  At this site, there is an
  explanation of this and other similar shell faux pas, which can
  help to provide insight into shell programming.

I wrote a few very targetted tips on using (long ago, in a different 
universe) which are little discursive tips for using shell.

  http://linux-ip.net/misc/madlug/shell-tips/tip-0.txt
  http://linux-ip.net/misc/madlug/shell-tips/tip-1.txt
  http://linux-ip.net/misc/madlug/shell-tips/tip-2.txt
  http://linux-ip.net/misc/madlug/shell-tips/tip-3.txt

Here are my suggestions for today on the how to go about learning 
shell:

  * learn pipes; learn them cold
  * separate learning shell from CLI tools (rm, mv, cut, sed)
  * learn how to debug shell (set -x && set -e)
  * learn about using shell variables safely
  * learn how to deal with files and various redirections
  * learn to use the 'test' builtin (or command)
  * learn all about quoting; learn this cold
  * learn looping (while : ; do ... done)
  * learn how parameter expansions work
  * learn the 'find' utility
  * learn how to deal with files safely
  * distinguish aliases, commands and builtins
  * learn different shells: sh, ash, zsh, dash ...
  * now go on to the fancy stuff like locales, forking, xargs
    locking, stat, shell functions

I would conclude with one bold statement.  Don't even bother trying 
to learn how arrays work in shell.  If you get that far with shell 
and are trying to use arrays, then you are probably not using the 
correct language.

Now that I have said that, I imagine that somebody out there will 
likely whip up an amazing use for shell arrays....  In my opinion, 
though they are considerably more headache than they are worth.

Rich, I like the oreilly books, but since the newest version of this book
is v3 and dated 2005, it's not exactly new. If you wanted, you could
register the v1 copy you have and they'll give you 40% off the newest print
version or 50% off the newest e-book version.

Jason,

   I saw that. So, I ordered a copy of Richard Blum's "Linux Command Line and
Shell Scripting Bible, Second Edition" despite the religious implecation.
:-) It's much more recent and has highly favorable reviews.

   I'm a dedicated fan of dead tree versions of books. No assembly or
batteries required, highly portable, no proprietary device required to read,
no restrictive EULA to share or give it away.

Thanks,

Rich

OpenBSD is a free *nix-like operating system that focuses on security, 
correctness and developer freedom. With only two remote holes in the 
default install in over 10 years, OpenBSD has a reputation of being one 
of the most secure operating systems in common use.

This talk will present a basic overview of what OpenBSD is,
and will heavily emphasize what its strengths are. It will also
cover the various methods OpenBSD uses to remain secure.

With OpenBSD 5.1 arriving May 1st, we will also discuss some of its new 
features and improvements.

There is a list of FIPS certified modules located here:
http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm
There are fewer software options there than hardware options though.  What
is your actual security need?  How/where do you intend the encrypted
binaries be retrieved and run?  That will have a lot of bearing on what
tool you choose.

Humbly beseeching PLUG's many hardware gurus:

My spouse's LCD monitor has an intermittent problem that manifests itself 
as a bright pink vertical line, one pixel wide, right down the center of 
the screen.

The obvious questions are: what is the probable cause?  What are the 
reasonable solutions?

The problem is becoming more frequent, and as such it seems 
like time to do something about it.

Thanks in advance-

Probable cause ... failing monitor
Reasonable solutions ... get a new one
    one could send it in for repair, but that is normally more expensive 
than a new one.
    repair usually amounts to putting a new monitor in the old case, or 
most of a new monitor anyway.
That has been my experience so far with ...
    LCD
    LED
    CRT
... although the older CRT models could be worked on a bit more than the 
later ones.
Hope that helps

Sadly, that sounds like a problem with the panel itself, which is very
difficult to fix and expensive to replace (relative to the cost of another
monitor).

Might be interesting to squeeze the top and bottom edges of the monitor
frame.  I'm using JJJ's old monitor, and it has some horizontal black
lines that go away temporarily if I squeeze or torque the frame.

Subject: [PLUG] Pressure on individual health insurance plans (you and me)
Message-ID: <4FA2B9BA.2080906@ambidexter.com>


Hello all,

Sorry for the non-technical topic but it will impact a lot of 
independent contractors.

Regence BlueCross BlueShield of Oregon is putting pressure on individual 
(non group) health insurance plans and they're probably not alone. In 
addition to the usual drop in percentage of coverage, this time they are 
dropping entire doctor networks from the plans and channeling everyone 
to groups that no one I know has ever heard of.

I recall LOPSA (https://lopsa.org/) having a group insurance plan but 
there site only seems to mention group liability insurance.

Is anyone else facing this? Can you think of any group plans out there

Not only are they doing what you mention but the co-pays are increasing
10%.  I am at a loss where to turn as the options available are becoming
more limited.

I assume you guys have looked into health plans through the software
Association of Oregon (www.sao.org).  I know they offer some plans to
members, but I'm not sure if that would suit your purposes.

I'm covered by COBRA at the moment, so my info might be out of date.  I was
previously covered as a member of SAO.  If the Independent Computer
Consultant Association is still around, they might offer something.  Really
though, you don't have to stick with tech organizations.  Some AAA
affiliates offer it, Costco would be a candidate, and for those select few,
AARP.  Generally speaking, the more members, the better the plan.  Let us
know what you find.

                                  Galen Seitz

This talk will introduce you to the joys and pitfalls of programmable
logic design using Verilog.  The focus will be on small designs that
could conceivably be undertaken by hobbyists.  While we could easily
spend weeks on the subject, we will try to cram the following into an
hour and a half or so:

* Overview of PALs, CPLDs, and FPGAs
* Why use programmable logic
* Verilog constructs for synthesis
* Synthesis workflow
* Simulation
* Guidelines for synthesis
* A demonstration

If your digital logic skills are a bit rusty, you may want to brush up
on your understanding of logic gates and D flip-flops ahead of time.
There are *many* sources of info on the net.  Here are couple that may
be useful:

<http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~jdonalds/210/lecture08.html>
<http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~jdonalds/210/lecture12.html>

Many will break for the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne afterwards.

See you there!

Subject: [PLUG] Browsers, Numeric IPs, and apache Virtual Hosts
Message-ID: <20120504001233.GA1886@gate.kl-ic.com>

Apache uses virtual hosts to support many different URLs on
one machine on one IP address.  When you connect to apache
with your browser, the browser provides enough information
to Apache to give you the URL you want.

Question:  If the URL is not in the DNS system, and all you
have is the IP address (say, 1.2.3.4) and the name of the
virtual (say, foobar.example.org ), how do you use firefox
(or other browser) to tell apache at 1.2.3.4 to serve the
foobar.example.org content, or any of the other specific
URLs served by virtual hosts on that machine?

The best way is to provide good DNS, of course, but that
isn't available if all you control is a user account and
a browser.

Greetz Keith,

 : browser)

Many people would not agree that 'curl' is an acceptable other 
browser.  With that disclaimer, I will point out that, you can use 
the --header option to my curl (7.20.1) which will set the 'Host' 
header appropriately:

  curl \
    --trace-ascii diagnosis.txt \
    --header 'Host: linux-ip.net' \ 
    -- http://64.22.109.68/

This does several things:

  1. Connects via HTTP to 64.22.109.68
  2. Adds the HTTP header 'Host: linux-ip.net'
  3. Dumps the ASCII representation of the conversation to a file
     called diagnosis.txt.

It can be quite handy when you are dealing with HTTP services that 
require a bit of diagnostics.  I am not Swiss, however, my Swiss 
army CLI network knife is 'socat' where the HTTP CLI equivalent is 
curl.

 : to tell apache at 1.2.3.4 to serve the foobar.example.org 
 : content, or any of the other specific URLs served by virtual 
 : hosts on that machine?
 : 
 : The best way is to provide good DNS, of course, but that isn't

And also, I agree with Paul Heinlein.  Using /etc/hosts is one way 
to work around this sort of impoverished infrastructural 
environment, should you find yourself so constrained.

Which is what the server uses to decide which virtual host to serve, and 
this is the header your tiny http proxy would need to alter (if one were 
to find or implement such a proxy and run it on localhost, that would be 
very handy for testing and debugging.)

>And also, I agree with Paul Heinlein.  Using /etc/hosts is one way

Alas, /etc/hosts requires root access and must be setup on each of 
multiple machines.  If you happen to be able to run one machine as a 
proxy, I think setting an entry in /etc/hosts would get proxied as such 
with squid as long as the client is letting the proxy resolve domains.  
Then, using the proxy is just a user setting in firefox.  (Not that I 
recommend spending time on this before installing dnsmasq, which 
conveniently reads /etc/hosts and will also be your dhcp server to solve 
the problem of getting itself into your resolv.conf.)

Subject: [PLUG] Asterisk, Sangoma B600D, progress
Message-ID: <20120508174023.GA21482@gate.kl-ic.com>

I've got the Sangoma B600D analog telephone interface card working
with Asterisk.  Yay!

The B600D was $542+shipping from TelephonyWare in Concord California.
It performs signficantly better than the eBay "ChinaRoby" card it
replaced.  The B600D ( 4*FXO connections to telco, 1*FXS connection
to deskset or fax ) has digital hardware echo cancellation.  The
B600D comes with a 30 day "no questions asked" return policy, and
a five year warranty.  They also have real live humans answering
their support email, like the fellow who composed a one page
response to the three support questions I asked.

One unadvertised coolness is that the 2 double FXO jacks light up
with red LEDs, and the FXS with a green LED.  If your phone server
is stuffed into a dark corner, this makes it much easier to plug
the right cords into the right jacks.  Since connecting an FXS jack
to a telco jack (also FXS) zaps the card, this is a Good Thing.

One advertised so-so feature are the two split cables in the box,
which can connect the two 2*FXO jacks on the card to four single
telco jacks.  The cables are only 6 feet long, too short without
extenders, and a lot of wires to deal with.  I built my own cable,
starting with 10 feet of CAT6 and crimping two four-wire RJ11s on
one end and four two-wire RJ11s on the other.  Much less messy,
and no extra connection blocks in between.

You might think that a lightly loaded dual core Pentium with the
highly-regarded OSLEC driver ought to be able to do software echo
cancellation for a cheap card, but we've had no end of trouble
with strangely sounding calls, especially connecting to cell
phones.  The Sangoma folks understand echo cancellation, which is
why customers pay $$$ for their products.  The echo cancellation
firmware for the FPGA on the card is closed source (sigh), but
all their drivers and setup software is open source, built from
source tar files.

Install note: The Sangoma "wanpipe" software expects to modify
the dahdi driver and associated configurations.  The "./Setup"
command in the wanpipe source directory does all the work,  
including installing the rc.d files on redhat-derived systems
(probably also for debian-derived).  It ignores the fxotune (line
and card calibration) information for other cards;  however, it
does overwrite the /etc/asterisk/chan_dahdi.conf file,  losing
the extent and group information.  While ./Setup saves the old
file as /etc/asterisk/chan_dahdi.conf.bak, you may lose that
if you ./Setup twice.  I prefer to "cp -a" old file versions
to [filename].YYYYMMDD[what_it_did] , and I do have backups of
them, but still, I would prefer that the install software was
smarter about preserving prior information.  After repairing
the file, I did a "chattr +i chan_dahdi.conf" so it won't be
overwritten again.

If you want a professional quality connection between Asterisk
and four inbound telco lines, this is a great card.  If enough
of us get these cards, I propose that we pool some money and
purchase one local spare, which we can immediately substitute
for a failed card until Sangoma replaces it under the 5 year
warranty.  Cross-border shipping to Toronto might be slow.

Thanks to Bill Ensley for suggesting Sangoma, and the others
who've helped me with suggestions and deployment.  Next, I 
learn how to set up the programmable buttons and lamp fields
on the Aastra phones I bought.

I'm glad everything went well finally Keith.

The most important question though: is the boss happy?

I would be in for the extra card running around, again, if
there enough users, say 5 or so.

The boss's assistant, who does 90% of the phone work, is happy.
That makes the boss happy.  

Hopefully, the Aastra phones, with more features and programmable
buttons and indicator lights, resembling the key systems of
recent memory, will make assistant rapturous, and boss likewise.

   It appears that many folks have difficulty accessing a USB device (flash
drive, GPS receiver) via a guest OS in qemu-kvm. Has anyone here used
virtualbox to host a guest OS and access the USB ports?

Yes, i've done it with thumb drives, as well as an old HandSpring Visor
(PalmOS PDA) on WindowsXP SP3 and (thumb drive only) Windows7 (64-bit),
hosting on 64-bit Ubuntu 10.11.

Once upon a time, one had to use the closed-source edition of VirtualBox
rather than VirtualBox OSE in order to get USB support. i'm not sure whether
that's still the case.

   Thanks, Joe. I bought win7/home/64-bit just to transfer maps to the Garmin
GPS receivers. I'll install virtualbox this weekend.

It is still the case. And yes, I use VirtualBox with a Windows guest to
access a Garmin Edge 305, so I can attest that it works. It is often
helpful to create a USB "filter" based on the device ID to make sure
VirtualBox grabs the device when you plug it in.

Scott,

   I see that virtualbox is owned by Oracle. I can download and use their
closed source version as long as it does the job; after all, the guest OS is
the ultimate closed source. :-)

   Thanks for the affirmation.

Subject: [PLUG] Messed up USB drive
Message-ID: <20120510155151.43734e6b@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I have an ancient 160 GB USB 2.0 drive that I use to hold movies. I
have too many movies, so today I bought a 3 TB USB 3.0 drive for $140
from Office Depot. This is the Seagate GoFlex Desk that has a lot of bad
reviews re reliability, and has only a two-year warranty. OK, I'm a
gambler. :)

The old drive had one ext3 or ext4 partition (forget which), labeled
"Movies." Foolishly, I did not unmount the old drive before plugging in
and formatting the new drive. The new drive came with NTFS/HPFS and a
bunch of Seagate Windows software. I used Palimpsest to delete the
partition, created a new partition, formatted it ext4, and gave it the
label "Movies." I think that last step was my undoing.

After doing the last step I realized that having two drives labeled
"Movies" would confuse my computer, so I changed the label on the new
drive to "Movies2." My intention was to move all the stuff from the old
drive to the new one, then unplug the old drive and relabel the new
drive "Movies." Some of the movies are being seeded as torrents, so I
was hoping that with a drive labeled "Movies" my bittorrent client
would just see all the files and carry on as though nothing happened.
OK, I'm also an optimist.

At this point the new drive works perfectly, although I can't take
advantage of its USB 3.0 interface because everything I have is only
USB 2.0. However, the old drive will not mount. In addition to my
Fedora 16 laptop (with mini-dick) I have a Lucid desktop. If I plug it
into either computer it does not appear in any GUI file manager. If I
launch Gparted it just goes "Scanning all devices ..." endlessly. The
computers work fine otherwise. And, while Gparted is scanning, if I
unplug the USB cable, it stops scanning and shows the other drives on
the computer. 

It's possible the old drive just gave up the ghost coincidentally with
today's activities. More likely I have messed it up somehow. I need
some suggestions for ways to diagnose the problem.

Never mind. Finally got the old drive to mount. All files copied to the
new drive. All is well.

There is no closed-source version of VirtualBox as of 4.0.  VirtualBox
itself is completely open source (GPL v2).  Oracle offers a
proprietary "extension pack" which add bonus features.

>From https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/News

  December 22, 2010. VirtualBox 4.0 released! Oracle today released
  VirtualBox 4.0, a new major release. It now has an open architecture
  using extension packs and the base package is under GPLv2. See the
  ChangeLog for details.

The base package supports USB 1.1.  The extension pack is required for
USB 2.0.

Paul,

   Ah, so. That's probably where the idea of closed source came from. I need
the extension pack so I will try to make time this weekend to futz with
this.

Much appreciated,

Prior to 4.0 there were two separate versions of VirtualBox available.
The version offered for download from the official web site was the
propietary version.  The source code available for download (the Open
Source Edition) didn't support a handful of features (such as USB).

the screen jumps. How do I make the list of running processes sit

2) At the moment I have Rhythmbox running on my Lucid desktop and I
can't kill it. It does not appear in the list of running processes in
top. Gnome System Monitor does list it, with a PID of 24384, shown as
"uninterruptible." In Gnome System Monitor I right click on it and
select "kill process," but it doesn't die. 

From the command line I did "sudo kill -9 24384" and it took the
command without error, but Rhythmbox remains alive and well.

I know I can kill it if I restart the computer, but I shouldn't have to
do that. So far I'm firing blanks. Any suggestions?

   Stand on its toes.

   Look at results of typing 'ps ax' (without the quotes, of course.) This
shows you all processes: running, sleeping, zombies, etc. 'man ps' for more
information.

Instead of using top or the like, use the ps command.

    'ps ax | grep -i <program_name>'

will print out all the PIDs associated with <program_name>.  I found
that I use it enough -- and typing the | character sufficiently
awkward -- that I made an alias out of it:

    "alias psgrep='ps ax | grep -i'".

It's quite possible that Rhythmbox spawns more than one process when
it runs.  If that's the case, use the ps command to find them.  Then
you can terminate all of them, with extreme prejudice.  :-) It's also
possible that Rhythmbox is set up to respawn itself when it's killed.
Sort of like a videogame monster.  In such a case, there should be
some sort of command line option, like "--kill", to stop it.  At least
I would hope so.

You can always do a Rhythmboxectomy: uninstall the monster and never
install it again.  Then install and use a less annoying music player.

Hope this helps.

1) Top ... top -n 1 ... will do one iteration and stop
2) "uninterruptible" ... maybe that means just that?
3) ps is a possibility?  ps -ef | grep -i Rythmbox | grep -v grep
3.1) the -i is for ignore case
3.2) the -v is to ignore the next pattern (in this case grep) ... that 
last part is optional, of course
3.3) ps list both PID and PPID ... possibly if PID is not "killable", 
the PPID is?  But be careful ... identify the PPID process before 
jumping off the cliff, OK?

example:
    ps -ef | grep -i Rythmbox | grep -v grep
if this tells you that Rythmbox is running as 24384, and the parent is 3001
    ps -ef | grep 3001 | grep -v grep
should help you identify the PPID process

Does any of that help?

Question ... is there a GUI presence on your desktop representing 
Rythmbox?  If so can it not be closed from there?
Question ... if you ps for Rythmbox, who is the owner? is it running, 
sleeping, or zombie? under top, how much cpu and memory is it using?

UNIX and Linux are good solid OS's, but not all applications are worthy 
... i.e., some of them hang badly and then fail to go away in any useful 
way.

Thanks to everyone for the suggestions, especially the suggestions for
making top sit still. That will be helpful in the future.

As for Rhythmbox, none of the suggestions helped kill it. The ps
commands listed it, but no parent process or any other process
associated with it. I finally decided I was tired of learning Linux and
it was time to get my tunes running again, so I rebooted. Lucid
prompted me that Rhythmbox was still running, but I told it to go ahead
and shut down anyway. Then Lucid hung on shutdown and I had to hit the
power button. 

I don't know what kind of code is in Rhythmbox, but it's evil. I've
used it for years without much problem, until now. But I've never been
fond of the interface, so I think I'll shop for alternatives.

   Use ps to get the PID (process identification number). Then type 'kill
<pid>'. If the process is still alive, type 'kill -9 <pid>'. You can also
type 'killall rhythmbox'.

Tried all of those. Repeatedly. Nothing would kill it.

I first noticed the problem because I had shut it down and went to
restart it, but the launcher failed to start it. Of course, it was
still running. In the end I rebooted.

Subject: [PLUG] Rumble grumble
Message-ID: <20120512182010.407b5ba9@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Previously the cables picked up RF in the room giving me odd noise
artifacts. Now that I have my new Bluetooth device set up my stereo is
silent when music is not playing. That is, it is silent except for a
rumble noise in the background. It is loud enough to hear it even
when music is playing. When the music stops it is very obvious, but
then stops and the system goes silent after five or ten seconds.

Since the system goes silent, it cannot be RF interference. 

This happens with Rythmbox, Banshee and Amarok. It happens whether I am
streaming internet radio, playing a CD, or playing an MP3 that I ripped
and encoded from my collection.

I paired it with my Android phone and there is no rumble at all. Music
is clear as a bell.

My guess is that there is something going on with the sound card or the
connection between the sound card and the Bluetooth dongle in the
desktop computer.

Suggestions?

Two more that I didn't see mentioned are:

 a) pidof rhythmbox

    which should return a list (zero or more) of the pid's of process
    named by the argument; and 

 b) pstree -p 

    which lists a nice tree of processes running with parent/child
    links.  The -p option lists the pid's as well.  You can do
    something quite similar with /bin/ps, but I never remember the
    options; pstree is easier to remember.

As for it not dying, i'm not sure.  You could try "strace -p PID",
which should tell you what system calls it is making.  It might not be
making any, which would tell you something (ctrl-c to exit strace).

Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced Topics Meeting Announcement

What: Introduction to Verilog Synthesis
Where: Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue, Conference Room on the left
When: May 15, 2012 at 7pm
Who: Galen Seitz
Why: The pursuit of awesome, open technologies.

(This is an attempt a Google calendar compatibility. Is Why: Supported?)
:-)

This talk will introduce you to the joys and pitfalls of programmable
logic design using Verilog.  The focus will be on small designs that
could conceivably be undertaken by hobbyists.  While we could easily
spend weeks on the subject, we will try to cram the following into an
hour and a half or so:

* Overview of PALs, CPLDs, and FPGAs
* Why use programmable logic
* Verilog constructs for synthesis
* Synthesis workflow
* Simulation
* Guidelines for synthesis
* A demonstration

If your digital logic skills are a bit rusty, you may want to brush up
on your understanding of logic gates and D flip-flops ahead of time.
There are *many* sources of info on the net.  Here are couple that may
be useful:

<http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~jdonalds/210/lecture08.html>
<http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~jdonalds/210/lecture12.html>

Many will break for the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne afterwards.

See you there!

While OSCON as a whole is never free of charge, there are many parts 
that are, notably the Community Leadership Summit:

http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/register/

I see they are now charging $25 (possibly discountable) for the expo hall:

I hope their experimentation with the formula works out for everyone.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu 12.04 requires pae on the CPU?
Message-ID: <4FB1A830.7040206@comcast.net>

So, after burning the right iso, I tried to boot it on my laptop. I get 
the error message:

_________________________________________________________

This kernel requires the following features not present on the CPU: pae

Unable to boot -- please us a kernel appropriate for your CPU.
_________________________________________________________


Sigh. My desktop machine has the feature, but my laptop does not. On my 
desktop machine, I ran:

rsteff at moonguide:~$ grep pae /proc/cpuinfo
flags        : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca 
cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm pbe nx

cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm pbe nx 
constant_tsc pebs bts pni dtes64 monitor ds_cpl cid xtpr
rsteff at moonguide:~$

I tried running the same thing on the laptop and got nothing back.

The desktop CPU is an Intel Pentium 4. The laptop is an Intel Pentium M.

My first bit of Googling showed that there is a way to get 12.04 that 
doesn't need pae, but that defeats the purpose of having both machines 
running close to the same software.

Any thoughts -- other that it's time to replace the laptop? :-(

I assume you're referring to the amd64 version of Ubuntu for the Pentium 
4, and the i386 version for the Pentium M?

Running those respective versions on your machines should still be 
"equivalent" software - you can make sure the same list of packages is 
installed on each machine. Userspace applications can use the same 
configuration files, etc. It's just that the software will have been 
compiled with some different CPU optimizations and the kernels will be 
somewhat different.

If you want absolute binary compatibility between the two machines, you 
could run the i386 version of Ubuntu on both of them. But I'm not so 
sure you really need to do this.

Actually, I hadn't pursued it far enough to figure that out, yet.

I've always taken the default. Would it be different for the two 
versions? How would I know?

That's good. While I always like to go buy new toys -- I mean tools -- a 
new laptop isn't part of the current budget.

That's a thought. I might just try that. Step one is to try it on the 
laptop. If the experience is anything like 11.10 I might be ready to 
change my desktop before Halloween. :-)

Thanks for the comments.

Was "Who" supported? How about "How" for completeness? :) Someone on the 
DorkBot list suggested that it wasn't. Any advice on Description? Please 
send examples of what works.

Thanks and see you there!

No, the Who did not show up in the calendar, but he will probably
show up at the talk tonight.  And no How also is not parsed.

Short answer: No, because of the requirement for "good".  I messed with this
a while back.  After trying a bunch of items that didn't seem to work very
well I landed on the following as "not friendly but the best we've got":

1) To record a video (only) of your screen traffic:

    ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1024x768 -r 10 -i :0.0 -sameq -r 30 ~/output.mpeg

2) To record video and audio (in my case a microphone):

    ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1024x768 -r 30 -i :0.0 -f alsa -ac 2 -i hw:0,0
-sameq -async 4 -map 0,0 -map 1 ~/output.mpeg

All the extra stuff in the "with audio" version is needed to keep the audio
sync'd with the video -- otherwise it drifts progressively farther out of
sync.  You'll probably need to play with some of the parameters to fit your
system (screen resolution, audio source, etc.), but that should get you 80%
of the way there.

Good luck.  If anyone has anything better, let's hear about it!

Hello all,

I've registered for the mailing list after the talk on Tuesday. I am
one of the PSU students who came for the talk.

One of the things I was hoping would be covered in the talk was how to
do FPGA/HDL development with a more unix-like workflow, i.e. without
the crappy IDE.
I was naive to think that there were open-source synthesis tools in
use, in hindsight. The specificity of each vendors chips makes this
very difficult, it seems.

However, it is clear that you could use the xilinx tools without using
the IDE. I searched around after the meeting and found a person's bash
scripts to break this down and use the CLI tools underneath the IDE.

They are here: http://www.edaboard.com/thread217079.html#post925290

I hope that others find this useful in their verilog/HDL experiments.

We just switched to corporate twtelecom service at my office and have
been very pleased with them (over comcast, who was continually unable
and/or unwilling to help us diagnose repeated connectivity issues
which were generally solved by modem reboot).

We've had rock solid service and painstakingly communicative support
from them for the past 2 months, even when we didn't ask for it.  It's
hard to say anything bad about an engineer who calls you every week to
update you on an unchanged status to let you know he's pinged the
relevant 3rd party again in trying to resolve a trouble ticket.  (The
third party, ARIN, finally got back to him and all's well now).

We have an office in a building in which they already had a PoP, so it
was an easy installation process.

I can't help but interject here, that *everybody* should have access
to metro ethernet-like services.  There is no engineering or economic
reason that we can't all have this kind of access for <$50/month.
Cities around the world are implementing this stuff.  It doesn't cost
them the $2k/month that metro ethernet costs here.  The reasons for
this gigantic failure are politically-entrenched interests.  It's
within our collective power to alter that.  I encourage people to let
their remaining mayoral candidates know that this is a topic they want
resolved in their favor.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1205171625140.29696@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   The Sony Vaio was not content to refuse to connect wirelessly using wicd.
Last evening it booted with the ethernet cable connected but did not bring
up eth0. First question I need to answer is what might be responsible for
this behavior when it worked consistently when on the ethernet cable here.

   After poking around I discovered that eth0 was not RUNNING. After issuing
'ifconfig eth0 up' the interface was RUNNING and could ping the server and
gateway/router (the only other hosts up at that time). But, to rub salt in
my wounds, it cannot connect to the 'Net. I see 'network is unreachable'.
When I look at the kernel routing table there is no default route and none
with a 'G' code. I added a default route, but still could not access the
'Net even though I could ping the gateway by name or IP address. What might
be the cause of this? After all it did work until last evening.

   I will try to replace wicd with Network Manager; the applet needs a bunch
to other packages that are not installed by default in Slackware. I will
probably bring the Sony to Sunday's clinic and hope that a networking guru
can provide the necessary expertise and insights that I lack.

Subject: [PLUG] WinTV-PVR-150
Message-ID: <20120517175038.77a5e183@mailhost.pdx.edu>

So a couple days ago I went to the Free Geek Thrift Store to get a
sound card in the hope that it would alleviate the rumble problem I
have with the sound chip on the Asus motherboard. They were out of
stock of sound cards, but right next to the bin where the sound cards
were supposed to be was a Hauppage WinTV-PVR-150 with a $5 price tag.
It says "NTSC/NTSC/3 26552 LF, Rev F0A3."

My desktop computer currently runs Lucid x86_64. All the computer ever
does is stream internet radio and play the occasional movie. But it
might be cool to be able to watch television on it. It is connected to
an Asus 22" monitor at 1920 x 1080. I have Comcast cable with basic TV
service, and an wall jack near the computer.

The computer also has a messed up software RAID (mirror) where one
drive is not running. I haven't bothered to fix it. I set up the mirror
with mdadm when I first built the computer about four years ago just to
figure out how to do it. I have no real need to keep the RAID.

My problem is that I never acquired any clues for television. There are
a ton of formats and many abbreviations of which I have no ken
whatsoever. 

Regardless of my cluelessness, I am thinking I will wipe out Lucid, wipe
out the RAID, and install Mythbuntu 12.04 on one of the two drives,
leaving the other for whatever. Before installing Mythbuntu I will
insert the Hauppage card. My plan is that Mythbuntu will say "Oh gee! A
WinTV-PVR-150!" and proceed to set it up flawlessly. 

Am I dreaming? Has anyone ever used one of these cards?

You will not be able to use the card to view your cable.

About 2 years ago, they moved to a complete digital system that the
old WinTV and Hauppage cards cannot read.

I very likely gave Free Geek that card, I have a very nice expensive 
Hauppage paperweight as well.

If I understand their system correctly, that's mostly true. However, I 
remember something about channels 2-3x (can't remember if it's 31, 32 or 
something else) are still available as analog. So, if John is only 
getting basic cable, it might work.

I do have just basic cable, and have no plans to add more. I suppose I
could just give it a shot and see what happens. I gave Free Geek only
$5 for it, so it's not worth bothering to return. 

Or I could try to figure out what card is guaranteed to work. Maybe
Comcast would know. Nah. I'm still dreaming.

You can use one of the digital converters between your digital signal

conversion took place.  Also, does the comcast set-top box have an
analog tv output to be compatible with older televisions? If so you
could use that.

Subject: [PLUG] Underlying hardware in USB keys vs. CF Cards
Message-ID: <005401cd3549$96004fe0$c200efa0$@MartinConsulting.com>

I'm considering a FreeNAS installation for a client.  FreeNAS is *really*
built around the idea of separating it's software from the data, to the
point that it needs a dedicated "disk" for itself.  The FreeNAS folks were
really thinking of this as being a USB key, since they only need 2G.  I
don't really like the idea of using a USB key for this, because:

1) it sticks out of the machine somewhere where it can get
bumped/broken/etc.  (Yes, I could arrange to have it on an internal or a new
USB add-on card that has an internal slot, but that seems like a bother).
2) I'm generally not thrilled about a production machine's life and death
hanging on the reliability of a USB key.

What I would really like to use is a CD-ROM, but the media needs to be
read-write, so that's out.  There will be a small but steady amount of
writing to the media for logs, temp files, etc., so it's not static by any
means.

I'm considering using an CF card instead of a USB key, but I am wondering if
the underlying hardware is really any different.  Is it just a USB key in a
different package?  Do any of you folks have thoughts about reliability of
these various media choices or others I haven't considered?

As it turns out, Comcast sends an analog signal with channels 2 - 3x (1? 
2?) along with their digital signal. They made a big fuss about having a 
digital only service back a year or two ago when they made their switch. 
But, all they did was make everything above what they now call Limited 
Basic, digital to their set top box. The box I have does not have a 
digital output. I couldn't get the otherwise in store folks in Gladstone 
understand that what's coming out of the RCA jacks  on the back of their 
box is analog. I can feed it into my old VCR and it works. But that's 
yet another issue.

I have the coax coming out of the wall going into a splitter. One half 
goes to the Comcast set top box; the other half to the antenna in on the 
back of my TV. If I switch the TV to its TV input I can step through the 
channels with the TV remote from 2 to 31. I can't get any of the 
channels beyond that without tuning through the Comcast box. The output 
of the Comcast box goes to my ReplayTV 4080. That's too old to deal with 
a digital signal. It's output goes to RCA jacks on the back of the TV. 
My TV has a couple of HDMI jacks, one of which I use with my Blu-ray 
player. That's the only digital TV signal source in the house.

So, if John has a coax from the wall, and if the WinTV-PVR-150 accepts a 
coax in, then it should tune the channels he expects with Basic service.

[rant mode on]
When Comcast switched to so-called Digital service they ruined the 
channel surfing experience. With good old analog I could click the 
remote and another channel would pop up nearly instantaneously. Now, to 
channel surf I have to wait two or three seconds while the set top box 
figures out what I want and puts it up on the screen. So, I haven't 
channel surfed for a couple of years, now. (That's probably just as 
well, but it's annoying that they claimed an improvement but delivered a 
downgrade in order to get it.) Anyway, with the ReplayTV 4080 we rarely 
watch anything live anymore, anyway, so it no longer matters.
[rant mode off]

So, I'd say, go for it, John. And if you get MythTV working, we'd love 
to hear about your experience. If my Replay ever dies I'll probably have 
to build a Myth box, myself.

Have you considered buying an old used smaller internal hard drive and a 
Vantec USB-to-IDE/SATA adapter?  Good used smaller drives are really 
cheap and the Vantec adapter is only a bit over $25. Instead of a USB 
drive sticking out of your machine, all you have is just another USB 
cable connected to the hard drive which you can place anywhere, top of 
the box,  behind/beside it, etc. Plus you can swap out the drive for 
another if it goes belly-up or if you a have a need for another 
USB-linked storage solution without scrubbing out the FreeNAS installation.

Over in OpenWrt land, they make extensive use of overlay filesystems.
Something that would let you run from read-only storage with a tmpfs
or some other mutable storage on top.  Depending on the degree to
which you need those writes stored permenantly, you could move them
off somewhere else.  Or something like that.

pm.

   Regardless, I want to affirm that I'm bringing the Sony Vaio running

networking issues. Wireless has never worked properly (because eth0 is not
taken down when wlan0 is up and running), and this past week eth0 stopped
working.

   I have installed Network Manager (and activated rc.networkmanager during

requires the network-manager-applet and I'll have all the prerequisites
installed for that today.

Subject: [PLUG] Epson ActionLaser 1000 Printer Driver Question
Message-ID: <4FBA8583.7010501@comcast.net>

I'm swapping my network printer for my wife's parallel port printer, 
since she has a new machine with no parallel ports. My problem is one of 
almost enough information plus too much information.

I plugged the Epson ActionLaser 1000 into the parallel port on my Ubuntu 
10.04 machine and clicked on System > Administration > Printing. (I'm 
pretty sure this is CUPS, but couldn't swear to it.) Up pops a little 
window named "Printing - localhost" with an icon for my network printer. 
I clicked on Server > New > Printer. The New Printer window opened with 
LPT #1 selected. I clicked on Forward. It searched for drivers and 
changed the window to say Choose Driver. Options are (*) Select printer 
from database, ( ) Provid PPD file, and ( ) Search for a printer driver 
to download.

Since the first option was marked, I clicked on Forward. The first time 
I did this I got the list of manufacturers, and picked Epson. It 
automagically decided I had an Epson ActionLaser 1100, and gave me three 
drivers, Foomatic something, CUPS Guetenberg light (or something like 
that), and CUPS Gutenberg (something else). The reason I'm vague on 
those things is that I stepped through the process again to copy down 
things into this e-mail as I went. Unfortunately, this time, instead of 
getting the manufacturer's list, I get a list of drivers starting with 
ESC/P Dot Matrix Printer, GDI Printer, IBM-Compatible Dot Matrix 
Printer, OAKT Printer, PCL3 Printer, PCL4 LF Printer, PCL4 Printer ... 
and ending with ZjStream Printer.

The first time through, I was thinking that maybe the 1000 and the 1100 
aren't that far apart, and I should just pick one of the three options. 
Since I think I'm using CUPS, it should be one of those, but would I 
want the light, or the other one?

I tried Googling for a Linux driver for the ActionLaser 1000, but only 
get things for the 1100. There's lots of possibilities. There's the 
ljet3 driver, the gimp-print driver, the gutenprint driver, and the omni 
driver.

Any idea how to simplify my thought process on this so I can pick the 
right driver?

TIA.

   I think that I'm close to resolving the networking issues with the Sony
Vaio. Part of the problem is that Slackware is loading the 2.6.37.6 modules
during boot while the kernel is 3.3.6. I'm in the process of verifying that
I can remove the execute bits for that call since the 3.3.6 modules are
installed with the custom kernel.

   NetworkManager wipes /etc/resolv.conf when the sytem boots. nm-applet does
not appear to offer me options for configuring the interfaces. Please point
me to a resource so I can learn where and how to configure NM so that eth0
has a static IP address and wlan0 gets dynamic IP addresses. Unlike the
debian/ubuntus, slackware does not have /etc/networks/interfaces to edit.

TIA,

You did pretty well so far.  I like to refer to
http://www.openprinting.org/printers - this is the database that the CUPS
tool uses and it's always interesting to see what turns up.

Unfortunately, the ActionLaser 1000 doesn't show up there, so CUPS went
with its fallback plan and offered you a list of generic printer types to
try.  In the FAQ for the printer, Epson says that you should use the "HPLJ2
printer driver" i.e. a HP LaserJet II (or other PCL4) driver.

Good luck,
  Aaron

I'll keep this in mind in case I get some unexplained stuff when I 
print. So far, it looks like the ActionLaser 1100 driver is working okay.

To edit your interface settings from nm-applet, right-click on the
applet icon and select "Edit Connections...".  This will bring up a
window from which you can select your desired interface, then click
"Edit...".  You'll be presented with a configuration window for the
selected interface.

As I recall, NetworkManager will not manage interfaces that are set up
in the traditional manner.  So you might want to make "blank" copies
of your setup files, and let NM do its thing.  Unfortunately, I know
nothing about how Slackware has its config files arranged, so I can't
help there.

Hope this helps.

   I tried that yesterday but nm-applet could find no connections so it
wouldn't let me edit (or add) any.

   It's in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf. I'll make a blank copy and see what
happens.

Thanks, Dale,

   NetworkManager and nm-applet are working just fine for the eth0 interface,
but not yet for the wlan0 interface. When there's no ethernet cable attached
the wifi radio should come on and neighborhood access points become visible.
That's not the case.

   Symptoms:
     - nm-applet will not allow me to enable wireless networking (so it
       can't be configured either).

     - The radio switch is in the 'on' position but the light remains dark.

     - Running 'rfkill list' shows that none of the three wireless lans
       (acer-wireless, sony-wifi, phy0) is hard blocked, but the
       acer-wireless LAN is soft blocked.

   After booting the system I plugged in the ethernet cable and the interface
worked. Then I removed the cable but no wlan0.

   The relevant portions of /var/log/messages is included. I would like a
network maven here to read these chicken entrails for signs of what's not
working properly with the wlan0 interface and why the radio is silent. And,
please suggest what I might do to either resolve this issue or generate
additional useful information.

note that running the scan command from the command line did show wireless

network-manager... we just have to figure out how to tell it that "yes,
there really is a wireless network there for you to manage."

more specifically, we have to figure out the Slackware way of giving
Network Manager this novel bit of information.

Rich, The wireless interface could care less about the status of the wired ethernet. The two are not mutually exclusive, nor dependent on each other. They are two separate network interfaces, with distinct hardware. Quit thinking about the wireless as supposed to do something because the wired does something. That's not how it's supposed to work.

You could have one, both or none of the ethernet interfaces running, and the system should be just fine with any of those cases. 

In fact, I would probably be diagnosing this issue with the wired ethernet running, so that I have access to network resources while I'm trying to bring up the wireless.

a process that is "unkillable" is stuck in the kernel usually because of
some i/o problem.  strace won't work because the process is already in
kernel mode.  given that it was a music program, i'd guess that
something in the audio drivers has a bug that got tripped over and was
stuck waiting for something to happen with no timeout.

Wes,

   OK. I think of the rfkill list results as wireless connections and you
refer to them as networks. Now I'm with you. I was hoping there'd be a hard
lock that could then be removed to fix the problem.

   Regardless of distribution, what is the novel bit of information that
needs to be given to NM? I did not see anything in the message log that
looked like a blockage or failure, but I'm not a professional, full-time,
experienced linux admin.

   Are there other logs to be examined (dmesg had nothing interesting)? What
about other diagnostics similar to 'rfkill list?'

Thanks,

Rich

Russell,

   I did this yesterday. It would be helpful to know what resources to
explore (i.e., what Google search terms to use) and how to further diagnose
the cause of the wifi radio and wlan0 not becoming active.

   Searching for '+NetworkManager +rfkill' finds folks running various
distributions which turn out to be hard blocks in place. That's not the case
here. I don't know enough to ask an intelligent, productive question of the
Web.

   Can you suggest tests or additional information that would help identify
the source of the problem?

Thanks,

Rich

rfkill list is not the scanning command I was referring to. I forget what
it was.. I discovered it while working on this issue on your laptop on
sunday. you might be able to find it by opening a terminal and pressing
ctrl+r, then something like scan or list. ctrl+r more times to go farther
back.

the novel info is "there is a wireless interface for you to manage." in
other distros, this is done with something like a sysconfig or
system-config-network style of tool. I found this while googling related to
this issue.

I am, and it is for this reason that I have developed a fervent hatred of
anything I can't peek inside. wireless ethernet is the worst. maybe
bluetooth could be worse.

I looked all the places I can think of. this issue appears to be specific
to the way Network Manager interacts with Slackware... I can only imagine
that enabling some sort of debug output or logging system within NM could
yield a clue. this is the path I would have gone next if we had more time.

Wes,

   'iwlist scanning' only works when the radio (and wlan0) is up. It returns
a list of available access points with the relative signal strengh of each.
On the Sony it's not now available.

   I'll ask more experienced slackers about this.

Thanks for the pointers,

I would expect to see 1 entry for bluetooth and 1 entry for wifi.

Mike,

   lspci identifies the radio chip; what tells me the appropriate driver? I
can check with lsmod to see what's loaded but that does not tell me what's
missing.

   Shrug. I was surprised to see acer-wireless along with sony-wifi on a Sony
laptop. No idea what 'phy0' is, either.

wes,

   No. NM is supposed to do this, right?

   BTW, the driver is 'iwlwifi' and it's loaded in the kernel and available
for use.

   'lspci | grep -i wireless' shows me the chip and it's device number.

   'lspci -vv -s <device number at the beginning of the line produced by the
above>' shows the necessary driver (iwlwifi) and informs me that it's loaded
in the kernel.

yes, that's the point - we need to find the slackware way to tell NM to do
this.

the point of doing it other ways (ifconfig, iwlist) is to demonstrate that
it's an issue specific to NM, not the driver or kernel or anything else.

If memory serves from when Rich and I worked on this issue together, he was
having the same problem
using WICD and we decided to install NM for some comparison testing.

Based on the testing Rich and I did, I don't think the problem is specific
to NM. With WICD, the
wifi interface would come up and radio connection would be made. But then
there was IP routing troubles as Rich couldn't get to the wifi captive
portal page. When I ran a traceroute, I saw the packets attempting to go
out the eth0 interface that has a static ip but no cable plugged in.

this makes me feel that the current issue is specific to NM. I wish I could
have had a turn at the wheel with wicd; what you describe sounds much more
within my field to handle.

Dear Pluggers,

As many of you know, I'm a contract system administrator.  I don't generally
take on full time contracts (e.g. 40+ hours per week) in order to have time
available to support my existing client base, though I will for short
projects like DR tests or production cutovers.

I'm looking to meet other folks in the Portland OR area that are doing the
same thing, particularly with Linux or Unix skills.  Please contact me
off-list if you're such an individual, or if you know of someone you can
point me towards.

Rich, I have had the same type of problem on my laptop. I am not sure why
it works, but have you tried the function keys on the laptop for
enabling/disabling the wireless card? I cannot get NM to bring up the
wireless card if it has been disabled via the function keys, even across
reboots. Once enabled via the function keys, NM works normally and can
enable/disable it as you would expect.

Jason

Rich, at this point I would highly recommend you go back to the default
vanilla Slackware install with WICD. The remove the static ip conifg on
eth0 and see if WICD manages the interface and routes packets correctly to
the WAP. I suspect it will. I can't recall if we did this test.

Based on my experience with this issue, my definition of the problem is
this:

When there is a static ip config for eth0 and no cable is plugged into
eth0, the default gateway entry for eth0 is not removed and causes problems
routing packets over the WLAN.

 However, this should work. On the Dell, there are two default routes in
the routing table. 1 for eth0 and 1 for wlan0. I believe on the Dell there
were different metrics when the "route -n" command was run. Which I would
expect there to be if on default gwy interface has an active connection and
the other doesn't.

   Just did. Makes no difference in the wlan0 interface.

wes,

   OK, here're the results: 'ifconfig wlan0' shows it's neither UP nor
RUNNING.

   'ifconfig wlan0 up' brings it UP: the radio light on the front edge turns
on. Still not RUNNING.

   'iwconfig wlan0' shows how the interface is configured.

   'iwlist scan' produces a list of neighborhood WAPs. 'ifconfig wlan0' shows
it's still not RUNNING, but it's UP.

   This was the same situation with wicd running instead of NM. WICD has
nothing to do with eth0, only wireless interfaces. It works on my Dell
running Slackware-13.37/x86_64, on the Toshiba running Xubuntu-11.10 (which
won't work on eth0, strangely enough), and on previous portables I've had.

   So, since wlan0 can be brought UP manually, can we assume it's a NM issue
and not a hardware issue?

Thanks,

Rich

Mike,

   It's still a vanilla installation; wicd is an optional package that comes
in the /extra filesystem.

   That does not seem to be the case with NM. There's no ethernet cable
attached and both eth0 and wlan0 are UP, but neither is RUNNING. 'iwlist
scan' shows the closeby WAPs.

   Well, 'route -n' (and plain 'route') show only 127.0.0.1 (localhost) in
the kernel routing table.

   Ergo, there is no default route for wlan0 and no gateway specified.
HOWEVER, ... when I plug in the Ethernet cable, route shows a default to
router1.appl-ecosys.com and a broadcast to 192.168.55.0; the default flag is
'UG'. I can ping another LAN host and the 'Net. Radio light's still on.

   So, it seems to be an issue of no route being set for the wlan0 interface
with either WICD or NM. What does this suggest as the cause? Again, it seems
to me to be something about the Sony Vaio since the Dell is running the same
distribution and version (with WICD) and works flawlessly.

Sigh,

Rich

Ok. Now the next step is to connect to one of those nearby WAPs, and see if negotiation happens.

Russell,

   They're all encrypted. I'll take the Sony to a local coffee shop later
this afternoon and see what it does.

=> WICD is akin to NM. It provides a GUI interface for the management of
network interfaces. Be they wired or wireless.

=> I don't think it's safe to make that assumption at this point honestly
because I think you're too far past a default/vanilla install. Too many
variables to isolate the issue to NM, in my mind.

=> Rich, where is the static ip configuration on the Sony? Is it in a
networking file such as rc.inet? The reason I ask is because there's a WICD
wired network settings config file in which the static ip config can be
set. http://www.linuxcertif.com/man/5/wicd-wired-settings.conf/. This way
WICD has full control and awareness of all the network settings and can
manage them accordingly.

My gut tells me the problem is the interaction between the slackware
network config/init scripts and the network management application. Be it
WICD or NM.

   In NM via the nm-applet. That works.

   Your gut may be correct. I suspect the hardware because I've used WICD on
a different Sony Vaio and two different Toshiba models. Also with different
Slackware versions.

   I'll go to ENU and buy a USB radio and see what that does; they might even
let me try it out there first.

How could this be  a hardware problem? You did a scan and saw access

   I just remembered, too, that when I bought the Sony a few months ago I
installed Xubuntu-11.10 on it. When the wireless networking didn't work I
replaced that distribution with Slackware.

   So, two distributions, two wireless network managers, ... no wlan0
working.

Never the less, the hardware is working. It didn't just guess which access
points were in the neighborhood.
New hardware might work because it bypasses some hidden configuration
snafu, but it's no guarantee.

When we tested at the coffee shop in Gresham, wlan0 was getting an ip addr.
So the hardware is fine. But there is some sort of software or interplay of
software problem as I suggested. Can you connect to an "open" WAP and get
out to the internet? The reason you couldn't get to the internet from the
coffee shop is because you couldn't connect to the wifi captive portal page
to accept the T&C page because there  was a routing conflict between eth0
and wlan0.

We need to isolate and test basic wifi functionality. Until you do this, we
won't know what truly works and what doesn't.

Step 1. Remove the static ip config for eth0
Step 2: Test wifi connectivity and WLAN access to an WAP w/o a t&c captive
portal toi the internet via command line. This removes any software issues
with network management apps. If fact, you can do wireless config setup and
wired setup in rc.inet1.conf.

Bill,

   Yes. The same Xubuntu-11.10 that was originally installed. And, I just
tried it again. The radio light did not come on and 'sudo ifconfig -a'
showed wlan0 down.

Bill,

   I agree that it's not the hardware; the USB radio gets returned tomorrow.

   This is quite frustrating: two distributions, two network managers, the
Intel radio chip driver is loaded in the kernel, but wlan0 will just not
automatically come UP and it does not start RUNNING and establish routes in
the kernel routing table.

Thanks,

Rich

Mike,

   Tomorrow ... or in a couple of days. I've an auto accident to deal with
now as well as my own work.

   With NM there is no eth0 in the routing table when there's no cable
connected so that should not be an issue.

> Step 1. Remove the static ip config for eth0

   That was done within Slackware; it's in nm-applet and does not appear in
the routing table when there's no cable connected.

   Yep. Read Eric's stuff.

So, maybe the wireless does not come on by default. Did you go to Network
Manager and turn on wireless?
I don't know about Xubuntu livecds, but maybe this will help

Bill,

   I've tried, but the 'enable wireless' is greyed out and won't respond
until the interface is UP and RUNNING.

   All fixed.

   My business partner (a professional software engineer) came over and
eventually discovered that a) not all pre-requisites for nm-applet were
installed despite my getting all that were offered to me and 2) wicd works
when the configuration for wlan0 is entered in rc.inet1.conf.

   Because no other portable of mine has wanted wlan0 configuration in the
file -- only the static IP info for eth0 -- it never occurred to me to put
in anything for wlan0. He, being naive about my experiences with wireless
connectivity on my laptops, decided that that would be good information to
provide to the system. He was correct.

   Thanks to everyone who helped both directly and via this mail list!

   When the system boots wicd calls dhcpcd and it looks for a lease. Not
finding any because the ethernet cable's plugged in, the system continues
booting.

   For a reason yet to be discovered ... Real Soon Now ... while eth0 is UP
and RUNNING with a broadcast route for the LAN, there's no default route
with a gateway IP address. I put that in rc.inet1.conf in the eth[0] section
but without effect. So, ... as a kludge at the end of rc.local I put 'route
add default gw 192.168.55.4' and now eth0 works, too! Hoo-ha! This is a poor
substitute for a real fix, but it lets me turn the laptop over to its
intended user and quit futzing with it.

   Many thanks again to Wes, Mike, and everyone else offering expertise in
networking and the reading of chicken entrails. I really appreciate all of
you.

Here's some followup info regarding my recent AT verilog talk.  Sorry
for the delay.  I hope someone finds it useful.  Michael, please feel
free to forward this as needed.

Thanks to everyone for showing up and asking great questions.  If you
have further questions, you can send them directly to me.
Alternatively, you could use plug-talk, as I'm a subscriber there.
I'm guessing the main list has less interest in verilog discussions.

Here's the source code for verilog demo.  I fixed the bug in the
counter.  My attempt to generate a synchronous carry chain wasn't
appropriate in this situation.  Once I fixed the carry chain, the
counter worked as intended.  I also cleaned up the resets, added
switch debouncing, added a finite state machine that implements a
simple stopwatch, and fixed the testbench.
<http://www.aracnet.com/~galens/verilog/verilog_demo.tgz>

Here's the development board I used for the demo.  I added 3 L293D
buffers external to the board to boost the LED drive.
<http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,398,427&Prod=XC2XL>

Here's a link to the Cliff Cummings papers I mentioned.
<http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/>

In particular, I've found these papers useful:
1. Coding And Scripting Techniques For FSM Designs With
Synthesis-Optimized, Glitch-Free Outputs
2. Nonblocking Assignments in Verilog Synthesis, Coding Styles That Kill!
3. "full_case parallel_case", the Evil Twins of Verilog Synthesis
4. Verilog Nonblocking Assignments With Delays, Myths & Mysteries


The verilog information found at this site seems to be of relatively
high quality.
<http://www.asic-world.com/verilog/>


FWIW, I've yet to see a verilog book that I've thought was worth the
expense.  I wish Cliff would write one, as I think he would do a very
good job.


Finally, here's a few random verilog tips.  You'll probably come
across various forms of these if you do any verilog reading on the net.

1. Limit modules to one per file.
2. Don't try to create tri-states internal to your FPGA/CPLD.
3. Synchronize asynchronous inputs with two flip-flops to avoid
metastable states.
4. Avoid synthesizing latches.  If the synthesis tools warns you about
latches, pay attention.
5. Using the verilog reg type doesn't necessarily mean the synthesis
tool will generate a register.  reg is used for combinatorial logic too.
6. From a timing and verification standpoint, it's often a good idea
to register the outputs of a module.

Inline awk scripts need to be single quoted and there needs to be a semi-colon
between statements on the same line like:
awk 'BEGIN{ FS="|";OFS="|";} .....' file

   True. But this is not a single line script on the command line; it's in a
script fed to awk.

   OK. A semi-colon between the FS and OFS statements fixed the error.

Thanks, Larry,

Rich,

The page, http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html,  shows an 
example of two variables supplied in a "BEGIN" statement:

   $awk 'BEGIN { OFS = ";"; ORS = "\n\n" }


Looks like a semicolon is the separator here.

   I obviously do not grok the use of OFS (Output Field Separator) and how to
specify its use in a print statement. Here's my complete script:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#! /usr/bin/awk -f

# add-non-detect.awk -- Add both an indicator digit (0 = quantified, 1 = <RL) 
#                       and bounds to non-detected quantities.
# Fields: site, sampdate, param, quant; last char is \n.

BEGIN { FS = "|"; OFS = "|" }

# Detected quantity
$4 !~ /-.*/ { print $1 $2 $3 $4 "0" $4 $4 }

# Non-detected quantity

$4 ~ /-.*/ { print $1 $2 $3 $4 "1" "0" $4 }

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And here are three lines of data:

'D-1'|'2007-12-12'|'Ag'|0.000|
'D-1'|'2007-12-12'|'Al'|0.106|
'D-1'|'2007-12-12'|'CO3'|-1.000|

   The output from the script is:

'D-1''2007-12-12''Ag'0.00000.0000.000
'D-1''2007-12-12''Al'0.10600.1060.106
'D-1''2007-12-12''CO3'-1.00010-1.000

   Not only are the pipe symbols missing, but I see the logic needs
correcting, too. I'll work on that after I learn how to properly specify OFS
and the print statements.

   Now I do. There's no field separator if there is no comma between the
field specifiers. Adding those cured this issue. Now to fix the logic ...

You would only need the OFS if it was different from the FS like this simple
example:
[lbrigman-lbrigman_tot_area51 at lbrigman-desktop kernel]$ awk 'BEGIN{
FS=":";OFS="|";} {print $1,$NF}' /etc/passwd | head -10
root|/bin/bash
bin|/sbin/nologin
daemon|/sbin/nologin
adm|/sbin/nologin
lp|/sbin/nologin
sync|/bin/sync
shutdown|/sbin/shutdown
halt|/sbin/halt
mail|/sbin/nologin
news|

Note the print field,field.  The comma is replaced by the OFS.

   The Web site with the 32-bit compatibility libraries for Slackware64 has
several directories each containing numerous files with different
extensions. I want to recursively download all those with the extension of
t?z.

   ncftpget won't accept an http:// URL and wget -r gets all files in every
subdirectory, including those I don't need, but won't accept wildcards
(e.g., *.txz)

   Is there another tool (or option for the above) that will do the job?

   Update: my script needs both or the output has a space for a separator
rather than a pipe. So be it.

Michael,

   This looks to me like post-download processing after the entire site is
copied here. I suppose then there's no way of limiting the download to
specified files.

my man page has a whole chapter titled "Recursive Accept/Reject Options."
however, I would just copy the whole site as Michael suggested until I was
sure my end goal had been accomplished.

Wes, Bill, Michael:

   Looking again in the man page I tried to get the files I need, but
encounter an error. The URL for the directory (and its subdirectories) is:
              http://connie.slackware.com/~alien/multilib/13.37/

   The command I tried, and the result is:

[rshepard at salmo /opt]$ wget -r -A t?z -nH --cut-dirs=1 http://connie.slackware.com/~alien/multilib/13.37/

Cannot write to ?multilib/13.37/index.html? (No such file or directory).

   I chose these options for recursive (-r), accept only files ending in t?z
(-A t?z), and remove the parent directories when writing to the local disk
(-nH --cut-dirs=1). Obviously, I don't properly specify the options.

   Please tell me what that command line should be to get only the *.t?z
files in the ../13.37/ directory and the compat32/ subdirectory.

Thanks,

Rich

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1205251030340.28833@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've looked in the ORA book and on line without seeing what I've written
incorrectly in this script:

#! /usr/bin/awk -f

BEGIN { FS = OFS = "|"}

if ($3 ~ /Ag/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-0.005" };
else if ($3 ~ /Alk_tot/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-1.000" };
else if ($3 ~ /Cr/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-0.030" };
else if ($3 ~ /Fe/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-1.200" };
else if ($3 ~ /Mg/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-1.000" };
else if ($3 ~ /NO3-NO2/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2. $3, "-0.020" };
else if ($3 ~ /Na/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-0.530" };
else if ($3 ~ /Sb/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-0.010" };
else if ($3 ~ /Se/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-0.003" };
else if ($3 ~ /TDS/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-15.000" };
else { print $1, $2, $3, $4 }

   awk tells me there's a syntax error at the start of each 'if' and 'else
if' line. I've seen examples without the semi-colon and with it, but I've
not found what I'm doing incorrectly. I also tried wrapping the body of the
script in {} but that makes no difference, either.

   A clue is needed.

Rich,

I would  suspect your error is really in the previous statement.

BEGIN { FS = OFS = "|" }

I would restate this as:

BEGIN { FS = "|"; OFS = "|" }

First, from the wget man page:

   -A acclist --accept acclist
   -R rejlist --reject rejlist
      Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or patterns to 
accept or reject. Note that if any of the wildcard
      characters, *, ?, [ or ], appear in an element of acclist or 
rejlist, it will be treated as a pattern, rather than a suffix.

Since you use t?z your acclist will match any file with 
t<anycharacter>z in the name.
This matches 36 files in the directory you're searching.  These include 
*txz.asc *txz.md5 *txz and *tgz

 From your description of what you wish to do this is not the file list 
you're trying to match.

Scanning the directory listing it seems you only want *tgz and *txz 
files.

Ken,

   That's the way I had it, but I saw an example using the first syntax and
thought it would also work. But, ... I just changed it back and still get
the same syntax error.

   Every syntax example I find on the Web and in the ORA book I've tried; all
without success. It's such a simple thing I wonder why it's so difficult to
see.

Thanks,

Rich

All those semicolons ... ??? ... I don't think that is supported inside 
a script.

I think your problem lies at the end of each if  or else if statement
as you have
a semi-colon which terminates the operation.  You can move the semi-colon
to inside the } or remove it altogether.

Michael,

   Yes. Changing the option to -A tgz, txz makes no difference.

Fred,

   Same errors without them. The awk manual and a couple of other pages note
that without the semi-colons in the if ... else if ... else sequence awk
doesn't know how to process the commands. The ORA book does not show them.

Thanks,

Rich

awk: ./zero-to-rl.awk:17: else if ($3 ~ /Se/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1,
$2, $3, "-0.003" }
awk: ./zero-to-rl.awk:17: ^ syntax error
awk: ./zero-to-rl.awk:18: else if ($3 ~ /TDS/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1,
$2, $3, "-15.000" }
awk: ./zero-to-rl.awk:18: ^ syntax error
awk: ./zero-to-rl.awk:19: else { print $1, $2, $3, $4 }
awk: ./zero-to-rl.awk:19: ^ syntax error

   No semi-colons at the end, same syntax error indication.

   Putting semi-colons inside the closing brace still yields the same syntax
error indication.

Thanks,

Never mind.
You are trying to parse on fields when the fields have not been parsed yet.
add {
} around your whole conditional list like:
 {if ....... else ...... }
and move your semi-colons inside the { } for the conditions action.

Here is the code that executes (or at least doesn't throw syntax errors.
---------------------------
#! /usr/bin/awk -f

BEGIN { FS = OFS = "|"}

{ if ($3 ~ /Ag/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-0.005"; }
else if ($3 ~ /Alk_tot/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-1.000"; }
else if ($3 ~ /Cr/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-0.030"; }
else if ($3 ~ /Fe/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-1.200" ;}
else if ($3 ~ /Mg/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-1.000" ;}
else if ($3 ~ /NO3-NO2/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2. $3, "-0.020" ;}
else if ($3 ~ /Na/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-0.530" ;}
else if ($3 ~ /Sb/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-0.010" ;}
else if ($3 ~ /Se/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-0.003" ;}
else if ($3 ~ /TDS/ && $4 ~ /0.000/) { print $1, $2, $3, "-15.000" ;}
else { print $1, $2, $3, $4 }
}

The asterisk is critical.  -A "*tgz,*txz"

Should the print be something more like:
   

else { print ($1, $2, $3, $4) }

??

Larry,

   Here's a sample:

   Aha! I tried those one at a time, but not both together. Individually,
they did nothing; together they taught me how to do this.

   None of the examples I examined had both brackets around the if ... else
if ... else range and semi-colons. Or, I just didn't see it all despite how
closely I examined the code.

Thanks, Larry!

Fred,

   Probably wouldn't hurt, but not necessary.

   C and Python are so much more block structured than is awk that it's
taking me a while to learn just how to write more complex scripts.

Now that I had some sample code there are a couple of other things here.
The resulting output file won't have the trailing | character.
Your filters will also output blank lines with | characters.

Here is the resulting file output from your sample data using the
corrected filter:
--------------------------------
'A'|'1987-12-12'|'Ag'|-0.005
'A'|'1987-12-12'|'Al'|0.106
'A'|'1987-12-12'|'CO3'|-1.000
'A'|'1987-12-12'|'HCO3'|231.000
'A'|'1987-12-12'|'Alk_tot'|231.000
'A'|'1987-12-12'|'As'|0.011
'A'|'1987-12-12'|'Ba'|0.000
'A'|'1987-12-12'|'Be'|-0.002
'A'|'1987-12-12'|'Bi'|0.000
'A'|'1987-12-12'|'Ca'|100.000
'A'|'1987-12-12'|'Cd'|0.000
'A'|'1987-12-12'|'Cl'|1.430

'A'|'1987-12-12'|'Cr'|-0.006
'A'|'1987-12-12'|'Cu'|0.024
-------------------------------------
Only the first line had data changed from 0.000 to -0.005.

Larry,

   The output from this script could have the final '|' or I add that in
emacs before running the output through a different awk script that codes
each row depending on whether the last value is negative.

   Now why is that? There must be a logic flaw in the script. _Every_ 'Ag'
was changed, but none of the other chemicals showing 0.000.

Well none of the other chemicals had a filter match with a value of 0.000.
The only match from the filter for chemical was Cr but it had a -0.006
Ba,Bi and Cd had 0.000 but nothing was in the filter for them.
I added two valued to the table to check that it work and they matched
and changed the values.

   Ah, so! I ran a database query for those with negative numbers, but forgot
to do the same for those with zeros. That certainly explains it!

   Another case of seeing what I expect to see rather than what's there, and
fresh eyes easily see just what's there (or missing, in this case).

Thanks,

Rich

   I found those with a stated reporting level but not those without that
level. Plenty of zeros in the latter category.

Thanks for the lessons,

Subject: [PLUG] Preferred VM on Mac for Linux
Message-ID: <1338228322.3560.87.camel@kauai>

Folks, 

I may be getting a Mac soon, and am wondering about virtualization
options to accommodate Linux. The two basic options I know of are VMWare
Fusion 4 and Parallels Desktop 7.

Based on this wikipedia article,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_VMware_Fusion_and_Parallels_Desktop The differences seem trivial, since graphics quality is not important to me. But the article preface suggests that the info may be out of date. 

What do people here prefer -- and if there's background info on why, I'd
appreciate it! (Right now, I'm leaning towards VMWare Fusion, simply due
to price.)

Thanks,
Mike

i use virtualbox daily on a macbook air, to run several flavors of
linux and one flavor of windows.  it's free and has stellar
command-line tools and full support of the mac hardware and my linuces
and windows run great.

just to throw another option in there.  many of my co-workers use
vmware instead, but i've been a longtime fan of virtualbox and i get
the same work done without any extra hassle.

I've never tried Parallels.

I tried VirtualBox a while back, but a bug in the hostfs was causing real 
problems for me (using '*' in a directory access returned an error, like 
"rm *.o"). Supposedly that bug's been fixed, but I've never felt like spending 
the time setting it up and installing an OS just to test it.

I've been using VMWare Fusion ever since. I have it on both my work laptop 
and my personal system, with both Linux and Windows7 in both places.

In my work environment I have to access development hardware via USB from both 
guest Oses, and have never had an issue in either virtual system.

Fusion 'just works', and I never think about it.

I heard a talk by Greg K-H a month or so ago that said that some
processes run faster IN A VM on a linux guest than they do natively on
a Mac.  I don't remember the details, but it was an amusing anecdote.

IIRC, the claim was embedded somewhere in this interview:

As pointed out in a comment for the last link, there is lots of (intentional) caching going on within Fusion.  Any tests for this kind of thing would need to either first disable caching, or read/write enough that it forces the system to go beyond the caching in place.  W/o that, the tests are meaningless.

That said, HFS has been pushed to the limits of what it can reasonably do, and there are far better filesystems out there.

Not quite meaningless.  If you want caching, I guess you want to run
in a linux VM. ;-)

It's hard to avoid calling it embarrassing that a VM you host runs
something faster than you can run the same thing natively.  It almost
defies the laws of thermodynamics! ;-)

Anyway, someone asked for an example of why you might want to run a
linux VM under OSX.  That, apparently, is one.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Meeting Announcement

Who: Lance Albertson
What: The Ganeti Virtualization Management System
Where: PSU, 1930 SW 4th Ave. Room FAB 86-01 (Lower Level)
When: Thursday, June 7th, 2012 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of awesome, open technologies.

See location H-10 on the PSU map at http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg

Ganeti is a robust cluster virtualization management software tool. It?s 
built on top of existing virtualization technologies such as Xen and KVM 
and other Open Source software. Its integration with various 
technologies such as DRBD and LVM results in a cheaper High Availability 
infrastructure and linear scaling.

This hands-on tutorial will cover a basic overview of Ganeti, the 
step-by-step install & setup of a single-node and multi-node Ganeti 
cluster, operating the cluster, and some best practices of Ganeti. 
Finally, deploying and using a web-based management tool called Ganeti 
Web Manager.

Lance is the Associate Director of Operations for the Oregon State 
University Open Source Lab (OSL) and a Gentoo Linux Developer. He joined 
the Gentoo Linux project in 2003 and have been involved in managing 
their infrastructure and maintaining about a dozen or so packages in 
portage. Lance directs all of the hosting and development activities 
that the OSL provides for the open source community including projects 
such as Kernel.org, Drupal, Apache Software Foundation, and many many 
more. Lance has been at the OSL since 2007.

Subject: [PLUG] Plug meeting - counterfeit toner
Message-ID: <20120530163455.GA12908@gate.kl-ic.com>

Either before the Plug general meeting or at afters, I would
like to pass around two HP Q6000A toner cartridges (in boxes),
one (apparently) genuine and one almost-accurate Hong Kong
knockoff - advertised as genuine on eBay.  Besides bad
feedback (which will may cause retaliation feedback), there
is no obvious way to contact eBay to tell them this 3000+
seller is peddling counterfeit goods.

The differences are subtle - the boxes are printed almost
identically, with some kerning and quality differences.
The hologram is not quite as good.  The pullstrip does not 
have an orange finger ring.  The printed HP toner is shiny
at an oblique angle - the knockoff is matte.   I've got one
of the knockoffs in a spare printer, I will see if it leaks
or not - leakage can severely cripple the HP260x printers.

I know ways to design a knockoff-proof cartridge, but it 
would be better if China produced their own printers with
them, enforced their own knockoff protection, and sold those
cheaper than HP's printers.  Trying to sustain a market 
advantage by subsidizing printers with overpriced cartridges
is unnatural, and will eventually drive HP out of the
printer market.  Build loyalty, not tricks.  

One way is to bundle warranty and phone support with the
toners - keep buying toners, keep extending the warranty. 
If the printers can self-maintain over the internet, with
the toners providing the access keys and phone numbers,
then a premium price for toners will buy something of value.

Why is this a Linux topic?  Because perhaps the new Chinese
printers can run Linux, and will be field upgradable to
better firmware - like Linux.  One way to attract customers
is to offer products that can be improved over time, perhaps
customized to individual needs.  One way to make sure the
printers only report status information and not secret 
company documents is to make the firmware readable.  That
has Linux written all over it.

With the help of sh, cut and ImageMagic, I finally have a primitive but 
serviceable gallery of my OSCON 2012 photos up:

http://callfortesting.org/oscon2011/

I'd love to talk to any ImageMagick-aholics out there about how to do a 
few things better.

Also note that the deadline for nominating someone for the 2012 OSCON 
2012 Open Source Awards is June 21st:

Hello all,

If you want to participate on the hands-on portion of Lance Albertson's 
Ganeti talk next week, feel free to clone his vagrant-ganeti repo on 
github (https://github.com/ramereth/vagrant-ganeti) prior to the 
meeting. He plans to have the box images available on USB drives at the 
meeting if you can't do this in advance.

Hello all,

Might anyone have a spare Verizon feature (dumb/non-smart phone) that 
they don't need anymore? A headset and decent battery life are plusses.

Even a pink RAZR would do. :)

Thanks! See you next Thursday.

I have a dark blue Razr V3, but it was originally AT&T. I unlocked it
to use it on T-Mobile, but I don't think it will work on Verizon. It's
yours if you can use it.
