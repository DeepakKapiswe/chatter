Subject: [PLUG] Booting from CD-ROM/USB with old BIOS
Message-ID: <41f575d10601010437h18e2e7d7k7f0a5c811171e0f6@mail.gmail.com>

Happy new year everyone!

I have a few older systems around, which predate the El Torito and USB
booting standards. A while back I found a really cool boot disk which is
basically a bootloader - it just presents a menu of all logical devices on
the system (including CD-ROMs) and allows you to boot from any of them, even
on systems whos BIOSes don't support CD-ROM booting.

Having recently lost my bookmarks, I've been unable to find again the
program which creates the disk again. I've also misplaced the disk :( I've
been googling for almost an hour now - I can't remember the name of the
product. All I remember is that to create the floppy I had to be in windows,
and run the program with a single commandline argument of '0' to specify the
first removable disk drive as the target.

I was thinking it was hosted at sourceforge (I believe it was opensource)
but I looked through all the projects at sourceforge with the word 'boot' in
them. Does anyone know the name of the product I'm talking about? If not,
something I could use instead to accomplish the same thing?

Thanks in advance!

You are talking about the smart boot manager. I usually grab it from a
Debian mirror (since it's on all their CDs), but it has a page at
http://btmgr.webframe.org/

Thanks! I do believe that's what I was looking for. I thought it had USB
boot support also, though. Is there something out there that will let you
boot from a USB CD-ROM or HDD?

I have a laptop with no CD-ROM and the PCMCIA drive is failing.

Thanks,
Aaron

Subject: [PLUG] Chroot
Message-ID: <43B7F164.29499.23C3F9C0@localhost>

OK, I finally decided to brave the chroot waters. My goal was (is) to 
install Acrobat Reader 7.0 on my Ubuntu-64 Breezy laptop. I found 
instructions for installing chroot at:
http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/installation/chroot32bits
Amazingly, I managed to get all the way through it without errors. I 
now have a /chroot directory. I managed to get Syanptic32 loaded 
and, lo and behold, Acrobat Reader 7.0 was listed. (It is not listed 
in 64-bit Synaptic.) 

I installed it and everything seemed to go OK. But at the very end 
of the instructions they explained how to use Synaptic32 to install 
applications. They used Flash as the example. Well, when it 
comes to French I suck. I just couldn't quite figure out the last part; 
that is, I think I have Acrobat Reader 7.0 installed in chroot, but I 
can't figure out how to launch it. Something about links that I don't 
get.

Another curiousity -- I can't find the executable file under chroot. 
The only files labeled "acroread" are a shell script and an 
executable, bot of which were installed previously when I was trying 
to install Acrobat Reader before installing chroot. I have no idea 
where Synaptic32 put the files. Or did it just link to the original 
ones? Or what?

In any event, typing "acroread" does nothing. I just get "command 
not found." Doing it as sudo has the same effect. Double-clicking 
on the script or on the executable also does nothing.

I'm sure there is a trick to this that a n00bie like me hasn't figured 
out yet.

   I've used gnucash for several years and I really like the pragmatic
interface without useless eye candy. Unfortunately, it no longer runs with
Slackware-10.2. I spent more than 5 hours yesterday trying to resolve the
gnome dependencies, but gave up when it wanted a different version of glib.

   The fellow who packaged gnucash-1.8.11 for Slackware-10.1 wrote back to me
that he, too, has given up trying to get the latest gnucash to work with the
latest Slackware. He's moved to KMyMoney (Gack! Horrible name!). Is anyone
here using it? Apparently, it will import the gnucash data files so that's a
point in its favor. Will I get into a KDE dependency hell trying to get this
up and running?

   How about QHacc ... anyone here using that? It, like KMyMoney, uses the Qt
library and is loaded with functionless eye candy of icons just because it
can be done with that widget collection.

   Are there other options for double-entry personal bookkeeping? A ncurses
interface would satisfy me, too.

TIA,

Rich

Rich,

We had similar problems with a few applications at work.  We used a
workaround.  LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.

This allowed the compat libraries to work, I think.  I believe you are
fighting the 2.4/2.6 change.

Ken,
CAD 2 CAM

Ken,

   This box is running the 2.4.31 kernel. No, it's the extensive Gnome
dependencies that gnucash wants that drove me away. Sigh.

Thanks,

I used it when I had 64-bit Ubuntu Hoary. But when I upgraded to 
Breezy it broke. Dependency issues.

But this thread reminded me that I've been meaning to try again. 
(It's been a couple months since I balanced things.) So I went into 
Synaptic and reinstalled it. Sure enough, dependencies broken. 
Unfortunately, I cannot remember what the error messages said, 
but I know that it referred to a specific library and that a different 
library was expected.

So I went into Synaptic and noted that the offending library was 
installed, and the other one was not installed. I installed the other 
one, but GnuCash still wouldn't start. 

So then I uninstalled GnuCash completely, and then looked again 
at the libraries. The offending library was not only no longer 
installed, it wasn't even listed in Synaptic. So, acting on a hunch, I 
installed the "expected" one. And then I reinstalled GnuCash. And, 
wonder of wonders, it is working fine. No errors at all. And upon 
reinstallation it did not install the offending library. I am assuming 
the offending library is one that it installs if it can't find the 
"expected" one.

Wish I could remember the names of the libraries involved. Once I 
solve a problem my brain assumes all information related to it is 
now redundant so, out it goes.

Probably the problem is your distro doesn't provide Gnome1 libraries
anymore, yes?  The Gnome2 port of Gnucash has been just around the
corner for a few years now...

You could try something like Moneydance, if you're willing to shell
out a whopping $30.  They have a free demo version that is only
limited by the number of transactions you can enter (I think it's
100).  The hitch is you have to have a working Sun Java installed.

Versions for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

   For whatever the reason, Patrick provides KDE stuff, but not Gnome. It's

   I tried that about five years ago, then read that it died. I've installed
kmymoney and that's working for me -- imports the gnucash data just fine.

   There's also QHacc (I've no idea what the name is supposed to mean). I
downloaded it but didn't install it since I need only one tool.

Speaking of gnucash, 1.8.12 is supposed to incorporate OFX capabilities,
the new Quicken format, which supports direct statement imports from
major financial institutions. Unfortunately, it borked with font issues
when I tried it on Fedora, but I'm wondering if anyone has had some
success making OFX work with their online accounts.

Thanks,

If you look in to the ChangeLog, you should see an entry about why Pat
V. packages KDE and not GNOME.  It essentially came down to GNOME being
a bitch to package and simply not worth the hassle....

The GNOME devs don't seem to care about how easy it is to package the
bloody thing.

That said, there are several projects out there that provide their own
specially packaged GNOME for Slackware.

   I've been using KMyMoney-0.8 this afternoon and can report that it's quite
similar to gnucash in operation. I've found a couple of bugs that I've
reported to the authors (including one in which the transaction type resets
to the previous type when the focus moves to the next field).

   It has the same automatic completion (but requires the mouse and not just
the [Tab] key) and so far it's about equally speedy and easy to enter
transactions. So, I'm satisfied.

Message-ID: <014501c60ffc$4fa1b210$4001a8c0@winslow>

Happy New Year!

Does anybody here have any experience with NEC monitors?
I just installed SuSE 10.0 and it went very well.  The DSL connection was up and running before we did anything to the new install.  I still don't have it configured to update yet, but...in time.
I have a MultiSync 5FGe monitor and can't seem to get it set up.  Google didn't turn up any drivers (unless you like WinDoze).

Any ideas?

Bruce

What problem(s) are you having, specifically?

I was able to find basic specification info. on that monitor at
http://www.griffintechnology.com/archive/monitors/NEC16.html  and 
http://www.monitorworld.com/Monitors/nec/multisync5fgejc1731vma3.html

that might be enough to help you get a basic xorg.conf file working (I 
assume you're using X).

Message-ID: <20060103042933.B189B4064@joseph.doink.com>


I've fixed my "mouse trouble".  The synopsis of the problem is
that my system would lock up, being unresponsive to anything
except that I could still move the mouse pointer left & right.
Sometimes the system would spontaneously reboot.  All of these
problems started when I clicked a button on the mouse.

I tried a number of distributions, Mandriva being my goal, and   
found that only SuSE 9.2 worked at first.  Then I found an       
errata on Mandriva's site mentioning a number, maybe 6, serious  
bugs related to both X.org 6.9 and ATI drivers for my ATI Radeon 
card.  None of these bugs was what I was experiencing, but I     
took a shot at it anyway.  I installed the "free" version of     
Mandriva 2006.0 and configured the display as VESA, which was    
the suggested work-around for the other video driver problems.   
Wouldn't you know, it worked right away!                         

Then I tried Mandriva's 2006.0 PowerPack with VESA, no luck at
all.  A couple weeks ago Mandriva announced their "December Club"
release of the 2006.0 PowerPack which includes video driver
fixes, and all the updates up to that time.  The "December Club"
release wouldn't install.  As it turns out the "cooker" GPG key
which signed all the newer packages was missing from their RPM
key data.  I reverted to a fresh install of 2006.0 PowerPack.
Then I found the GPG key which was needed, and imported using
rpm.  This was enough to allow an 'upgrade' (not 'install') of
the "December Club" release.  When I did that upgrade I chose
the Radeon (fglrx) driver and the X.org option to *avoid* 3D
acceleration.

Everything works fine now.  I'm a bit timid, after spending all
that effort getting things to work, regarding testing the 3D
hardware acceleration.  But, I will get around to that.

Whew....

I don't know much about their services, however, I do know they use
astrisk based solutions and are local  (vancouver/portland) . You might
check them out. http://www.logitel.com/

I believe they might only be carrier switch hardware provider but they
might provide end user services too. I have used their services to place
voip calls with great success and quality.

But it does not print checks, which for me is a fatal flaw. Another fatal flaw 
is its QIF import sucks rocks, and its reporting is too limited for my needs. 
Otherwise it's a darned nice-looking application, with an excellent 
interface, reminders, and it manages multiple accounts gracefully. If you 
don't print checks or need QIF imports, KMyMoney is good.

I've been using Moneydance for over a year now, and I like it a lot. My 
finances are complex, so anything that saves me time and hassles is a good 
thing. The most recent update provides good reporting, and the user mail list 
is helpful and friendly.

In the "Desktop" menu there is an item for "yast".  Run that and go to 
hardware then "graphics card and monitor". You should be able to set the 
monitor type from there.  (That monitor is old enough to not have the 
"plug and play" capability on the monitor.)

If that does not work, I can dig out the lines to add to the config file 
to make it work.

Carla,

   OK. I've never printed personal checks from any of the personal checkbook
software I've used since 1986. I do, however, print business checks and
SQL-Ledger keeps getting better and better at this. Dieter's added real batch
printing capabilities with a "select all" button as well as being able to
select individual payable checks.

   Isn't QuackBooks import a one-time event?

   I don't need either. I find the UI too mouse dependent. The date fields are
spinner widgets, but the user cannot highlight the entire date (or an
individual field) and type in the correct value. Instead, each field (year,
month, day) must be individually highlighted and the arrow controllers used
to change the value. I guess this makes Windows users comfortable, but I find
it very slow and inefficient.

   There's also QHacc and another one from France that has a name something
like 'grisle'. I'm still disappointed that the gnucash crew won't keep that
working in Slackware and Debian. I liked it much better.

Quacken, not QuackBooks. :) Not necessarily. Not all banks or credit card 
vendors support direct-downloads of your account data, but do provide QIF and 
MS Money exporters. And even if it is just a one-time event, it shouldn't be 
as horrible as KMyMoney makes it. You have to set up all of your accounts 
first, then perform the import. The import itself is buggy and introduces too 
many errors to be useful.

   As I wrote in response to Jason's information, I don't do on-line banking.
I did find that the gnucash importer worked perfectly, and that relieved that
concern.

   KMyMoney2 has a large development staff (according to the manual), so
perhaps they'll smooth the rough edges in the not-too-distant future.

Happy New Year,

Rich

This monitor has been a problem in every version of SuSE I have tried. 
David was good enough to point me to a web site that had the specs for the 
monitor and I was able to modify the xorg.conf file using Sax and the screen 
looks a lot better now.

Many financial institutions are moving towards OFX exports, which I
think was implemented with Quicken 2005. From the moneydance docs, it
seems like they can use OFX too, but I don't know if they support direct
imports from websites, or do downloads have to be imported first. If
anyone has experience with that, I'd appreciate insights, if it works OK
or not.

Thanks,
Mike

Moneydance supports direct imports, and online bill paying as well.

someone here can point me in the right direction.

   When a block of code is highlighted in one buffer, and [Esc]-% pressed to
copy it, the first letter on the next line is converted to uppercase. So,
each time, I need to fix that before switching to a different buffer to paste
the code (using [Ctrl]-y. Annoying. Should be fixed. I know less than nothing
about elisp, too.

Can you find out what function [Esc]-% is calling?  In the problematic
buffer do:

[Ctrl]-h k [Esc]-%

([Ctrl]-h k runs describe-key, and will tell you about what [esc]-% is
doing) It may shed some light on the situtation, as your keybindings
may be different from some one else's, but the function names should
be reliable.

Rogan,

   A-ha! This is great to know.

   And, it turns out I presented the wrong command. It should be [Esc]-c. Now,
I see that capitalizes the following word (which is exactly what it's doing),
but it also copies the blocked text to the mouse buffer for pasting in a
different emacs buffer.

   So, looking at my handy-dandy GNU Emacs Quick Reference Card, I see that I
was doing it incorrectly all this time; mea culpa! What I should have been
doing -- and will do from now on -- is block the text, then use [Esc]-w to
copy it (where Ctrl-w cuts it), followed by ctrl-y to yank it back in the new
buffer.

Thanks for straightening me out, Rogan,

Rich

Well, it says I should use Redhat or SuSE with Mandriva coming in third, 
but failing the 64 bit test.

However, Mandriva IS available in 64 bit versions, and has been for some 
time.

Since that's what I'm using, and my system seems to be running... I hope 
it's not a figment of my imagination...

It told me I should be using Gentoo or Slackware, which seems about right.

David,

   Not Linspire??? Sheesh! ;-)

   Since they write that currently they're focusing on beginners rather than
experienced users I'm surprised that Slackware is on the list.

Windows' SMB/CIFS (file/print service, among other things).  Windows boxes
tend to broadcast so it isn't unusual to see a lot of them in the logs
on a broadcast network like DSL.  They're also fairly frequently probed,
but probably wouldn't be directed at you alone.  I just drop them without
logging them; too much noise to even bother watching.

Subject: [PLUG] Konqueror auto-complete(?)
Message-ID: <43BEAE40.4070403@comcast.net>

I don't know what this feature is called. In Konqueror, and other 
browsers, when filling in a text box, sometimes a drop-down box appears 
with entries that begin with the letters one starts typing. One can 
select one of these previously used entries by hitting the down arrow 
until you get the one you want, followed by <enter> or <tab>.

I have, on several occasions, typed the first couple of characters, and 
then hit <tab>. This causes two things: I don't have the correct entry 
in that particular text box, and I now have that incorrect entry added 
to the drop-down list for future uses of that box.

Does anyone know where this information is kept? Is it something like a 
cookie file that I could edit? I'd like to delete all the entries for 
that text entry box and start fresh.

I did try looking in /home/rsteff/.kde/share/apps/kcookiejar/cookies but 
didn't find anything obvious.

Dick,

   If you can find one of these terms in your browser, use grep to find it on
your hard drive. For example,

egrep -R <search_term> *

from your home directory will search recursively from there down. If it's not
there, change to your brower's install directory (/usr/local/, perhaps) and
try the search again.

Thanks. That's the file. I tried moving it out of that directory and 
restarting Konqueror, but the old information returned. I guess I would 
have had to shut down Konqueror first, then moved the file, in order to 
get a blank one. I was able to get away with editing the file, deleting 
the contents, and then saving the file. I'll go back later and try to 
find the specific information I want removed. For now, I know where to 
look, and I've eliminated the extra entries from the form I use frequently.

Thanks again.

Good idea, but I'm not sure it would have worked this time. The term 
appears in lots of files, and, even though I now know the right file to 
look in, I haven't located the line in the file I need to edit. The term 
appears in several places in that file, too, some of which I'll want to 
keep. Since I kept a copy of the old file, I should be able to pick it 
apart later on. Meanwhile, I learned another detail about Konqueror.

Message-ID: <20060106111052.0727398a@badger.had1.or.comcast.net.>

Hi. We have a misfunctioning Baytech RPC-3 Remote Power Control that is 
flashing its "help me" light in a specific code that a PDF manual claims 
means "system misconfiguration." And nobody can connect to the ethernet 
interface of this RPC. The obvious answer is that there's something screwed 
up with the Ethernet interface, and I should connect via the serial 
connection to fix it. But I can't find the cable to do it, and I don't want to look 
like a total ignoramus when I try to order one.

What I think we need is to connect via a serial port on one of the servers
(the normal D shaped jobbie) to what looks like an RJ45 connection 
labelled EIA-232. I don't know what to call this cable and I don't know if 
I need to specify "cross over", "null modem" or anything. 

What do I call this cable, and can I buy one in Portland or do I have to 
order online?

Subject: [PLUG] HR4569, video conversion, and Senator Smith
Message-ID: <20060106192010.GA2818@gate.kl-ic.com>


I hope to be meeting next week with a staffer in Senator Gordon
Smith's D.C. office about HR4569, the Digital Transition Content
Security Act, which may work its way towards a vote this year,
if the MPAA gets their way.

I posted to plug-talk about this a couple of weeks ago, and the
thread got hijacked.  As suggested at the general meeting tonight,
I will post again on the main list.  If you want to talk about
car licenses or the perfidy of Republicrats or something else,
kindly change the subject line, OK?


HR4569 is intended to close the "analog hole" in the digital rights
management chain.    Many of us disagree with DRM on principle, and
fight the Motion Picture Association of Amerika to protect the
rights of fair use and free speech.  This goes beyond that, because
one side effect of HR4569 may be the destruction of post-1960
electronic technology in the United States.  

The "analog hole" is the place where video leaves your VCR or
DVD player as analog signals (typically as one or three cables)
to go to your TV set or DVD recorder or TIVO or whatever.  These
analog signals can be captured by a digitizer, and the bits can
be stored on a DVD or sent out on the internet.  The analog signals
can be marked in multiple ways to signify that they are not supposed
to be copied, with either a signal in the strip of black above/below
the field of the signal ( CGSM-A vertical interval signalling, or
the "broadcast flag" ) or with a steganographic technique that 
signals by twiddling the luminance levels of successive lines of
video ( VEIL or Video Encoding Invisible Luminance ).  

HR4569 demands that digitizing systems preserve this information,
and in particular that they respond to it and not digitize if they
detect VEIL or CGSM-A signals indicating "do not copy".  These 
signals are not difficult to extract if the system is specialized
to handle video.  If this bill passes, and your "Tivo-Reloaded"
detects these signals on a broadcast show, it will refuse to
record the show.  Since both CGSM-A and VEIL signals are fairly
easy to detect if you know you are looking for them, it is also
pretty easy to build a stripper circuit that takes them out or
mangles them, and passes the rest of the information through. 
Such a circuit is specifically forbidden by HR4569.

So what's my beef?  Where does the doom and gloom come from?  Why
is this so major, and not merely a small step in the gradual
elimination of our fair use and free speech rights?

While there are systems that specialize in digitizing video, that
are built by the millions with inexpensive high yield technology,
these aren't the only digitizers out there, nor are they the only
digitizers capable of turning analog video into bits.  General
purpose analog-to-digital converters are used in thousands of
applications, and the same component or system that might be used
in an electronics test system or a cell phone can be used to
produce a stream of bits that could be recorded by a computer.
This could be no more complicated than plugging a PCI digitizer
card into a computer (and this is probably how they prototyped
the Tivo before they built specialized hardware).  This could be
as sophisticated as using a multi-gigahertz bleeding-edge-technology
Tektronix digital oscilloscope to capture similar bits, then 
running the record into a computer for analysis.  This is done
all the time when video equipment is designed - that's how the
design engineer can test whether the inexpensive consumer gear
they are designing will work under a broad range of conditions.

So in fact there is no clear distinction between electronics that
can digitize video and electronics for other purposes;  placing
all-encompassing constraints on video applications must be applied
to all applications, or else the constraints are useless.  There
are billions of converter chips and instruments and legacy consumer
gear already made and in the world that can do this conversion.  
HR4569 will not apply in Canada or Mexico or Europe or Asia.  So
this bill does not do much hole closing at all.  It just robs
consumers of simple options to exercise their fair use rights.

The problem comes if the MPAA uses this monopoly grant of power to
extend their reach to close more of the hole.  They would be enabled
by this bill to demand that a new Tektronix digitizing oscilloscope
have CGSM-A and VEIL technology built into the scope.  Irksome and
expensive, with the side effect that these instruments would be 
much less useful for developing video technology in the US.  But
the hole is still not plugged, just restricted on the margin.

The billions of analog-to-digital converters produced each year
are the next plausible target.  HR4569 does not recognize the 
difference between a component and a system; again, there is 
no clear technological distinction.  So the MPAA is entitled
to use their monopoly power to exercise prior restraint against
chip manufacturers, and distributors, to ensure that these chips
are fitted with detectors for CGSM-A and VEIL.  And this is where
the system collapses.  

A general purpose chip analog-to-digital converter can be used in
a number of different ways.  It can operate at a wide range of
sampling rates, so it is impossible to find line 21 in the vertical
interval to find CGSM-A, or to detect the characteristic 7200Hz
luminance signal of VEIL, because this requires recognizing many
details about the video signal and knowing accurately "what time
it is".  Chips don't know these things - this knowledge is
applied at the system level.  In fact, specialized video chips
could be run at different rates by the same sort or tricks that
computer overclockers use;  even if all these detectors were hard
coded into a chip, they are likely to be easily fooled by software
or hacking.  Yet the manufacturers and distributors of the chips
are held accountable, and subject to half-million dollar fines
per component, if their components can be used or abused this way.

Can you imagine the chilling effect this will have on the 
availability of electronic components in the US?  Who would take
the risk?  All electronic development will move overseas by the
threat of lawsuit.  New technologies will get developed there. 
At some point, even system repair moves there, or doesn't get done.
Who wants to take the risk of selling test equipment in the US?

As I mentioned, VEIL technology works on a 7200Hz luminance signal
added to the video field.  If a video system detects that, it is
not supposed to record it.  So imagine I am an LA cop, and I don't
want to be recorded the next time I beat up a Rodney King.  With
an LED flashlight modified to produce a 7200Hz luminance signal
broadcasting "don't record me", I can wield my truncheon without
worries.  Or perhaps I am a terrorist in Iraq, wishing to escape
observation from a US military camera surveilance system.  I buy
the same flashlight. turn off the cameras with it, and hide my
bomb or assassinate my target.  

Or I could build a very big 7200Hz flashlight and sit outside the
perimeter of a Hollywood movie set, shutting down the digital
movie cameras.  Let the MPAA enjoy a taste of what they created. 
They wouldn't have many options - all their cameras are from
overseas, and bought on the grey market, because their own
stupid law shut down the legitimate channels.  

My, I think this has turned into a flame.  Time for my meds ...
Ah, that's better!


So what does this all mean, and what can you do about it?  First,
learn more about the bill.  You can read more about HR4569 at 

http://static.publicknowledge.org/pdf/HR-4569-DTCSA-Analog-Hole.pdf
http://www.technewsworld.com/rsstory/47939.html

Look up "analog hole", "DRM", "CGMS" and "VEIL" on Wikipedia.  You
can also go to the Electronic Frontier Foundation at www.eff.org
and follow the growing protest. 

The bill is being sponsored by the ranking members of the House
Judiciary Committee,  Chairman James Sensenbrenner (R) of the
5th Congressional District of Wisconsin, and John Conyers (D)
of the 14th Congressional District of Michigan.  They come up
for re-election this year.  A campaign contribution to the
appropriate opposing campaign ( D, R, G, L, or other), with an
explanatory note to all the campaings, would be a sincere way
to say "you are SO FIRED!"  

A letter to your own Congressional representative would help. 
This HR4569 crock of fertilizer may make it to the Senate, which
is why I am planning a meeting with Senator Gordon Smith's staff. 
Sen. Smith heads the Commerce committee, which will have a lot
of influence on whether this thing passes.

OK, so you may dislike Smith, maybe just because he is an "R".
But that doesn't mean we can't influence him to focus on the
concerns of Oregon businesses and citizens.  Besides lots of
video and measurement companies, we are the hub of the Open
Source universe.  If we can convince him of the value of, and
the constituency for, open source concerns, he might become a
good ally for us.  Single issue letters supporting open source
or opposing the ideas behind HR4569 might help make that 
happen.  A rule of thumb in politics is that a single written
letter approximates the opinions of 1000 constituents.   It 
costs about $4 per voter for Smith to run a campaign.  So in
some sense, a postal letter to Smith on this issue is worth
about $4000 .  So get writing!  Again, a polite well written
letter on paper in a stamped envelope counts for more than an
email or fax or phone call.  An office visit counts for even
more; the Senator has open meetings with constituents on
Thursday mornings.

If you have connections to Tektronix, or Intel, or some other
company that does measurement or video or bits, please make
your concerns known to cow-orkers and managers.  At the CEO
level, they probably don't have a clue about the connection
between this legislation and their future survival;  they might
just want to keep a few customers in Hollywood happy.  If they
realize that the future of their company and their job is at
stake, most CEOs value risk reduction and professional
survival more than they value slightly increased sales.  Help
shape their opinion before they get a call from a politician.

So, learn, discuss, write, and take action.


Again, I am posting this to the main plug list rather than
plug-talk because this approach was the consensus of the general
meeting last night, and threads have a way of getting hijacked
on the talk list.  If you think this is inappropriate for the
main list (and I am uncomfortable about it) we can move it back
to plug-talk, but enforce some discipline to keep the discussion
on-topic.

There's no standard that I'm aware of.  You'll have to look up the
pinout in the manual, get a DB9F -> RJ45 convertor and plug in the pins
in the right spots.  (Though the PDU should've come with a correctly-
pinned convertor.)

Graybar, Norvac, Fry's and maybe Radio Shack sell the convertors.  I've
used the tip of a pocketknife to push the pins in, but the li'l red &
white tool for that ain't expensive.

If you really wish to keep your thread reasoned and topical, I would
strongly suggest you refrain from childish pot-shots such as the above
quoted.  You say stupid things like that which you may believe everybody
agrees with (who wouldn't, right? ...uh-huh) but you still make yourself
look unprofessional and downright childish.

I strongly agree this bill is a Bad Idea(TM).  However, we are *not*
going to convince anybody of the legitimacy of our ideas if we don't act
consistently professional.

Neat idea, just needs a better implementation.

I was actually referring to his spelling of the MPAA.  Calling large
groups childish names isn't going to help you prove your point.  The top
part of what I quoted was my attempt to show that Keith wanted to keep
the thread on topic and civil.  Below the following <snip> he lost a bit
of the civility and professionalism I thought he was going for.

You have my apologies if my writing wasn't clear enough.

And incidentally, I didn't change the thread in plug-talk, but did ask
for clarification twice on points that were brought up after the thread
had lost its original meaning.

[snip of very good reasons to oppose anything like HF4569]

Keith, I work at Tek and have forwarded your excellent write-up to 
corporate council for intellectual property.  I'll check back with 
him next week when we meet to review invention disclosures.

And, yes I'll be in touch with my representatives.  I actually called 
Wu's office before Christmas when I first found out about the bill.

Thanks for bringing this to the PLUG general list as it's the only 
PLUG list I read.

Suppose you have two non-xinerama screens in X.  They are both
displaying properly, but you don't know how to move the mouse pointer
from one screen to the other.  Ug, how do that thing, ug?  Have
googled unfruitfully.  

Thanks for pointers (heh).

Move it to the edge ;)  I'm assuming you've tried moving it to the
obvious edge, but have you tried moving the pointer off the other
three screen edges? It may be that your multi-screen setup is not
configured to reflect your physical setup. (it may think your monitors
are stacked one above the other, for example.)

Subject: [PLUG] qmail, daemontools on gentoo: Can't Make Work
In-Reply-To: <OMEBINHFEBMFOKIAIEADIEOJDMAA.ble.nordlund@verizon.net>
Message-ID: <OMEBINHFEBMFOKIAIEADKEFODNAA.ble.nordlund@verizon.net>

All-
I have been struggling with getting qmail to run on my gentoo machine.  In
stepping through a gentoo howto (
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/qmail-howto.xml ) for qmail and vpopmail, I run
into trouble right after installing qmail and daemontools.  The howto says
to go ahead and launch daemontools and get the service up and running so it
can be checked for proper operation (this is only a couple steps into the
howto).

I get a string of errors upon launching svscan:


bash-2.05b# /etc/init.d/svscan start
 * Starting service scan...
[ ok ]
SERVICE(send), QMAILDUID(201), NOFILESGID(200) or QMAILLUID() is unset in
./run
LOG_OPTS:
LOG_DEST: /var/log/qmail/qmail-send
Error in logging setup!
Some error detected in send, sleeping for 90 seconds for safety
SERVICE(smtp), QMAILDUID(201), NOFILESGID(200) or QMAILLUID() is unset in
./run
LOG_OPTS:
LOG_DEST:
Error in logging setup!
No CDB file found ()
Some error detected in smtp, sleeping for 90 seconds for safety

wash, rinse, repeat (apparently every 90 seconds)

If I go ahead and proceed to test the operation of qmail, it does not appear
to be working at all.  However, qmail-send, qmail-clean, qmail-lspawn, and
qmail-rspawn are all running, under the process supervise.  As a result, I
am hoping that something above will be recognized by someone who can steer
me in the right direction.

I am assuming that the missing QMAILLUID would only impact the logging
function, so I wonder if the "No CDB file found" might be more significant.
The QMAILL user does exist and the ID is 201.  I have looked at the run
scripts under /service and they are referencing other files that must be
giving them all the user ID's and group ID's that seem to be correct, since
the main run files don't specify any of them directly.

I hate to bug everyone with what is probably a bonehead mistake, but I've
been spending late nights on this, off and on, for two months now.  Any
pointers?

Thanks,
Brian.

They aren't "joined" screens, they are separate.  And, yes, the user
has tried moving the pointer in all directions.

Did you try the function keys?

The various desktops in enlightenment, for example, can be accessed using 
alt-F? just as virtual terminals are at the console.

Perhaps you should describe the setup more fully?  Two X servers on two
separate video cards on one box?  If so, try Synergy.

Or configure one X server for multi-head instead of running separate X servers;
it's not that hard--here's what my ServerLayout looks like:

Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier     "mulit-head configuration"
        Screen      0  "Screen0" LeftOf "Screen1"
        Screen      1  "Screen1" 0 0
        InputDevice    "Mouse0" "CorePointer"
        InputDevice    "Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard"
        Option      "Xinerama" "on"
        Option      "Clone" "off"
EndSection

The Monitor, Device and Screen sections are configured as usual, except
identifiers are unique for each type.

We tried (what seemed like) the obvious Alt-F7, Alt-F8 and

Huh, well, it is possible to set it up so that you can move between
separate x clients (non-xinerama) on the same x server by moving the
mouse off the screen.  It sounds as if you are running multiple x
servers though -- which is probably not the most efficient way, unless
you strictly need them.  If so, they should show up on separate tty's,
as others have suggested.

The Ctrl+Alt+F8 switch is only going to have an affect if you have two 
config files and have issued one startx command for each one.  I'm 
guessing that you're instead dealing with one config file with two 
displays configured and no "xinerama" "on" option.

I'm with Wil on wanting to see the config file.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0601080948080.9630@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Everyone knows the abilities of LaTeX to produce beautifully typeset
documents, particularly when there are mathematical equations included.
However, there is life after text documents with LaTeX.

   After a lot of work and tremendous help from Herbert Voss in Berlin (the
TeXpert who wrote the books on LaTeX Math Mode and PSTricks), I have a form
for use in an optical mark recognition (OMR) scanner. The strobe marks for
timing are built with the \rule{} command while the marking boxes use the
\framebox{} command. It's all in a table for precision placement. I don't
think that I can attache the 62K pdf file, but I'll send it to anyone who
would like to see it.

   I'm sure that some of you, particularly in an education environment, use
scannable forms and now you can make your own. The code's available under the
GPL (or whatever equivalent -- opend document license, perhaps -- is
appropriate) for modification. What the heck, it's pretty easy once you
understand how to go about it. :-)

   I did research on OMR scanners and found one at a reasonable price ($750)
from the MB Group in Basel, Switzerland. It reads 12 channels on a "page"
3.25" wide and up to 14" long. My form uses 10 of those channels on a form 8"
long. They make and sell larger units (14+ channels), single- or dual-side
reading, and forms up to 8.5" wide. Of course, prices start over $2,000 and
go up from there.

   Anywho, I thought this was something different that may be of interest and
use to others who read this list.

Ken,

   No. I think that Diebold's voting machine business model is that of the
Chicago Democratic machine: vote early, vote often.

   Ya know, it ain't all that difficult to tabulate results from the cards (or
the equivalent form on a touch screen display). Not only should it all be
open source, there's so much prior art going back to the early days of IBM's
tabulators, that it's no secret. What Diebold's issue is with North Carolina
I've no idea.

   However, the MB Group does make caseless scanners for inclusion in one's
own hardware (e.g., lottery or voting machines) so feel free to take your
idea and run with it. I'll do the forms for a modest fee.

Hi Brian

You should have these users, you probably do:

Here you indicate that the qmaill uid is 201

Something odd there.

Have a peep at these files:
/var/qmail/bin/config-sanity-check (this is the one producing the errors you report)
/var/qmail/control/conf-common     (sets QMAILLUID)
   this line:
   QMAILLUID=`id -u qmaill`

The cdb files live here "/etc/tcprules.d/". If there are no *.cdb files in that directory, have a look at
/etc/tcprules.d/Makefile. You will want to generate them.

I thought he was being quite professional. There aren't many ways to

out an example or two. You must be the person who changed the thread in

HI

Some of the partition is reserved for su use.

It is generally 5%..

I believe he menioned the used space, not the free space.  And that's a

Message-ID: <659b9ea30601090956pf5670bucb2189fb6c315ef3@mail.gmail.com>

I have a few SuSE 8.2 machines.  Every 30 reboots, the OS does a disk
integrity check to make sure there are no bad sectors on the disk. 
Since this is a 200 GB disk, it can take 20 to 30 minutes.  Is there a
way to detemine how many more reboots before that check?  I'd like to
be able to prepare better.  Anyone know where this is stored, and even

I am aware of the 5% reserved for su. However it appears that more than 18%
of the disk space is unaccounted for by du.

It'll depend completely on what filesystem you're using: ext2 or ext3? 
reiser? xfs? ???

For ext{2,3}, try "tune2fs -l /dev/sda1" (substituting '/dev/sda1' 
with your local device). Compare the "Mount count" field with "Maximum 
mount count."

I'm unfamiliar with reiser filesystems, so someone else will need to 
chime in for them...

Check the output of 'tune2fs -l /dev/XXX'; you'll find "Mount count" and
"Maximum mount count".  I don't know if "Mount count" is a lifetime total
or if it is reset by fsck; at any rate, you should be able to test for
count mod max == 0.

I seem to recall seeing a question like this some time back (years
ago).  IIRC, the answer was that some files had been orphaned in the
filesystem -- the data existed, but there were no directory entries
pointing to them.  Thus, counting used space by traversing the
filesystem did not count those files, and showed a discrepancy with
df, which presumeably uses some other method of determining free space
(I've no idea how it does this).

If this is the case, running fsck on the afflicted partition (in
single-user mode, or with it unmounted) should track down the files
and put them in  /mythtv/lost_and_found *or some similarly named
directory).  At that point you can look at them and see if it's
something you need or not.

I could also be remembering this all wrong, but in any case, a quick
(well, ~20 min) fsck isn't a bad idea :)

It's possible there are files that have been unlinked but are still held
open.  Try 'lsof |grep DEL' (as root) to find files that are unlinked
but still have inodes and blocks in use.  Read this to understand this
phenomenon: http://nakedape.cc/wiki/UnderstandingUnixFiles

Usually when I've seen that, it's due to either sparse files or
filesystem corruption.

Before fsck'ing it, try totaling an 'ls -s' of the recursive contents
of that directory... that'll give you the "actual" on-disk block
usage.  That can differ significantly from that reported in the
filesystem metadata.

Something like:
  for i in `find . -type f` ; do ls -s $i | awk '{print $1}' ; done

Compare that total *  your block size to the DF/DU.

For a read-only fsck of the partition, check your local manpages.

xfs uses a different type file system

<quote>

 An XFS filesystem has up to three parts: a data section, a
       log  section,  and  a  realtime section.

<unquote>


Not being an expert in this area <don't use XFS, so no actual
experience> this will be my last word..


Convert to reiserfs and repost...

Paul & Wil,

Thanks for the help.  It appears this is reiser FS; does that mean it
should be doing the disk integrity check at all?  I suppose this will
show my ignorance about filesystems, but if it is a journaled system,
does that mean I have misdiagnosed the problem?  In fact, I did not
see a message indicating that it was doing a HD check, but reboot took
a while and I just assumed this was the case based on previous
experience.

Wouldn't sparse files cause things to go the other way?

There are lots of ways that the "file" level view differs from
the "partition" level view.  I am assuming that /mythtv is 
the mount point for a separate partition /dev/hda5 , and that 
some other disk partition is mounted on / .  If /dev/hda5 is
mounted on /, and /mythtv is merely a directory located in /,
then there is something like 12GB stored in other directories
also located in / .  But df does show /mythtv as a mount point,
so that isn't it...

Assuming that /mythtv is indeed on a separate partition, the
numbers are challenging to explain, but there are situations 
that could cause them.  Some file system types dynamically
allocate inodes and directory tables, the metatdata on a partition
that describes where stuff is.  If you had an enormous number of
very small files, the file contents (reported by du) would be
smaller than (file contents)+(metadata), which is reported by df.
However, it seems unlikely that anything labeled "XXXXtv" would
be an enormous bunch of tiny files.

Another likely possibility is a corrupt file system.  A whole
bunch of the disk may be improperly allocated to nonexistent
files.  First, do a sync.  An fsck might be called for.  

While this is not what you are reporting, it is possible to have
du report a vastly larger number than df, because of hard-linking
in files.  The backup system I use makes enormous numbers of hard
links from different filenames to the same data;  du counts all
the linked filenames separately, while df counts them only once.
So I have partitions on my backup disks that report a df value of
240GB, while du -s reports 48000GB (after a few hours of runtime).
Again, this is not happening to you, but you may see something like
it someday.

This isn't necessary, since this is essentially what 'du' itself does.

No, blockless regions in sparse files will not be reported in either du
or df.  Try, for example, to create an empty sparse file and compare the
output of du and df:

dd if=/dev/zero of=test.0 bs=1k count=0 seek=1M

I'm not really sure; how do I tell?  Neither reiserfsck nor
reiserfstune seem to indicate a switch for checking the version of a
partition.

Doh, I was using another reference machine and it looks like that one
is reiserfs, but the others are all ext3.  So, in fact I've got my
answer.  But, something else looks worrisome: what does this mean from
"tune2fs -l /dev/hda3":

Filesystem features:      has_journal filetype sparse_super
Filesystem state:         not clean
Errors behavior:          Continue

"not clean?"

Subject: [PLUG] SCSI Tape being offlined
Message-ID: <43C2E0B8.8000709@acm.org>

I'm trying to help a friend sort out a problem with FC4, bru, and an 
EXABYTE tape changer.

What bothers me is at the last where the SCSI host adapter, the 3ware 
device and some usb drivers share the same interrupt.

This is the error message he's getting.

  WARNING:  Kernel Errors Present
      que cdb=  a5   0   0  56   0  52   0   1   0   0   0   0

host 0...:  1 Time(s)
     scsi: Device offlined - not ready after error recovery: host 0...:
2 Time(s)

After much google.com'in  I sill haven't found a clue as to the problem. 
  My first suggestion is to disable the USB devices but I can't find a 
way to make the kernel ignore them and can't get at the server to try it 
in the BIOS settings.

Any suggestions or has anyone seen similar.  Oh yeah, Tolis Group is out 
of ideas also.  He has done everything they asked including installing a 
different SCSI host adapter for the tape changer.

It looks like you've got a pretty old (pre-2000) system with a *bunch* 
of add-in cards. I don't know how adept those systems are at sharing 
interrupts.

Also, I'd expect to see an ide0 listing; I think it's usually at #14. 
Is the first IDE channel supposed to be off-line?

   Ouch! Those guys are (at least, were) the very top of the line. One of
their folks wrote the floppytape driver, and all of them were outstandingly
helpful with my tape drive problems years ago. I dealt with BRU, Inc., then
with the Tolis Group. Their techs contacted the Tandburg techs directly to
resolve problems I had. That's service!

   Other than lending moral support, I can't do much. It turned out that the
most recent problem I had was the SCSI driver not loading on a system
re-boot. Got that fixed.

   The only other issue I had were data read errors that turned out to be a
bad drive rather than the tapes. Once I upgraded from the slow, crappy SLR-5
to the SLR-60 I had no problems.

how well does it work for you?

Actually a brand new supermicro.  I haven't actually looked at the bios 
settings but my friend comes from a SUN background and might have 
over-configured though I thought it came with the OS installed.
    Also the Tolis Group engineer made some suggestions ( as I also did 
) that probably got the modules and system in this mess.  Seems bru 
doesn't like the newer SCSI host adapter drivers so an attempt was made 
to _down-grade_ to an older driver.

Interesting eh?  No _real_ ide drives involved that I know of.  It is a 
SATA/PATA system with the SCSI for the tape library.

   /dev/mapper/VolGroup00-LogVol00 is /
and
   /dev/sda1 is /boot


I might have to get in front of the console.  Or at the very least have 
him got back to factory/supplier default settings and possibly back down 
to an older kernel ( FC3? ).


Thanks for the input.  It's got me thinking some more.

Typically they are.  The message I got was they determined it was a 
hardware or OS problem that needed to be fixed before they could go any 
further.

I think I'll get remote access to the system and see if I can getteh 
tape drive and changer working without using bru.

My favorite error was a loose ( as in it fell off when I held the drive 
vertically ) SCSI id jumper on a CD-RW.  One time the driver thought was 
device 5 the next 0.  I still have the jumper taped to my monitor at 
home to remind me!  Softer than a clue-stick for sure.

   mtape is your friend, Rod. It's helped me diagnose and fix a number of
errors. When it _doesn't_ move tape you know you've got an earlier problem.

   Please keep us informed. I love a good mystery.

While working at Tektronix, I once spent the better part of an afternoon
tracking down a problem with a prototype.  I finally discovered a jumper
that was missing the metal contact!  I think this is what they call
a 'learning experience'.

I've got a new Supermicro with Opterons; all its IRQs show up in the 
new style:

The same is true on every Intel or AMD box in our server room. Of all 
the x86 Linux boxes on which I have accounts, I could only find XT-PIC 
interrupts on one: an older OptiPlex GX100 with an Intel 82801AA 
chipset I've got at home.

kpdf will allow you to select pages and save them as png or jpg.

   Yup. pdftk, the PDF Tool Kit.

"Pdftk is a simple, command line tool for doing everyday things with PDF
documents. Use it to merge PDF documents, split PDF pages into a new
document, decrypt input as necessary (password required), encrypt output as
desired, fill PDF forms with FDF data and/or flatten forms, apply a
background watermark, report on PDF metrics, update PDF metadata, attach
files to PDF pages or the PDF document, unpack PDF attachments, burst a PDF
document into single pages, decompress and re-compress page streams, and
repair corrupted PDF files (where possible)."

   It will also turn on the coffee maker in the morning if properly
configured. Cures bunions, too. Source tarball available.

Can it convert the tar ball into heating oil? I could really use that!

It turns out that a reboot freed up the space that was unaccounted for with
du. I guess there must have been filehandles open to files that had been
deleted.

Interesting.  Sounds like you have some misbehaving programs there.  Or 
maybe you were trying to make more disk space and just didn't realize 
they were all running.

For the curious, the following illustrates this (if you don't mind 
deleting all of the line-breaks.)

perl -e 'open(F, ">/tmp/foo-mypid") or die; print F "$$\n"; close(F); 
open(F, "/tmp/foo-mypid") or die; print "$$\n";sleep(10)' & sleep 1; 
export pid=$(cat /tmp/foo-mypid); rm /tmp/foo-mypid; ls 
-l /proc/$pid/fd; ls /tmp/foo-mypid; kill -HUP $pid

... and why does it always place a big Volume box in the middle of my
screen when I log into KDE? The weird window is 'always on top', and can
only be destroyed by killing the kded process (trial and error figured
this one out for me).

If it's relevant, I'm running on a very recent Gentoo installation.

If anyone has any ideas, please let me know.

josh,

   According to Google,
<http://developer.kde.org/documentation/library/cvs-api/kdelibs-apidocs/kded/html/index.html>

   The documentation is, ahem, sparse. It looks to me that this has something
to do with building services. For whom or what I've no idea.

According to the man page (doesn't Gentoo install them?)  
   kded -- triggers Sycoca database updates when needed

Sycoca?

System Configuration Cache.  Hmmm, a quick Google (I'm Feeling Lucky)
for sycoca and we find:

  Sycoca - Introduction

  Sycoca stands for System Configuration Cache and is nominated to be
  the succesor of kregistry. It is a light weight database optimized for
  looking up static system configuration information fast and with
  minimal memory usage.

  The database will offer read-only access to many clients at once. The
  database is read-only which means that looking up can be very fast
  since no locking or transaction operations need to be performed. The
  database is created/updated by kbuildsycoca from human readable
  configuration files. kded monitors these configuration files and will
  call kbuildsycoca to update the database when a change in any of the
  configuration files is detected. 

So maybe you should let it run to gather the information or check the
logs to see if any errors are being reported or maybe run a kbuildsycoca
to make sure you have the cache built in the first place.

Or maybe read up on sycoca at
  http://developer.kde.org/documentation/library/kdeqt/kde3arch/ksycoca.html
aka
  http://tinyurl.com/exp66
and decide on what course of action works best for you.

Subject: [PLUG] converting scanned line art to a limited color set
Message-ID: <20060112011023.6684E8F1E@tinman.seitzassoc.com>


When working on a design, I print out the schematics using a laser
printer and then make changes on the paper using a red pen.  Then I send
or hand carry my marked up schematics to another person who does the
schematic entry.  What I would like to do is send them my changes via
email, ftp, etc.

I can scan the schematics in binary(B&W) mode, but I lose the red color
of my changes.  If I scan in color I end up with a 6 MB file.  What is a
good way to convert the 6 MB file to a file containing only the three
colors black, white, and red?  I've tried using the quantize function
within imagemagick, but it gives me 3 shades of grey.

thanks,

Galen...

There are some big questions to ask here...

How big is your scan?
Are there any other colors other than B&W and Red?

I would probably dump the image into GIMP and drop the color base down 
from 16 bajillion colors and reduce it down to 256 or 16 colors. That 
will definately reduce the size of the file.

I think there's a way (in the obtuse options of convert) to specify 
indexed color and which colors are in the index.

I was sort of hoping to avoid GIMP, primarily because I have limited
experience with it.  If this is easy do with GIMP, I'll explore that
option.

This question got me curious.  So I tried it with the Slug Velo host
patch image, you can see th original at http://www.slugvelo.org/ I'm
referring to the green patch image.

The full sized, full color PNG file is 1.2MB.

Loaded image into Gimp.
Right Click, File, Save As, renamed to color_test1.gif
  (Gimp will auto convert based on filename)
Said OK to exporting and converting to indexed
Accepted all defaults

New file  is 393K

Now for real optimization

CTRL-A to Select All
Right Click, Image, Mode, Indexed
Accepted "Generate Optimized Palette" option, changed the number of
colors to 4.
Right Click File Save As color_test2.gif

New file is  56K

This seems to be easy enough (I had to do it to see how to do it) and
the fiel size trimming, 1.2MB to 56K, would seem to be the kind of thing
you're looking for.

Repeated the indexing option, this time changing the number of colors to
3.  

New file is 48K

You can see the files I"ve just described and a restatment of the
process at http://www.patch.com/colordepth/

I'm trying to do a recursive copy of a set of files from point A to point 
B.  This is part of an rpm spec file, and I'm trying to use the 'install' 
binary (from coreutils) to do it.

The problem is that 'install' doesn't seem to have the capability to copy 
directory A and all its contents and subdirectories to point B.  When I 
try what seems like the obvious version:

install -t /home/rpmbuild/rpm/tmp/ntp-root/usr/local/share/doc/ntp html

I get:

install: omitting directory `html'

which means I don't install squat.  I can't see any way to do this other 
than specifying each subdirectory manually, which is absurd; if I have to 
do that, I'll just use a 'cp -r' or tar pipe instead.  Am I missing 
something?

There's nothing misbehaving about deleting a file that is open.  That's a
long-standing design strategy for getting a file that you need for an
operation, but won't need once the program is finished (for any reason).

It's a bug that you can't do that in windows.  (Or rename a file that is
open... what's up with THAT?)

David,

You should take a look at rsync (http://rsync.samba.org/). rsync has
the ability to do recusive copies, preserve file permissions, and much
much more.

A one liner like:

rsync -av <source directory> <dest directory>

should do the trick... look at rsync's man page. it's filled with
numerous options. I use it frequently over ssh for various things
including incremental back-ups and systems imaging. Hope this helps...

-Kevin

Only that install cannot do that.  For that, use 'cp -a'.

Thanks, but... not to sound cranky, but I already know how to do this 
*with other tools*.  What I'd like to know is if it's possible using 
'install'.  If not, it makes me wonder what advantages, if any, 'install' 
has.  

I suppose that it's possible there are none, and install is simply 
obsolete in the face of modern versions of things like tar, rsync, and cp.

Of course not.  But deleting 10GB of open files is a different beast.  
The OP's situation suggests that there were either several long-running 
programs each with 1-2 large open fd's or maybe one MCP with delusions 
of grandeur.

> That's a long-standing design strategy for getting a file that you
> need for an operation, but won't need once the program is finished
> (for any reason).

Certainly a valid one, but 10GB!?  If these are some kind of tempfile, 
then I would definitely call it a bug that they were still open (unless 
the program is documented as requiring that much temp space.)  Did the 
program expect to finish much earlier?  Is it in a hung state?  If it's 
just that the user deleted files trying to free-up disk space, then I 
guess the program needs a feature to respond to that.  One should not 
need to reboot to reclaim one's disk space.

Having open fd's on deleted files is not a bug, but in this case I think 
it could be a symptom of something wrong (who's fault it is or whether 
it's a big deal would require a bit more info.)

I've been thinking of this myself.  Most non-GNU implementations of cp
don't have all of the features that GNU cp does, so install was a
special tool to with enhancements for that.

Here are the things that GNU install does that cp cannot:
  o Create destination directories and copy the file in one command
  o Set mode, owner and group (cp can only preserve these)
  o Strip symbol tables from binaries

GNU cp can:
  o Make sparse files from files with enough null-bytes (don't know what
    install does with sparse files)
  o Copy directories recursively
  o Make hardlinks instead of copying

I'm not clear on how install handles file replacement; there are times
when you want to unlink the existing file first (or even rename it to a
temporary name and unlink afterwards), in the case of things like
libraries, where the old file will remain mapped into memory for
processes using it.  (Try "lsof|grep DEL" sometime after upgrading
libraries.)

As others have mentioned, install has no ability to do recursive 
copies. The reason, I suspect, is that the -m switch allows it to set 
permission modes -- but mode setting is typically incompatible with 
the mixed files/directories content implied by recursive copying.

Others have suggested rsync and "cp -a"; the first isn't a tool I'd 
use in a rpm build setting, the second will work only on systems with 
GNU cp (since the -a switch is non-standard).

If cross-platform work is important -- and, admittedly, it may not be 
-- I'd suggest tar:

   tar cf - html | (cd %{buildroot}/usr/local/share/doc/ntp && tar xf -)

If you're assured of the presence of GNU tar, it's even easier

   tar c html | tar xC %{buildroot}/usr/local/share/doc/ntp

(Of course, if you have GNU tar, you probably also have GNU cp, in 
which case 'cp -a' will work just as well...)

install sets ownership and permission attributes, whereas other tools
can only set them to the current user or preserve the existing
attributes.

Modern?  A recursive cp hardly seems like an incredibly "new" concept...

Thanks for the very major effort.  Alas, I tried this with gimp but the
results weren't ideal.  It's really not gimp's fault.  My scans are not
great.  White isn't really white, and black isn't really black.  The 
right thing to do would be to learn how to make better scans.  That said,
I did figure out how to get acceptable results with convert.  Here's
the command I used:

    convert +dither -posterize 3 in.png out.png

 This is probably considered a basic question, but with 200 GB and larger drives more common than they once were, it arises more often. I get the impression that most Windows users never partition a drive, and most don't even install it themselves.
 
Logical partitions often serve the needs of Linux users as well as any other kind. My Debian boot partition is a logical partition. I believe you can have only one extended partition per physical IDE drive. How many logical partitions can it contain?
 
Linux users are often encouraged to subdivide an installation into separate partitions, and of course one might want to try a number of distros. A large hard drive provides enough space for all this, if it is properly managed.

Heh.  I've always just considered that number to be "more than I need."  
I guess "more than I need" == 24.

Understand that the primary/extended partitions are a BIOS/DOS artifact and
that logical partitions or volumes are from the LVM in Linux.  The BIOS/DOS
partitions become physical volumes (PV) in a volume group (VG), which itself
can be split into as many logical volumes (LV) as, well, as a volume group
can have.

How many LVs your VG can have depends on several things, but the number is
probably higher than you'll exceed--I have 11 on one box.

   In my ignorance of all this technical stuff, I have 12 partitions on this
server/workstation:

/dev/hda3        swap             swap        defaults         0   0
/dev/hda1        /                reiserfs    defaults         1   1
/dev/hda10       /tmp             reiserfs    defaults         1   2
/dev/hda11       /vm              reiserfs    defaults         1   2
/dev/hda12       /data1           reiserfs    defaults         1   2
/dev/hda13       /data2           reiserfs    defaults         1   2
/dev/hda2        /boot            reiserfs    defaults         1   2
/dev/hda5        /home            reiserfs    defaults         1   2
/dev/hda6        /usr             reiserfs    defaults         1   2
/dev/hda7        /usr/local       reiserfs    defaults         1   2
/dev/hda8        /opt             reiserfs    defaults         1   2
/dev/hda9        /var             reiserfs    defaults         1   2

   It's been working just fine for almost 2.5 years.

Er, hrm, but... those are also called "logical partitions" in an
"extended partition".  I haven't mucked with those in so long and I've
been looking at AIX logical volumes so much I'd forgotten.

Wil,

   Yes, but they illustrate how many partitions I fit into one extended one. I
thought that was the original question.

I got a system to start puking at 16+ LVs on one physical drive several 
years ago.  sda1 -- sda16.  As soon as I dropped back to 10-12 all went 
well.  Made me re-think my "cleverness".  :-)

Do you know which version of LVM you were using, LVM v1 or v2?  If v1,
was it < 1.0.8?

There are a few possibilities for what these files were. This box is running
MythTV, and this partition is where the recorded programs are stored. This
is also where the buffer for live TV is written to a temporary file. The
temporary file for live TV is configured to only grow to 5G. I also have an
xbox as a remote frontend that mounts this partition via nfs. The files on
this partition are ussually delete through the MythTV UI, either locally or
remotely. MythTV frontend rarely hangs, but it sometimes does during
playback of a recorded show. In this case I would kill the frontend from the
command line and restart it. Perhaps this leaves open filehandles hanging
around. And perhaps filehandles are left open when operations are done using
the remote frontend. This still remains a mystery and I am keeping an eye on
the disk usage. The next time it happens I will hopefully know what caused
it.

Heh.  I've always just considered that number to be "more than I need."  
I guess "more than I need" == 24.

Somewhere between "lots" and "infinite". You'll start running out of

Number of disks you're likely to have and scarcity of device numbers.
Given you can have 15 conventional SCSI disks with only one controller,
you can use a lot of device nodes quickly. With merely 2 disks per
controller, scarcity isn't as a big deal quite as quickly with IDE.

I'm relatively certain that this restriction is not related to the disk
partitioning.  It's due to the way major and minor device numbers have
traditionally been allocated under linux.  With the introduction of udev
in the 2.6 kernel, it might not even be valid anymore.

Well, it wasn't in the first version of Unix that I used.  V7 Unix.  The One

And yes, I sometimes refer to anything added after V7 to be "modern
features". :)

My bad.  I used the term LV as in reference to a  partition inside a (

Add in something like Coraid's ATAoE and it will really start to get 
interesting.  Yes I lust for 16 PByte of storage.  What I'd store I have

On page 62 of Linux Format #75 has a PLUG related picture.  Combined with 
the title of the article it is pretty funny.

Also, the Larry Wall interview has a picture or two that were obviously 
taken in Portland.  I guess they are milking their OSCON trip for

Ideally it'd output to PNG or GIF, be able to be run from the command

GraphViz is about the only thing I have found.  (And it is still pretty 
ugly.)  It is about the only thing I have found where I can hand it the 
graph and say "go draw this".  Really big graphs get messy due to 
limitations of a 2d visual space.  (You can only have so many lines before 
the spirit of the Flying Spaghetti Monster inhabits your image.) 

I would be interested in finding something that works as well.  All useful 
layout software seems to think that you will sit at the gui and draw it. 
Few will generate diagrams from data.

I forgot...  There are at least two Perl modules that will interface to 
GraphViz.  http://www.cpan.org/ has more info.

Thanks Alan, I'll check it out.  The sample renderings don't look as bad
as some I've seen..

Thanks Bill, but JFreeChart doesn't render "graph" data types from what
I can tell from the sample renderings, it appears to only render
"graphs" of data.  By graph data types I mean a set of nodes and edges
that define the relationship(s) between the nodes.

thanks,
Brent

I hope so.  The line problem can only be solved by adding another 
dimension or some sort of interactivity. Neither I have time to code.

Brent,

   Have you looked at NetworkX and at mathplotlib? They're both Python addons;
the former for computational physics (as if there's any other kind, eh?) and
other networks. I know that mathplotlib can do directed graphs.

   There's also: <http://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs.html>,
<http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2005/02/msg01240.html>, and -- I think
-- SciPy.

There is always PostScript. Perhaps not the interface you were planning
on, but if all you need is to draw some lines it might be viable...

   PSTricks will plot from data, but I don't know for certain that it will do
directed graphs. Probably will, but I've not looked into that.

Subject: [PLUG] Would like to find a rackmount UPS locally
Message-ID: <43C94A53.4040606@telestream.com>

My church is doing some upgrades and I have been doing my best to try 
and save them some money.  We are looking for a UPS to go into a 19" 
Dell rack.  The UPS doesn't have to be rack mount but it would be best 
for how I would like the cabinet laid out.

Most other things I have acquired online in some form but the shipping 
on these heavier items can add up.  Does anyone know a place locally 
that sells used units for decent prices?  Or maybe works at a company 
that is willing to make a charitable donation of one?  I am looking for 
at least an APC 1500, but would prefer an APC 3000.  I can replace the 
batteries if needed, but the price should reflect that.  I haven't tried 
Freegeek, it just seems like they wouldn't have anything like this, but 
maybe I will give them a shot.

P.S. If you are a company that is willing to donate, I have a few more 
items I would like to get as well, but I will wait and see how this 
turns out.

Message-ID: <43C953DB.1090203@frankhunt.com>

I have in my paws a newly reconditioned APC SmartUPS 1000 (via 
RefurbUPS).  The batterys were new on 12/27.2005.  It is being replaced 
because it is too old for the current Windoze version of PowerChute 
(works fine on Linux with version 4.5.3 pf PowerChute Plus).  Anyways, I 
am ending up with three UPS's and I only need two.  SO, I am  willing to 
let it slip through my fingers for $100.  The unit cost $90 from 
RefurbUPS and the shipping was $40 so this is a pretty good deal.  I 
might be convinced to deliver the unit to a mutually agreed upon 
Starbucks for the price of a latte.

   I use apcupsd with my APC SmartUPS 1400 (also purchased from RefurbUPS, but
weighing in at 70 pounds; shipping was expensive). We've not had a power
outage from someone sliding into a pole and tripping the transformer, but the
winter's not over yet.

   I don't suppose that this will help you, but it may be of use to the
purchaser of your now-excess unit.

This is probably a good situtation to use the levels dialog in the
gimp to redefine what is black, and what is white.

When you open the dialog, (Tools -> color tools -> levels ) you will
see a histogram of the image, with three handles (indicator triangles)
on the bottom.  The left-most handle points to the black point, the
middle points to the grey point, and the right most points to the
white point.  The width of the histogram corresponds to the overall 
brightness of the color.. (I don't recall the proper term..).  In any
case, moving the black point (the left-most handle) to the right makes
things that are almost, but not quite black truely black.  Moving the
white point to the left makes off-whites true white.   Essentially, it
crops the image in terms of color.

Since you have three colors, you can fiddle with these sliders untill
you get optimal results, then you should be able to index into 3-4
colors.

Probably more work than you want to put into it, but it's a good trick
to know about, particularly when scanning messy documents.

Oh oops, my head wasn't on tight at that moment.  Aside from the UPS we 
need:

  QTY   Desc.
---------------------------------------------------------
   2    12 port power strips (or 4 rackmount six ports)
   1    4U drawer
   1    1U LCD/Key/Mouse
   2    48 port Cat6 patch panels & hardware to wall mount
   1    4 port KVM switch
   200  Bag of Cat6 RJ45 plugs
   20   or so velcro straps
   4    1U horizonatal wire management
   20   small wire management hooks that mount on

So some items are pretty small while other are large.  And I can settle 
for less on some things like the LCD if I need to.  Donations are always 
the best but we can pay if it's fair too.  It's just amazing how all 
this stuff adds up when you're finished.  The above is probably pushing 
$1800 or so on eBay, and with the UPS we could easily be on our way to 
$2500+.  So every little bit of savings helps.

Try doing a 'man top', and scroll down to the paragraph that talks

Ugh.  Please don't use Sendmail.  Try Postfix instead:

"us" is the percentage of time spent running user applications.
"sy" is the amount of time in the kernel.
"ni" is the time spent running "nice"ed processes.
"id" is the the time the CPU wasn't doing anything.
"wa" is the time the CPU was waiting for some I/O operation to complete.
"hi" is the time spent with the IRQ handlers.
"si" is the time spent with the soft IRQ handlers.

   I second the motion. Also, get the new Postfix book (by No Starch Press).
It will walk you through everything. Very highly recommended.

My man page mentions CPU states a number of times, but does not explain what the
various two-letter codes mean.  I am running kubuntu.  man -V top yields version
2.4.3, 2005-07-03

Subject: [PLUG] mrtg question: vastly different values
Message-ID: <20060115103343.21d4c035@badger.had1.or.comcast.net.>

Howdy.

I'm trying to track "mail queue size" and "system load" on one graph with mrtg. On this
particular system, I've seen mail queues 1500 long and system usage up to about 100. I'd 
like to demonstrate the correlation of these values to my PHB, so I'd like to have them
on the same graph.

I have a perl script on the remote system that outputs like this: 
mailq
5 minute average load
uptime
system name 
( this matches the requirements in the mrtg 'external script configuration' )
I have this in place for the mrtg configuration lines:
Target[c9.mailload]: `ssh blahblahblah /home/admin/mailq_load_4mrtg.pl`
Title[c9.mailload]: mailq and load
MaxBytes1[c9.mailload]:5000
MaxBytes2[c9.mailload]:150
Options[c9.mailload]:gauge,growright
PageTop[c9.mailload]:<h1>C9 Mail and Load History</h1>
YLegend[c9.mailload]:Load and MailQ info: snapshot info at query time
Legend1[c9.mailload]:Mail Queue Fill Status
Legend2[c9.mailload]:Current Load (5 minute average)
LegendO[c9.mailload]:load
LegendI[c9.mailload]:mailq

Alas, my blue line (load) is flat, which leads me to believe that it's 
not scaling on its own, but rather it's scaling in comparison to the mailq.
It's also possible that since the load has been very small (less than 1 all
night) that it's showing up as 0 in the mrtg logs.

If anyone else has done this, could you take a look and let me know what I'm
doing wrong? Or if I have it all right?

I need some help finding some information and resources about setting up a

fyi, that's probably the version of man, not the version of top.  Try 'top 
-v'.

But you're correct, the man page for top may not have the CPU state 
information spelled out.  It isn't in my version (from procps-3.2.5).


As a general rule, if you're going to tell someone to RTFM, it's a good 
idea to make sure the FM has the material there for them to R.

I've been using Postfix for a long time, and host email for a bunch of
my friends' domains. I run qpopper with DRAC and it works fine. However,
administration is a fully manual process: editing files, rebuilding the
hashes (I use a Makefile so it's not totally manual), etc.

For the email addresses within my domains, this is completely managable.
For all of my friends' domains, it's getting to be a timewaster.

I don't really want to leave Postfix, but I have no special attachment
to qpopper. I really need to set up something that allows virtual
domains, domain admins who can see and change only their own domain, and
maybe a user admin function so an individual user can reset his password
or set up a vacation message or a forward.

I've found a bunch of HOWTOs, and the ones that include some kind of
web-based administration use either PosftixAdmin or WebCyrAdmin. Any
comments on these, or on your favorite admin tools? I'm open to
something bigger (ISPman, webcp, etc.) as long as it doesn't require me
to run BIND or any FTP server. 

I'd be happy to post my list of mail server setup HOWTO links for you,
Randy, if you're interested in managing virtual users for multiple
domains.

I have been asked to try and configure a mail server for a client to enter
act with virtual servers running Microsoft Exchange 2003. I am new to using
Linux so that is a bit of a challenge for me so any helpful links or
information is appreciated.

GraphViz is pretty much the standard. The good news is that quite a few 
languages have bindings for it, so you won't need to descend to C/C++ 
from your favorite scripting/high level language in most cases. There is 
even an R binding for it.

By the way, it was only in the last few years that GraphViz became truly 
free as in speech. If that matters, check your licensing carefully. 
Debian had it in the non-free section for some time.

Also ... GraphViz works on Windows, if that matters. It does to me.

The next logical choice might be XFig. I'm pretty sure XFig has a 
text-based description language as well as the GUI.

Sounds like all you want is a gateway, maybe to do a little spam
filtering on the way in? I have used Postfix to protect Exchange from
the internet in the past, but that was a while ago. It's not too hard.

The books that others have mentioned will be very useful, though most of
Ralf's docs are also available on his web site and in the Postfix
mailing list.

The sparseness of KDE documentation is annoying at best. Even the 
basics, like on-line help, don't exist for much of the humongous project 
that KDE is. Apparently the fun of developing KDE itself, which is a 
high-quality project, is more than the fun of documenting it, since it's 
a volunteer project.

The core API and the QT toolset are fairly well documented, though. And 
there are some wonderful development tools like Quanta+, Kommander, and 
Korundum.

Subject: [PLUG] Correct use of 'tee'
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0601151727020.7766@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   The man page for 'tee' is so skinny, it's emaciated. I found it useless.

   I was trying to capture the errors in a 'make' to a file called
build_errors.log. When I tried 'make | tee build_errors.log' all I got was
the last line on the screen. The info command was no more forthcoming.

   Finally, I found a web page with a highly convoluted command line
(redirecting 3>&1, 1>&2, and so on) while piping various outputs through a
couple of different invocations of 'tee.' It worked, but I had four files;
two duplicates of what looked like the output of stdout and stderr.

   I guess that what I was getting was the output to stderr going to the file.
But, I even tried 'make 2>&1 | tee build_errors.log', but that didn't work
either. Should I be re-directing 1>&2 and sending that to the file with tee?

   *@$%!!)^ man page!

As I discovered last week, you can also add a '-a' to tee and it will
append, rather than overwrite the file you specify.

Rich -

Try placing the 2>&1 at the end of the line, meaning:

  make | tee build_errors.log 2>&1

What's wrong with the man page? The man page says that "tee - read from
standard input and write to standard output and files". And it covers how
tee does that. It does not describe how to fly to the moon, live forever, or
redirect i/o descriptors in the shell. If you want to use tee to capture
standard error, you first need to send standard error to standard out. Since
this is a shell functionality, it is described in mans page for shell.  In
bash the syntax you tried should indeed work:

make 2>&1 | tee log

although I believe the redirects apply only to make itself and not the
programs it launches (may be it applies to programs directly launched from
make, but after several levels of indirection redirects are lost for sure).
In csh there is no way to do this.

you might try the command "script" for this type of thing.

   $ script
   Script started, file is typescript
   $ make
   [...]
   $ exit
   Script done, file is typescript
   $ less typescript
   "typescript" may be a binary file.  See it anyway? y

Subject: [PLUG] mounting hdb1
Message-ID: <1137383270.8743.6.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I have a new install of Ubuntu 5.10 and I can't figure out the proper
terminology to mount hdb1.  hdb1 is the hard drive with a install of
SUSE 10 and I would like to be able to copy some files to Ubuntu on
hda1.  When I add hdb1 to fstab, it forgets that hda1 is where we are
supposed to be and won't let me even run a program due to the path being
wrong now.

# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>
proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0
/dev/hda1       /               ext3    defaults,errors=remount-ro 0
1
#/dev/hdb1      /home           reiserfs        user,noauto
/dev/hda5       none            swap    sw              0       0

#/dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto  0       0


Above is the current fstab.

This is what I would do

make a directory called

make an entry in fsab

/dev/hdb1	/mnt/suse_10	reiserfs	user,noauto   0 0

You need to give hdb1 its own directory, not shared by anything else. Try 
this:

/dev/hdb1      /home/suse10          reiserfs        defaults,user,noauto  0   
0

Is there an easy way to get to that hard drive to add the directory
without several reboots?

Adam,

   This is about the only information in the man page. However, it doesn't
help me learn the syntax that will do what I need.

Thanks,

It's my understanding that with Postscript I'd have to figure out the
layout and route all the lines myself, if I'm doing that I can just as
easily (or more, probably) output it directly to a PNG or GIF (or SVG,
all of which are the formats I'd like the rendering to be in the end.)

Thanks everybody,
  Thanks everybody for your suggestions, I've settled on using GraphViz
to render my directed graphs.  After downloading and installing it it
only took about 5 minutes to get a semi-workable rendering out of it,
it's really quite easy to render simple graphs reasonably well and it
looks like with some tweaking I'll be able to get a not-simple graph to
render well - and it outputs into all of the formats I want.

thanks,
Brent

No need to reboot....

Just make entries in the fstab

And then as root mount it..

root at root# mount /mnt/suse_10

Agreed, should work, wondering about the shell in use and what he's

Redirects are still going to be there.  Redirect is just the shell 
dup'ing file handles around a bit, prior to exec'ing- all children of 
the process will inherit the fd's the make process has open at 0,1,2 
(stdin,stdout,stderr)- this is exempting if it goes and switches the 
handles around on it's own, dumping to a log for example.

Freegeek is looking for an open source hardware testing program.
Ideally the default would be interactive & friendly. A plus would
be for this same program to have an advanced mode, which exercises
each part of a system simultaneously, aggressively & repeatedly
for days.

When Ubuntu is booting I noticed that it tries to link to the
ntp.ubuntulinux.org (I think) to synchronize the computer's internal
clock.  It shows a failure.
What do I need to edit to get this to work?

This is clearly not what you had in mind, but it's all I've heard of.
It might meet your burn-in needs.  It was originally developed by
VA Linux.

What is the error message?

Your guess is correct, it is trying to use Network Time Protocol to
synchronize with ntp.ubuntulinux.org. Could be a nameservice failure,
overloading of that NTP server, or your clock is badly wrong. How do you
prefer your clock chip set? Local time or GMT? With local time you end up
changing it twice a year, but this is conventional practice with IBM PCs.
GMT allows the clock chip to be set and only adjust for drift over time
and the Unix timezone handling will handle DST correctly.

The config for ntpd would be /etc/ntp.conf. Timezone is /etc/ something,
`apropos timezone` should point to the correct man page.

I created a folder on the working hard drive...how was I supposed to know?
I will start to understand some of this someday...I hope.
She suggested it...I just didn't understand what she said...I had to ask
the fellow that got me started on Linux in the first place...he just
happened to contact me tonight...
He said you are thinking about this all wrong...need I say more?

   Thank you, Russell. I saw the reference in the tee man page. While I've
known of tee for years I've not tried it before yesterday. Such a simple
command, but I just could not get it to work. After all, if it's supposed to
copy what goes to stdout to the named file, there should be no need for
explicit redirection on the command line. No?

Except that programs often send warnings and informational messages to 
stderr, not stdout. 'tee' won't capture stderr unless it's redirected to 
stdout.

David,

   I tried that, too. by using 2>&1 on the command line. Now, I did not try it
at the end of the line (after the tee), so I don't know if that's the issue.
Whether I used the redirection did not affect what was in the file: only 322
bytes, the last line.

Bill,

   Thank you very much. Russell's suggestion of using script is another
realistic approach. Regardless, it does not answer my initial question: why
'tee' didn't work in my various trial-and-error permutations of the command
line, and where there's better documentation for the tool than the man page.

Does Linux require fstab entries to mount a volume?  Forgive me, but I'm 
a BSD guy.  My experience w/ Linux to date hasn't put me in this type of 
situation.  I find it odd though if you can't mount and specify the 
device all on one line, thus eliminating the need to edit and re-edit files.

Right.

tee is a great tool, Rich, it's a good one to learn. It's very handy at 
times to be able to see stdout and also grab it to a file and tee makes 
that very easy.

One question, as you're troubleshooting, is whether tee is even broken. 
It may be working as designed, or there may be something else broken in 
your environment.

One interesting comparison would be to run the command and send stdout 
and stderr out to a file without using tee, then compare and see if you 
get a different result when you use tee. You could do it to two 
different output filenames and diff them.

I don't generally redirect stderr when I use tee so I'm not positive of 
the syntax. I just use tee as a quick and dirty way to grab stdout while 
I watch it. As with most *nix things, there are a lot of different ways 
to do all of this :)

I did see this page, which you may have already seen:

Pardon for replying without reading the entire thread, but thought
this may be relevant:

When you're expecting some set output handling to work, sometimes it
doesn't occur the way it "should".  One recent example, redirecting
STDERR/STDOUT from SLES9's rsync is improper for some reason.  You can
correctly redirect 1> 2> when running it in 'normal' or debug, but the
verbose mode doesn't work... comes out properly to the command line,
but when you do 2> /tmp/test.txt your stderr never gets there (or to
console).

Sometimes when you're just starting to think you're crazy, it really
IS something behaving erraticly :)

It is possible for programs to discover and open the controlling tty to
which they are connected, bypassing the standard I/O conventions.

I'm using Postfix with no hashes to rebuild.  I'm using PostgreSQL for the 
configuration that would normally go in hashes in Postfix.  This works very well 
because you can change them remotely via whatever tools you like to work on your 
database with, i.e. pgAdmin.  I'm using teapop over stunnel4 for the pop3 and it 
is also configured via the database.  Life is good.  I've Postfix for about 7 
years in commercial and private environments.  It is exceptional, indeed, "State 
of the Art".

NO... 

You only <me any way> put stuff in fstab if you are going to keep it.

To mount one time..

You are right..  Do it from the command line..

Did you not use /etc/fstab in you BSD life?

How about a little experimentation?

ls | tee dircontents
more dircontents

Does that do what you expect?

Then how about:
 perl -e 'print STDERR "Error Message!\n"; print "Normal Message on STDOUT\n";' 2>&1 | tee teetest
 cat teetest

Sure, but not for one time mounts.   The parent said he wanted to copy 
some files. I suppose I assumed it was a quicky.  Maybe not.  Oh well, 
it's worth mentioning that editing fstab isn't required for a quick copy 
of a few files.

How does one structure a mount command that will do that?
My limited number of tries resulted in bash telling me that the volumes
didn't exist in fstab or mtab(?).

The /mnt/suse folder must exist first.

If I set my clock preferences to UTC, which is the only other choice I
have at this time, I am showing about 16 hours ago (i.e.  Noon today

I don't think that tee is the problem.  More likely it's the way in
which the shell redirects the streams.

For example, I know that `command 2>&1 1>/tmp/outfile` sends stderr to
the terminal and stdout to the file (instead of com

perl -e 'print STDERR "Error Message!\n"; print "Normal Message on
STDOUT\n";' 2>&1 1>/tmp/outfile

This may sound like a horrible kludge, but if all else fails try this:

  if [ 1 ]
  then 
    command 2>&1
  fi  | tee $outfile

   Thanks to everyone who commented and helped.

   I just tested 'tee' on a couple of activities, and it worked just fine. For
whatever reason, there must have been something about the make that kept the
output from being copied to the file. The fist thing I tried was, 'make
<name> | build_error.log' and that should have worked.

   Oh, well. Another computer moment.

Humph.  I was thinking of redirecting to a file, not piping.

Rich, does redirecting to a file like this work?

I think

root at root# mount   -t reiserfs /dev/hdb1 /mnt/suse_10

works better...

And /mnt/suse_10  must exist first

Jason,

   No, it didn't for some reason. Even trying to capture stdout just caused
the process to hang.

  MRTG uses Toby Oetiker's wonderful RRDtool to store and graph the
data.  The RRDGraph utility automatically scales the Y-Axis to match
the greatest value in the selected time period.

  This can behavior can be overridden by setting a maximum value for
the Y-Axis or change to a logarithmic scale.  It may be easier to
simply graph the data on separate graphs.

That would explain why the OS told me it was either an unknown file system
or hdb1 didn't exist in the fstab or mtab.  It took a while to figure
out where to put the appropriate directory (or folder) to mount...

My previous posting ( and all your great answers ) has helped but it has 
come down to needing to run a 2.4 kernel.  The issue is some fuzzy 
suggestions got us installing FC4.  Now the word is we need to go to a 
2.4 kernel.

Some google.com searching kept going in circles and arriving at the same 
place.  We're looking at building a kernel from source but there are 
warnings about SELinux and udev breaking.

Any suggestions on getting a 2.4 kernel without re-installing?

Why do you need to go to a 2.4 kernel?  If you do actually have a need to 
do that, then FC4 is probably not the distro for you.  I am not certain 
how would do it.  

You might look at the Redhat Enterprise version. It might have a version 
that relys on the old kernel.

I decided on Slackware since it seems to me to be the only major
distro left that uses 2.4.

Being that Ubuntu is based on debian you might try the following

Replace ntp.ubuntulinux.org with

server pool.ntp.org

in the ntp.conf file

then, apt-get install ntpdate, this will update your hardware clock
appropriately

After it's started then /etc/init.d/ntp-server restart

wait a few minutes then see if it's working with a

ntpq -p

Yeah CentOS 3.x does but getting there is a bit of an issue.  We'd 
prefer to _not_ re-install.

Hmm, I'm guessing wildly that your timezone isn't set, and your hardware
clock may or may not be set right. Does this system ever run any other
OS? Do you care what that OS's view of the clock looks like?

First step, as root run `tzconfig`. This is simply a front-end to adjust
the /etc/localtime symbolic link as appropriate.

Next step, use `date` to set the system clock (the kernel's view of the
clock, not the actual battery-backed up hardware clock). This gets
filtered through the timezone setting, so this has to be done second.

Final step, use `hwclock` to adjust the hardware clock if needed, and
then set the system to restore it correctly. I'm unsure whether the
location is universal, but on Debian /etc/default/rcS has the variable
"UTC" that controls whether your hardware clock gets set to UTC versus
local time. If you only ever run Linux on your system, you definitely
want to set that to "yes", as the timezone adjusts what every program
displays and you don't have to deal with modifying the hardware clock.

NTP servers will typically give you more precise time, which is why the
default is to have `hwclock` store the adjusted time to the hardware
clock on shutdown.

Yuck.  Scsi is a pain.

I would set up a test machine and then try building a 2.4 kernel from
the src rpm.  Then try installing that kernel on the test machine and
see if it boots.  (You have to recompile to get the gcc versions to
match.)

I have no idea if it will work, but it is worth a try.

Here is the response from the machine after changing the ntp server and stopping
and restarting ntp-server.

If I read this right I am set to local time.  I will do some more

But I really could use an app that had the structured drawing

Check out http://www.thekompany.com/products/kivio/

kivio may also be included in some later versions of kde.  (Not
certain.)  Looks like a good visio replacement.  I don't know if it will
read the visio file format.  It would be nice, but...

Dia is also available, but may be too primitive for your needs.

   Dia.

   If that's not to your liking, there are about 18 other 2D drawing
applications among which to choose. Some are sketch, ipe, tgif, xfig,
jpicedt, and gri.

Thanks for the suggestions. I've tried Dia before. Its drawing tools 
are fine for my needs, but I need better text handling. In Dia you 
can't even flow text, nor can you apply different attributes to 
different words, e.g., making one word italic. Extremely 
rudimentary. Reminds me of "artistic text" in CorelDRAW 1.0.

Others suggested Kivio, and I already found it and want to try it. 
Unfortunately, while it is listed in Synaptic and it installs fine, it 
won't run. If I launch it from the Applications menu, nothing 
happens. I understand enough about Linux now to know that if I 
launch it from the command line sometimes it gives error 
messages. Doing so gives me:

kbuildsycoca running ...
Reusing existing ksycoca
Kbuildsycoca: ERROR creating database'/var/tmp/kdecache
    -jjj/ksycoca'
Kbuildsycoca: Wrong permissions on directory? Disk full?
koffice (lib kofficecore): ERROR Couldn't find the native MimeType 
   in kivio's
desktop file. Check your installation !

I asked in Ubuntu-64 forum yesterday, but no replies. Perhaps I 
can find somewhere else to ask, but at the moment I am stumped.

I also have Inkscape installed and running, but again, its text 
handling is too rudimentary. Usually I need to type a page or two of 
text (as in a word processor) followed by several pages of 
diagrams. I've never tried Visio, but everyone tells me it's just what I 
need. 

Right now I'm using OpenOffice.org Writer, but its drawing 
capabilities are too limiting. Actually, most of the time all I need 
are lines, but they must always be of various uniform lengths and 
directions. Even after turning on the grid function in Writer it is 
difficult to get them positioned correctly. Plus, it's cumbersome to 
zoom in and out, which on a laptop is constant and essential.

Now I'm going to try ipe, tgif, xfig, jpicedit and gri. Maybe one of 
them will work.

Ick. What I meant to say was, "it spares the user a minor amount of
effort by not requiring them to specify the device and file system
type each time they want to mount a volume." Or something like that.

This distro probably isn't well-known, at least
locally. I downloaded 2.0 "Trinity" yesterday and
tried it out. I selected "Everything" during the
install, less than two full CD's (i386). It's an
RPM-based distro.

The server-type applications work fine. There is a
total absence of multimedia applications--I can't even
tell if the sound card works, although it is
recognized. The module is loaded for the Brooktree TV
card, but "TV Time" can't find it. Also there is no
office suite.

Presumably this will not make it to the desktop, since
even the most modest of other distros (except Damn
Small, perhaps), support many of the omitted
applications out of the box.

Tried the above suggestions:

1) Sketch installed, but did not make an entry in the Applications 
launch menu. I tried to run it from the command line with "sketch." 
This produced several lines of options I am supposed to use, not 
one of which I could understand. There is no man page and, of 
course, no help file. I uninstalled it.

2) Ipe installed fine and ran OK, although I had to launch it from the 
command line. But text handling is pathetic. You can't even select 
the font. Uninstalled it.

3) Tgif ran OK, but again I had to launch it from the command line. 
Text handling is better, but it sees only six fonts. Evidently it does 
not see what is installed in the system. And for point size you get 
your choice of "tiny," "large," etc. Uninstalled it.

4) After reading about xfig I decided it was not what I need, so I 
skipped it.

5) Jpicedit is not listed in Synaptic. Must mean it won't run on a 64-
bit system. I could probably install it in Chroot, but unless I hear 
great things about it, I'll pass.

6) Also skipped gri. Evidently it is only command line, which 
means it is not usable for my purposes.

However, I looked through Synaptic under the Graphics tab and 
found one more that looked promising -- Cenon. I installed it, but 
can't get it to run. It did not install a launch link in the Applications 
menu and when I type "cenon" at the command line it says 
"command not found." The actual app name is cenon.app, but that 
also gives "command not found." I went to the home page and read 
the FAQ, but didn't find any explanation. However, there were 
screenshots showing that it might well be what I need. Synaptic 
says it is installed. Now all I need to do is figure out how to launch 
it.

Otherwise it looks like it's either kivio (which I still can't get to run), 
stick with OpenOffice.org, or wait until next year when Scribus 
matures some more.

Have you tried oodraw?  I'm guessing that the writer interface is where 
most of the limitation comes from.

IIRC, there is a way to embed external sxd files in your text document.

   You must have used a different application than the ipe that I use. All
text is handled as LaTeX and the output is typeset. It's at the opposite
extreme from "pathetic." The native file format is PSTricks.

   Yeah. A lot of *nix are that way. Once I'm sure the path to the executable
is OK I make a new entry for it on an Xfce menu and off it goes.

   It's a java app that uses LaTeX and produces .pdf files directly.

   It's a plotting/graphing language. By default you enter commands in a
terminal window, then run the program.

   I suppose that a general drawing program is more suited to you than is a
scientific plotting application, a graphics language, or typeset text on the
figure.

Would something like Inkscape work for what you're trying to do?

One of the other things I pointed out below, is to

apt-get install ntpdate

This is a separate program from ntp-server.  It's purpose is to query
the servers listed in your /etc/ntp.conf file and update your hardware
clock to the correct time.  Then ntp-server will start after that and
fine tune this value over time.

Install that and I think your ntpq -p results will change.

Well, there are a number of options for tomorrow night.

I have someone who has offered to speak, but it is on medical tech, not 
computer tech.

I have another person who has offered to speak, but has yet to get back to 
me to confirm that he will.

The other options are doing a "round table discussion" again or I can give 
my talk on "Copyright and Patent Violation" or we can sit and watch 
episodes of Doctor Who from the 2005 season or something else.

Ideas? Comments? Suggestions?

Your IP address is 73.78.73.84?

You're trying to synchronize to blade.avnf.com, but so far you haven't
been able to get any response from it. This is indicated by the 16 in the
"st"ratum column (stratum 1 is you've got a GPS or other authoritative
timekeeping device directly connected). "Reach" of 0 explicitly states
your system has been unable to connect. Likely need to restart ntpd to
try another NTP server, possibly blade.avnf.com is overloaded.

If you see a line with a <5 stratum >0 reach then that says your system
is successfully talking to the NTP server. Once you're connecting if
offset is above 10, then your clock is likely set wrong. A space in the
first column means your system isn't synchronized to that server, a plus
means you're connecting and the server passes the sanity checks, and a
star means your system is synchronizing with that server.

I've had Inkscape installed just about ever since I started using 
Linux last summer. It's really nice, but designed for just single-
image files, like Illustrator. I need to do documents that might get 
to 20-30 pages or more, with diagrams interspersed in the text. The 
diagrams are all simple, but they need to have a certain uniformity 
to them. 

Furthermore, even if I tried to use Inkscape to create the drawings, 
it uses SVG file format, which nothing else seems to be able to 
use (not OO.o). I can't even copy and paste from it into anything 
else that I might be able to use for the text.

What I really need is a simple vector drawing app that has 
excellent text capabilities, and is a GUI. OpenOffice.org comes the 
closest, but it takes me a long time to position the graphics. The 
problem is that I am using it as I work on projects in linguistics. 
This means that I make a lot of mistakes and need to redo the 
drawing after I figure out where I went wrong. Each time I need to 
do that I have rebuild just about the entire page. Moreover, the final 
results are not as good as I'd like, because it's really hard to line 
up the diagrams with the text, both horizontally and vertically. 
Others in my classes have suggested Visio, which is why I started 
out asking for a Visio clone for Linux. Visio is really designed for 
flow charts, which is very similar to what I need to do.

Maybe I should have asked for a flow chart application. :(

You can run Visio on Linux using XCrossover Office, I think it's called.
I've done that, and it works pretty well.  Another app' that might suit your
needs is PageMaker (used for typesetting), but I'm not sure that works on
Linux at all.  There aren't many (any?) native Linux app's that really do
this sort of work.

If you actually have a copy of visio and would just prefer to use it
under linux, you could just get Crossover Office from
http://www.codeweavers.com/.

I believe it works with Crossover office. The current Pagemaker-like 
product from Adobe is called inDesign. Crossover Office also supports 
Framemaker.

Yes, I already knew that Crossover Office would run Visio. I can 
even get the Pro version of Crossover Office for $56 academic price 
via download, although I'd also have to spring for a copy of Visio 
(ugh). I'd much rather not spend even the $56, plus I am trying to 
be as much a purist as I can. OK, I'm not particularly pure in any of 
the other aspects of my life, so I don't know why I want to be a 
Linux purist, but I do. Maybe because it's my only hope of ever 
being pure at anything. :)

And Crossover Office will also run InDesign 2.0, although not CS or 
CS2. Not sure about PageMaker, but who cares if it will run 
InDesign. Even InDesign 2.0 can run the pants off of any other 
layout app. However, I am pinning my hopes on Scribus in the 
page layout department. 

I spent some time today and finally got Kivio to launch. It did not 
install a launch item in the Gnome Applications menu, so I tried to 
run it from the command line. Kept getting errors and it wouldn't 
launch. After much googling I found a reference that suggested it 
was a permissions thing. Sure enough, "sudo kivio" did the trick. I'll 
figure out later how to fix it.

At least I got it running so I could explore it. And that is where I 
became disappointed. It handles text reasonably well as to the 
characters, but there is no paragraph formatting. Not even tabs. No 
indents either. How can I use a tool like that to write a report?

On the plus side, it has a customizable grid that should make 
object and text placement a piece of cake. However, there is 
another problem. All the "objects" you place on the page are called 
"templates" (yes, a template is a single object, e.g., a square box 
that you might enter text into like "CEO" or something flow-charty). 
Now, Kivio comes with 30-40 sets of templates, grouped according 
to typical usage. For example, one is called "Circuits" and has all 
those cool electrical diagrams (switch, transformer, earth, etc.). 

All that is very nice, but none of the existing ones are even close to 
suitable for me. "No problem," I thought. "I'll just create my own set 
of templates." Hah! Not so fast kiddo! The proggers left out the 
abillity to create your own set of templates. You can't even create a 
template and add it to an existing set.

I find that unbelievably limiting. So unbelievable that before giving 
up on it I'm going to find a Kivio forum somewhere and ask. After 
all, maybe in my haste I missed the button for "create template 
set." But at this point, it looks like I'm stuck with OO.o. Either that 
or abandon Linux for my linguistics work and just do everything on 
my Windows 2000 computer. That would suck.

Maybe I'm missing something here, but have you considered writing your
report with a word processor, creating your diagrams with a drawing
program, and embedding the drawings in your word processor document? 
I'm afraid I don't see how you can hold paragraph formatting against a
drawing program.

I  used CORBA at a startup company I was working at a couple of years ago. We 
were trying to put together a demo system using a free SIP stack and the only 
one we could find was written in Java. We had to also get our system up on an 
SS7 network and the API to interface with the SS7 stack was C-based. We used 
CORBA for IPC between the Jave and C++ processes on our demo system. We used 
a free ORB called omniORB which supported C++ bindings. 

I'm not sure my story really tells what the status of CORBA is other than 
there are some pretty decent free ORBs out there and all the developers that 
worked in our system liked using CORBA as it made doing IPC in our system 
fairly easy.

Another project I worked on in the late 1990s used pure Java code with a 
Java-based ORB. WE used CORBA to allow a Swing-based client to comminucate 
with Java-based services that accessed an Oracle database on a Unix back-end.

HTH,

Tony

Sean,

I forgot to mention that I did install ntpdate before stopping and
restarting as you suggested.  According to Elliot I still have problems.
I must admit that I am not following some of the things you folks tell
me as well as I would like.
I am still trying though.  More to follow in reply to Elliot.

I am not sure where those numbers come from showing my IP address.  When
I do an ifconfig eth0 those numbers are not present in the reply.
Restarting ntpd doesn't seem to make any difference.  The latest reply

My brain does not function well with non-human languages. Good 
thing there are things to do with your life other than being a 
programmer. So how advanced will this presentation be? What if 
you have given TeX, Latex and Lyx several days in all, and

I am interested in this topic, but I am not able to attend the meeting

Yes, I certainly have considered that. The problem is positioning 
the graphics. In a word processor you have to "anchor" the graphic 
to something. Your choices are "page," "paragraph," "character," 
or "as a character." (In OO.o, anyway -- I abandoned Word a long 
time ago.)

If I anchor to page, then the graphic does not move if I later add or 
delete text. If I anchor to paragraph, character or as a character it 
moves with the text, but for some reason the graphic does not stay 
a uniform distance from the text. For example, suppose I need to 
show a mother-daughter branching-dependency issue by creating a 
simple two-line graphic that looks like this: /\. No matter how I 
tweak the line leading I can't get a uniform distance between the 
top and the bottom points and the text. I always end up with the 
top or the bottom sticking into the text or too far away from it.

Similarly, I can't get a uniform distance horizontally. If I need to 
create a three-way branching (like this /|\) I can't get the center bar 
to hit the top point of the triangle because I have to move it with the

I bet that comes out looking horrible on everyone's e-mail client. 
Assume that I need to adjust the width of each item so the text on 
the bottom of each point does not encroach on the space of other 
text items. Lines can be of varying degrees. Triangles do not need 
to be isoceles (each side of different degrees) and should be 
formed to make the structure easy to follow. This is a really simple 
diagram. Sometimes the diagrams span more than one page. 
There are other elements that are sometimes necessary, such as 
where I need to demonstrate (in English) wh-movement, do-
insertion, and a zillion other bizarre features of English, one of the 
biggest train wrecks of the world's languages.

I am currently using OO.o Writer with its drawing toolbar available. I 
have the grid feature turned on, which helps with getting the points 
properly positioned. I am anchoring everything as a character. But 
it is still time-consuming and the results, while sufficient to hand in 
to a professor, are not accurate enough for publishing standards.

Add the fact that I frequently need to use lots of IPA characters in 
the text, so I am limited to Unicode fonts.

Right now I am just dealing with English syntax. Later when I get 
into syntactic diagrams for a language like Proto-Matumbi (a 
reconstructed archaic form from which the Matumbi group [Guthrie 
P.10] evolved), things will get even hairier.

So far, the best tool is Adobe InDesign CS. But you can't run that 
in Linux, not even with Crossover Office. I am hoping that Scribus 
will mature to the point where it will be adequate, but that will be 
another year at least. In the meantime, it seems to me that a flow-
chart type program might be a good alternative.

John,

   Two comments:

   1.) A smart page layout/typesetting application will adjust the position of
a figure or table based on typographic conventions. Go with the flow instead
of fighting it. If you put a cross-reference in the text, and a label on the
figure or table, then readers can find the appropriate reference easily
enough.

   Your extensive descriptions and anguish over exact placements,
requirements, and so on makes it appear to us naive folks that tweaking
details is more important to you than focusing on content and effective
communications to your reader(s).

   2.) Take 30 minutes to do the LyX tutorial (1.3.7 was just released).
You'll be immediately productive. Do your figures in whatever application you
want, save (or convert them) to .eps or .pdf, then use Insert->Float->Figures
to place them in the text. Let TeX find the best spot for them. You can add a
label in front of the caption and place a cross-reference in the text.

   The benefits are that you focus on the content and end up with beautifully
typeset output. The downside is that you spend a bit of time learning it. LyX
has the shortest learning curve of any application I've used. Once you get
into it, you'll learn LaTeX as you need it to do specific things.

Subject: [PLUG] Emacs: switching focus among buffers
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0601181102220.4513@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My Emacs quick reference card does not provide any keyboard approach to
switching among buffers. If I use c-x c-b to get a list of available buffers
I still need to move to a different one, press [Enter], then c-x 1 to have
that buffer fully available for editing. Or, I can select 'Buffer' from the
menu with the trackball, then click on the one I want.

   Is there no ctrl or meta key combination that pages through buffers?

John:

. Here's an alternative "remotely like Visio".
. Freegeek embeds GraphViz code into their MediaWiki enabled site.
. A PNG file is then generated & displayed to visitors.
. For elaborate code examples click on a PNG file at GraphViz.Org.
. Search for "graph" at Wiki.Freegeek.Org to view Freegeek examples.
. Here's an example of text & code "together" on a Freegeek Wiki page:
  http://wiki.freegeek.org/index.php/Power_Supply_Sorting
. I pasted the code for this graph below.
. A mix of HTML tables & GraphViz code may provide you w/enough control.
. Or perhaps GraphViz is embedded into a GUI type product.

For page layouts also look at "Scribus".  It is meant as a Pagemaker 
replacement.  It might have the alignment tools needed.

I was looking at some articles on "Carrier Grade Linux", and wondering if 
anyone has rolled-their-own super-duper high-speed router or other networking 
widget? Is there bare hardware available somewheres, so you can cobble up 
your own homegrown equivalent to a high-end Cisco router, for example?

Or, has anyone taken a commercial gadget like Cisco, maybe got a great deal on 
Ebay, and put Linux on it?

C-x b (switch-to-buffer) then treat it like typical filename completion.
Hitting tab will complete as far as possible.  A second tab will show
the possible completions in a temporary buffer.

It is builtin.  The command is other-window.  It switches to the other
window (half) when the screen is split.

There is also next-buffer (C-x <right> and C-x C-<right>) and
prev-buffer (C-x <left> and C-x C-<left>) which switch to the next and
next buffers in the current window.

I don't know about those last two since I use a mode called iswitchb. 
With C-x b, it lists the buffers in the minibuffer and allows
selecting them by typing incremental search or paging through the list
with C-s and C-r.

Ian,

   Ah, yes! Thanks. I prefer to have one buffer per screen unless I'm doing a
lot of copying from one file to another.

   Nah. They don't do anything for me, either.

   OK. I'll continue using the pointy thing to select buffers from the menu. I
was just curious about a keyboard shortcut since most of emacs can be run
that way.

   Thanks, Ian and Terry,

Unfortunately, you'll never get close to cisco-grade. Linux PCs don't have
TCAMs, and it's simply impossible to forward and lookup stuff in software
in the same amount of time that hardware can do it.

Juniper routers use JunOS, which is based on FreeBSD.. but that's not
really used for forwarding, it's still all in hardware.

Check out Nexcom's cute li'l 1U router boxes.  They even have CF slots
so you can run the thing entirely out of flash.  (see: Limey Linux)

Yup.  For the 2500 series, at least.

Yes, I'm just trying to figure out if there is a reasonable home-grown 
alternative to the snooty elite commercial boxes, because as you said x86 
doesn't have the same capabilities.

It's not defined in my ~/.emacs. It's a default key assignment in
GNU Emacs as far as I know.

Doing a "c-h k" on "c-x o" says that the associated function is
"other-window".

Router vendors like Tasman, Cisco (Under the Linksys brand) all use 
linux in some of their products.... But not usually the High end stuff.

Juniper uses a BSD variant for the Control Plane software of their 
routers.

Cisco uses a QNX derived OS for its CRS system.

One company that does use Linux in an embedded capacity is F5,  it runs 
interrupt free and offers great throughput for Loadbalancing 
applications.

Max

Have you tried LyX?  It is a graphical front-end (sort of) for LaTeX.

>Not that I've totally given up on it. Maybe someday. Like after TeX
>becomes an integrated one-application GUI like InDesign. 

OK, it isn't quite that.  It isn't immediate graphical feedback.  It 
does provide a layer of insulation from LaTeX  though.  It isn't going 
to give you per-pixel control over every page, but it will 
automatically renumber all of your sections and chapters when you add 
one in the middle.  Great for mathematical formulas, especially if you 
learn the hotkeys.

As graphics go, you'll need to create those in an external program and 
embed them (eps is good for scalable graphics, don't think it does svg 
yet.)

Maybe LyX isn't what you're looking for, but it certainly is a different 
beast than TeX.   Judging from all of your requirements, I really don't 
think Visio is what you're looking for either.

Maybe you can do something for the scribus project that will help it 
mature sooner.

Indeed.  After reading this thread, I don't think software exists that's
going to do exactly what John wants.

I think a graphical front end to LaTeX would come closest if he would
take the time to learn it and honestly give it a chance.  People who sit
back and don't try something suggested to them because they *think* it
will be too hard just PISS ME OFF.  Seriously.

John, you're going to have to make some concessions here.  There are two
things at stake, I think:  You want diagrams and paragraphs, and you
want them laid out *exactly* in the pixels you think they should be laid
out in.

You can make the diagrams now, correct?

You can make the paragraphs.

What you need now is to bring them together.  Export the diagrams as
graphics to be imported in to your word processor.  Now, what are you
going to use for a word processor?  You have two real choices here... a
lazy word processor like OpenOffice or something more advanced that
really allows you the complicated formatting you want like a LaTeX
front-end.  Pick one, please.

I don't think an intermediate ground exists.

Thank you and have a nice day!

Rob

And another thing... I really *really* don't appreciate people being
rude to Rich.  I have never seen Rich's responses even begin to approach
rudeness.  Ever.  I don't know anybody who is as consistently good
natured as Rich is here.  Be polite to my friends and I shall be polite
to you.

If you wish to make it clear to Rich you aren't interested in a
LaTeX-based solution, there are far more polite and civil ways to act.

My apologies to the rest of the list for my offtopicality.  Ha.  I made
a new word.  This will be my last post in the thread...

The last time I managed a BIG-IP system it run FreeBSD; in '99 I used

OK, but what I'm trying to find out is if high-end bare hardware is available, 
equivalent to a high-end Cisco router, with TCAM and multiple buses and CPUs 
and all that good stuff, and will Linux run on it. The goal is to save money 
and have more flexibility than with prefab commercial box.

I would be surprised if someone somewheres hasn't hacked Linux onto a 
commercial device, because there is a large second-hand market, but so far I 
haven't found it. 

I've been talking to various hardware vendors, and so far haven't found 
anything but expensive prefab devices, with licenses and all those horrid 
things. You can cobble up nearly anything from Linux and affordable hardware- 
does the same option exist at the top end?

Perhaps you could give us an idea of what sort of bandwidth and features
you need?  "High-end" could mean a number of things.  For example, if what
you needed was a router to handle lots of connections but not 10Gb routing,
an IBM pSeries can run Linux and has expandible PCI bus units to accomodate,
say, ~24 ports (maybe more).  (Of course, given the cost of a pSeries and
Ethernet cards, a high-end router might cost less.)  I have never seen any
x86-based systems with multiple PCI buses and secondary bus enclosures,
but I wouldn't be surprised if they existed.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu-64, Chroot, PSU and NoCat
Message-ID: <43CF6B1C.24527.7F776EBB@localhost>

I hope there's someone here familiar with Odin 
login issues because I have a real stumper. 
Except this time at least I know the cause of 
the problem. I just don't know the cure.

I have been using Ubuntu-64 on my laptop since 
last summer, and upgraded from Hoary to Breezy 
when Breezy came out. In all that time I had 
been trying to get a few things working that 
simply refused to run or install in 64-bit 
Linux, e.g., RealPlayer, Adobe Reader 7.0 and 
Flash. So last week I finally decided it was 
time to bite the bullet and learn how to do 
chroot. Amazingly, I actually managed to do it 
from instructions on an Ubuntu wiki. Not only 
did I get chroot working fine, I managed to 
install Adobe Reader 7.0 and RealPlayer using 
Synaptic32. Both ran fine as standalone apps, 
but I couldn't get them "plugged into" Firefox. 
So, after struggling with that issue for a while 
I decided "to hell with it, I'll just install 32-
bit Firefox in chroot also." 

Having done so I actually got Flash and 
RealPlayer working now in 32-bit Firefox. (Still 
haven't got a PDF viewer working in 32-bit 
Firefox, but I'll work on that later.) I also 
imported all my bookmarks from the old version 
of Firefox. This worked so well that I went into 
the Gnome Applications menu and changed the 
Properties for the Firefox launch item from 
"firefox %u" to "dchroot -d firefox %u." See, 
I've actually learned how to do some command 
line things in Linux!

So yesterday I went to PSU with my computer for 
the first time since doing this. I booted it up, 
launched Firefox, and clicked to go to my PSU 
webmail account, expecting NoCat to pop up and 
ask for me to log in. But NoCat would not 
appear. OK, that happens sometimes. Poor NoCat 
must be a really busy dude, 'cause sometimes I 
have to knock repeatedly to get him to notice 
me. But after 15 minutes of trying I decided 
something must be wrong. I was just upstairs in 
Smith, so I decided to go to the basement and 
talk with the nice computer people. We tried 
over and over, but absolutely could not get 
NoCat to pop up. The Help person did verify that 
the wifi was working, I had the right IP 
numbers, the wifi light on the corner of the 
computer was lit up, and everything should be 
working. After 15 minutes of trying everything 
she could think of we decided to do the Windows 
ultimate trick -- reboot.

So I shut down and restarted. I have Ubuntu set 
to give me a verbose list of what it's doing 
during the boot. As I was watching it suddenly 
the new lines about chroot scrolled by. And then 
it hit me. The only thing that was different was 
that I was using a new 32-bit version of 
Firefox. 

So after it finished booting and I was logged 
in, and verified that Firefox still wouldn't 
work, I opened a terminal and typed just 
"firefox" in order to bring up the old version 
of Firefox (luckily I didn't uninstall it). And 
when it came up I tried my webmail account and 
sure enough! NoCat popped right up and I was in.

So I know the problem is in the 32-bit Firefox. 
The 32-bit Firefox has no problem going out to 
the net at home through my ethernet to the 
router and cable modem. It's just NoCat that it 
isn't talking nice to. Except I haven't tried 
the wifi anyplace else, so there might be a 
problem with 32-bit Firefox and the wifi in 
general.

OK, that's the problem. Any PSUers out there 
have any idea what is wrong?

Subject: [PLUG] Carrier Grade Linux (CGL) - Standards Group
Message-ID: <43CFCF24.2090009@f2it.com>

Hi there,

     Carrier Grade Linux (CGL) is a set of technical specifications for 
implementing a Linux based platform for telecommunications.  The group 
gathers requirements from industry and other interested people, then 
publishes the standards.  Many of these requirements have broader appeal 
(like high resolution timers), but they happened to be specified by this 
telco-centric group.   The implementation of these recommendations is up 
to the Linux distributors and other integrators.   So there is the 
specification, and the products that use it.  SuSE, RedHat, Montavista 
and others, all have 1)claimed to support these features  2) marketed 
"CGL" complaint versions.

    When the group was started, our overall goal was to make it easier 
for telecom integrators to use Linux in products.  Also, we had basic 
goals around promoting Linux in the telecom industry.   From my personal 
experience, its been a fantastic success!  When I did marketing and 
sales at IBM, we went from educating our customers about Linux, to 
helping them build and deploy products on Linux/BladeCenter.  All in 
less than three years!    Look at some of the public press about Linux 
from Cisco, Lucent, Nokia, Nortel... these guys love Linux now.  

    The home for the standards group is at our vary own local Open 
Source Development Labs (Linus' current employer):

Everytime I fire up firefox and plug about:plugins to the browser it
only shows the default libnull plugin.

Anybody have a clue stick for me?  And sorry about the line wrapping above.

Try making a soft link from to libjavaplugin_oji.so 
from /home/user/.mozilla/plugins/libjavaplugin_oji.so. 

It must be a link- don't copy the file.

OK, here is the coherent version:

carla at windbag:~/.mozilla/plugins$ ls -al
libjavaplugin_oji.so 
-> /usr/lib/j2se/1.4/jre/plugin/i386/mozilla/libjavaplugin_oji.so

Nope same behaviour.   ~/.mozilla/plugins didn't exist and had to mkdir
the plugins directory and did the link as you suggested.

Try 'ldd plug-in-file' and see if you've got any unresolved symbols.

No unresolved symbols.  FWIW I did the soft link with ver 1.0.7 of

firefox?  So far, I haven't found one.

Not that I know of... but are you looking at stdout and stderr?

Fire up Firefox from a console...

It's linux now, at least with the Big IP version 9 stuff that they've been

In fact that is how I've been starting firefox. A surprising dearth of

Nothing at all is appearing about Java?

Whenever I had missing symbols, or the wrong java plugin version
installed, or a java plugin that caused seg faults, I figured it out as
those errors appeared at the console...

I wonder if your Firefox packager disabled 'em?

Some time back there was a discussion about an HP all-in-one.  I believe
it was about the 2610xi.  The general drift was about the lack of
support for these machines.
The person who asked the question was going to try the drivers for a
2600...my question...
Did you have any luck making the 2610 work?
I have one and would like to have it work under Ubuntu or perhaps add it
to the network.  Either way it needs to be Linux usable.

  Forgot to mention. My experience with the HP PSC2510, works well as a 
printer when on a tcp/ip network, but can't scan. IIRC, Linux could use the 
scanner only if it was connected via USB. In my case, I use a windoze system 
on the network for scanning.

We've got an HP 3020 sitting behind a Jetdirect 175x. Scanning is 
available via a simple web interface; no local drivers are needed. 
Once the scan is complete, the resulting image is e-mailed to your 
inbox.

Of course, a Jetdirect appliance isn't cheap (ca. $150), and I don't 
know if the 175x will work with that Photosmart model, but it's a 
useful solution in some environments.

Anyone shopping for a new printer, check out HP's Linux page:
http://h10018.www1.hp.com/wwsolutions/linux/products/printing_imaging/index.html

They actually blatantly list which of their products come with actual Linux 
drivers, which includes a number of inkjet and multi-function printers. I 
darn near fainted at the sight.

Samsung's Linux support is very good, and their machines are good quality. 
Better than HP, I think.

Message-ID: <012120060008.20357.43D17B8A0001DA8E00004F852200750784069802080106@comcast.net>

Lately I have been using Firefox that I installed in chroot on my
Ubuntu-64 Breezy laptop. It works fine from home where I have Comcast
cable and ethernet. But away from home I need wifi and nothing installed
in the chroot environment can see the wifi. 

I installed Firefox32 via Synaptic32 while at home. Later at the
university I tried to install Evolution into chroot via Synaptic32 in
order to determine if the problem with the wifi was in chroot or in
Firefox32. Well, even Synaptic32 couldn't get out over the wifi, so that
proves it right there. Nothing in chroot can see the wifi.

I should add that if I have System Monitor open when Firefox32 is trying
to get out, the network traffic display is flat-lined. 

I need some suggestions. I sure hope I don't have to install ndiswrapper
within the chroot environment, because it was a pain in the butt doing
it the first time in 64-bit. And besides, how could I have it running in
there if it is already running in the 64-bit world?

Maybe I could create some kind of a link that patches the 32-bit
environment to the 64-bit world?

Any suggestions at all are welcome.

I'm not exactly sure why you want to use Firefox in a chroot
environment so I might be commenting prematurely.  If it is for
security over the wifi connection, have you considered creating an SSH
tunnel back to a machine on your home network and then going through a
squid proxy?  This is super simple;

(on home machine)
sudo su
apt-get squid
echo "http_access allow all" >> /etc/squid/squid.conf
/etc/init.d/squid restart

(on wifi laptop)
ssh -f -N -L 3128:localhost:3128 firewall-ip-address
Set HTTP proxy in Firefox to http/localhost/3128

But, tell me why you want to use chroot firefox, and maybe my answer
will be better.

Because he has a 64-bit install and wants standard Mozilla plugins to work.

John, do you have /proc and /sys mounted in your chroot environment? 
I could see that potentially messing things up if they aren't.

OK, I posted that earlier e-mail from the university, but now I'm 
home. I just turned on the laptop and I noticed something in the 
boot sequence.

[Side question: Is there a secret key combination to pause the 
booting? I had to boot four times to copy down the following.]

As Ubuntu-64 Breezy boots it displays a ton of stuff before it gets 
to the graphical interface. I noticed the following and decided it 
might be significant, especially since it refers to /proc --

mount: special device /media/floppy0 does not exist
/home on /chroot/breezy/32bits/home type none (rw,bind)
/tmp on /chroot/breezy/32bits/tmp type none (rw,bind)
/dev on /chroot/breezy/32bits/dev type none (rw,bind)
/proc on /chroot/breezy/32bits/proc type none (rw,bind)
/media/cdrom0 on /chroot/breezy/32bits/media/cdrom0 type none 
(rw,bind)
/usr/share/fonts on /chroot/breezy/32bits/usr/share/fonts type none 
(rw,bind)
[FAIL] (in red)

I'm not sure if the lines starting with / are a continuation of the 
floppy line at the start, or if the [FAIL] at the end refers to just the 
fonts line or to all of the above. In other words, are all those lines 
things that are supposed to be mounted? And if so, did they? 
Beats me. :(

Note that the lines above following the floppy line were never there 
before installing chroot. But even I am smart enough to figure out 
that that makes sense.

Now, as to whether /proc and /sys mounted in chroot, I typed from 
a command line (guessing at the proper syntax):

dchroot -d mount

And got:

proc on /proc type proc (rw)
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw)

So my guess about the proper syntax was probably right. (Damn! 
I'm gettin' this stuff!) But I'm not sure exactly what the results mean.

Thanks for the suggestions so far. I hope the above gives you more 
to go on.

   Well, coherent Carla, this solved my problem of incompatible themes now
that I just upgraded from firefox-1.0.7 to -1.5. Thank you very much.

   I hope that you can help me solve this problem, too: when I start firefox
there's a message box that pops up telling me that I'm missing some chrome
thingie. I have no chrome on my system; that went out in the 1960s.

Any ideas?

Have you restarted all moz-related "things"? (firefox, thunderbird,
sunfire + anything that might use an embeded browser).  Perhaps there
is a dead ff process somewhere trying as hard as it can to make some
flash app exit, and it just isn't showing up on any desktops.

You can look in /var/log/messages :-)  In fact, depending on your
distribution, there might be a /var/log/boot.log or something like
that.  Whenever you're having trouble, get to know your log files in
/var/log.

Actually I'm not sure either, since you're in a chroot environment. 
An easy test though would be to run "ls <chroot prefix>/proc" and see
if there is anything in there.  It should be very similar to what is
in /proc in your 64-bit environment.

Okay, time to insult your intelligence, by asking if you can access
the internet from your wireless *outside* the chroot, i.e. with a
normal 64-bit app.

If so, then try to eliminate DNS issues, perhaps with just ping
(again, inside the chroot).  Try accessing an IP address.  If that
works but a hostname doesn't, check /etc/resolv.conf inside the
chroot.  There's more you could check after that if it still doesn't
work, but I'm getting too tired.

Personally, I still think you're playing with fire and life would be
much simpler if you just installed a 32-bit distribution.  But that's
your choice ;-)

Subject: [PLUG] Gordon Smith about to screw over consumers
Message-ID: <1137826951.22728.1.camel@zowie.fnordora.org>

If Gordon Smith is trying to pass himself off as being "on our side", it
is an act.

I just received this from the EFF.


* Action Alert: Hollywood Plants Its Flags in Our Homes

On Tuesday, January 24th, the Senate Commerce Committee will 
hold hearings on government regulation of digital media in 
the form of the broadcast flag and the audio flag. But even 
before the committee hears the arguments, Hollywood lobbyists 
have already planned the results. Drafts are being passed 
around Congress by Senator Gordon Smith (D-OR) of a "Digital 
Content Protection Act" that would make both flags laws at a 
stroke.

If this bill were to pass, government - and the entertainment 
industry - would control what you could do with digital media 
in your home. The broadcast flag would place TV shows in a 
DRM ghetto, where your right to copy, back-up, sell, time-
shift or convert them into formats convenient to you would be 
at the whim of the broadcasters. The audio flag would give 
the FCC matching powers over "digital audio broadcasting," 
including satellite radio, digital HD radio, and potentially 
even Internet radio. Fair use would be frozen into "customary 
historical use."

There's no benefit here for artists or customers, and for 
infringing copiers, evading these copy controls will be as 
easy as ever. No matter how inconvenienced individual users 
would be, pirates would be able to bypass it. The bill would 
usher in a new world of anti-consumer electronics and a 
chance for the MPAA's and RIAA's member companies to seize 
even greater control over all media distribution and use.

If you live in one of the states below, your senator is on 
the Senate Commerce Committee. Let him or her know that these 
flags would mark a new era of Hollywood's control of the home 
and of our digital networks.

You have a senator on the committee if you are a resident of 
Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Hawaii, 
Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Montana, 
Nebraska, Nevada, New, Hampshire, New, Jersey, North, Dakota, 
Oregon, South, Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington, or West 
Virginia.

Write to the Committee:
<http://action.eff.org/site/Advocacy?id=205>

If you're not in one of those states, it's still important 
for you to write to your senator and representative to 
support DMCA reform and take some of the bite out of these 
preposterous mandates.

Alan,

   Unless Smith had a sudden change of allegiance, he's still an R and not a
D. Of course, it sometimes is extremely difficult to distinguish between the
two.

   Regardless, please allow me to suggest that this topic is more appropriate
for the plug-talk list than for the hardware/software anguish list. This is
not to imply that the subject is not important or worthy of righteous
indignation, but it's not specifically oriented toward our favorite F/OSS.

   BTW, are you registered on the Groklaw blog site?
<http://www.groklaw.net/>. PJ has added a section devoted to DRM (sorta' a
funny name if you think about it closely: _who's_ digital rights are being
managed?). I highly recommend that site to all of you with interest in
following this issue, the mad-SCO diseases afflicting IBM, Novell, and
whoever else is left in play, and all the other affronts to reasonable
blood-pressure levels.

   There may also be some of you who are old enough to remember the novel (and
later, the movie) called "The Last Angry Man." It's worth re-reading.

Subject: [PLUG] Another Firefox-1.5 Quirk
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0601210711290.12626@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Cue the theme from "The Twilight Zone." The migration from Firefox-1.0.7 to
-1.5 seems complete (I have the preferred theme back now), but it doesn't
seem to like one particular Web site: cnn.com.

   While I can load all the other news sites I regularly peruse, each time I
try to see what CNN is pushing, the application shuts down. I ask it to load
http://www.cnn.com, and I watch the status bar as it tells me it's "waiting
for i.cnn.net." This refreshes about three times when ... SCHLOOP! ... no
more open browser. Instantly sucked into the twilight zone.

   It's not that I'm enamoured of CNN's particular take on the news, but I'm
concerned that the latest flavor of firefox behaves with less stability than
the prior versions. Has anyone else encountered sites that generate a process
infarction that kills firefox-1.5?

Nope.  But the few times that I've experienced odd Firefox behavior in 
the past after an upgrade, blowing away everything related to Firefox, 
including the $HOME/.mozilla dir (after backing up your bookmarks, etc.) 
and reinstalling usually fixes it.

OK, there is a /chroot/breezy/32bits/proc folder and it has lots of 
stuff in it. There are folders with names like acpi, asound, bus, 
driver, fs, ide, irq, net, scsi, self, sys, syvipc, tty -- and there are a 
ton of folders with numbers, most of which have close to the same 
contents.

Insulting my intelligence is not a possibility. There is no 
intelligence to insult. :(

As to the question, I already did some of that at the university 
yesterday. I can't do more right now because there is no wifi here 
at home -- I'm all ethernet in the house. But I'm going to go to a 
class at Freegeek at 1:00 this afternoon, so I can try stuff there.

Normally I am in 64-bits. The only programs installed in chroot 
(other than what chroot installed) are Firefox32 and its Flash 
plugin, RealPlayer and Adobe Reader 7.0. So unless I specifically 
run one of those apps, everything else is running in 64 bits. Each of 
those programs has a special launch menu item that I added to the 
Gnome Applications menu, using dchroot -d <application> as its 
launch command. Thus, there are two launch items for Firefox, one 
I labeled (old) and the other (32bits). That way I can tell which one I 
am running.  

Yesterday, while connected to pub.net at the university, I found 
that programs installed in the normal 64-bit environment, including 
Firefox, could get out just fine as they always did before. I could 
look at mail with Evolution or Thunderbird, browse with Firefox chat 
with XChat, etc. It was only when I launched 32-bit Firefox from 
chroot that I was unable to get out.

What you asked already occurred to me yesterday, except I didn't 
think of pinging something. But I wanted to find out if the problem 
was 32-bit Firefox or if it was the entire chroot environment that 
was blocking me. So I launched Synaptic32 thinking I would install 
some other internet app in chroot and see if it could get out. Well, I 
got the answer when Synaptic32 was unable to get to the 
repositories. I tried everything, even the extra repositories that I 
have listed. Synaptic32 couldn't go anywhere. But remember that I 
installed 32-bit Firefox, RealPlayer and Adobe Reader 7.0 in chroot 
while at home, where my net connection is via ethernet to the hub, 
router and cable modem. Thus, I pretty well proved that it is the 
entire chroot environment that can't find the wireless.

As to DNS, I wish I had thought to try pinging something by its IP 
address when I was at PSU yesterday, but I did not, so that 
remains a question to be answered. I can do that later today at 
Freegeek.

You are totally correct. But it was the right decision for me. I 
bought this 64-bit laptop because 1) I needed a laptop for school 
and 2) I really wanted to learn Linux. I had tried Corel Linux several 
years ago when it was all the rage but never did more than fiddle 
with it. All the experience did for me was let me know that learning 
Linux was not going to be a snap, and make me a lot of money on 
the Corel stock that I forturnately sold before it tanked. :)

>From past experience with computers and software, trial by fire is 
the way to learn if you really want to learn something. Putting 64-
bit Linux on a laptop as its only OS should do the trick. So far I 
think I made the right decision. The pain was expected. Each time 
I face a challenge I move forward. In the meantime, the computer is 
functional for my school needs. So don't worry -- I will not abandon 
Linux even if it turns out I can't get chroot to see the wifi. I am 
confident it can be done, however. That is, as long as PLUG 
members don't get too annoyed at my constant stupid questions. :(

Thanks for the suggestions so far. :)

   Thanks, Matt. I saved the bookmarks before removing the .mozilla/
directory. After restarting the application (and collecting the appropriate
version of my preferred color scheme) and moving the bookmarks back, all is
well.

    When I invoke firefox-1.5 a message box pops up telling me that the chrome
registration failed. Searching Google for that term shows me that a lot of
people are experiencing the same issue ... but not getting any answers to
their questions of how to resolve it.

    I found one Web site that explained the concept of chrome, but did not

    Does anyone here know what's to be done?

Right.  There's very interesting stuff in there, if you want to learn
more about low-level things.  For example, if you've ever used top, or
a graphical equivalent, it gets all of its information from /proc.

Nonsense.  You're using Linux after all, which means you have a
required combination of intelligence and insanity.

What I am expecting (and I could be wrong of course) is that you would
find your *wired* networking would not work outside of home either. 
Once your wireless has associated with an access point, there's no
difference between it and a wired connection from the application
standpoint.  I expect you're running into issues with your chroot
environment not being able to adapt outside your home network.

Of course, trial by fire is what all of us do all the time with
computers.  It's fun!  My point was more that you picked a
particularily gruesome and uncommon thing to choose as your learning
by doing activity.  There are *plenty* of things to learn about Linux
besides how to install a complete second system inside a chroot
environment.

As for constant stupid questions, my experience so far with PLUG is
that they are asked often, and are supplemented by constant stupid
answers, constant stupid arguments, and constant stupid off-topic
garbage.  That's why I like it :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Real-time monitoring of *nix hosts?
Message-ID: <43D29A2F.6010009@schluting.com>

Hi.

I'm *not* looking for cacti, nagios, or the like.

I am looking for something that will allow me to view programmable data 
about various *nix hosts in real-time. Here's my vision:

A Java (gasp) GUI that lists all computers. It has many different views, 
including some "combined" stats. My first dream is to click on a 
computer's icon and see some vital statistics about it. Free space, 
load, memory hogs, etc. My second dream is to have some combined views, 
perhaps in graph form, like "load averages." This would probably take 
the form of one line per host (or some subset of all hosts) showing 
graphically what the load is.
Optional, crazy ideas include: discovery of all hosts on a subnet that 
happen to be running the monitoring server software, and threshold 
settings to turn icons red (like nagios).

Those are the simplest examples, but surely I'd want to monitor much 
more. Does anything like this exist? Anything close, that might be 
similar? Clearly this implies a server needs to run on each client.. and 
that's ok. (ssh-ing would probably be too slow once the number of hosts 
approaches a few hundred)

I thought I'd ask before going off on some wild and crazy 
caffeine-driven coding frenzy.

-Charlie

P.S. This thought process stemmed from using the EVIL HP OpenView to 
monitor router interface stats in real-time. It was a neat experience, 
that I've recently recalled for some reason.

While the interface is different that what you describe, it sounds
like at least some of the functionality would be covered by GKrellM.

I'm not how to check to see if it is disabled.  Firefox was downloaded
from the main website as a tarball and untarred into
/usr/lib/firefox-1.5/  .

Just did that and no change in behavior.  The only bit of mozillaness
running on the system is firefox.

I did the link to firefox 1.0.7 and it does list plugins, although the
Cisco PIX PDM I'm trying to run gets weird and sort of  half-assed
starts (though is still unusable).

Ganglia?

I use this <gasp> integrated with the dreaded Cacti, Nagios, and the like :)

Perhaps not exactly what you're looking for.  It sounds like you want
a combination of polling (trending long-term data) which is what all
the above tools does, with the addition of when you "click" on the
host, you get the current point in time results in addition?

You could do this with the above tools, using whatever resolution of
polling interval you want.  For instance in Nagios, you could add a
script to force a HOST_SVC_CHECK (will update all configured values
"immediately*"), and add a hostextinfo tag on the host, which can pop
up your prettified GUI (Cacti, Ganglia...) which will display all your
long-term trending with the last (just submitted) results as the last
data sample.

OK, I'm at Freegeek, on their wifi, and guess what? While in the chroot environment if I ping pdx.edu I go nowhere. If I exit to the 64-bit world and ping pdx.edu it returns 131.252.120.50. So then if I go back to chroot and ping 131.252.120.50 it finds the address.

So it's a DNS issue.

Now, how to fix it?

Your line wrapping is broken, BTW.

Do you have an /etc/resolv.conf inside your chroot environment?

I sent that from Free Greek. I have never found a mail client I was 
happy with, so I sent it from Firefox after logging into my Comcast 
account. This time I am using Pegasus on my Windows 2000 
computer at home. I really must decide what to do about e-mail, 
but I'll handle that later. In the meantime, good to know that the 
web mail thing at Comcast doesn't work right.

> Do you have an /etc/resolv.conf inside your chroot environment?

Yes I do. Its contents are:

search comcast.net
nameserver 216.148.227.79
nameserver 204.127.202.19

Hmmm. I installed chroot while at home and connected via ethernet 
to Comcast cable. I have no wifi at home. So does this mean that it 
used Comcast's nameserver by default? And when I am at the 
university (or anyplace away from home where I must use wifi) the 
DNS resolution tries to go through Comcast? Still, why wouldn't it 
still work? OK, maybe the Comcast nameserver gets an 
authentication string from the cable modem, letting it know that it's 
really a paying customer asking for access. So when I am away 
from home it refuses me? Making wild guesses here.

I just did whois on those addresses and they are both AT&T 
Worldnet, not Comcast. Don't know what that means.

Two ways: su - <wife's account>
exit when you are done.

Have you tried the alt-control-FN keys?  Usually some text consoles
reside at F1 through F6.

Session".  Then login as the next user.  You can then use the Switch 
User option again to go back and forth between the two users.  Or do 
Ctrl-Alt-F7 and Ctrl-Alt-F8 to switch back and forth.

Hi,

I have this Fedora 4 server, and I'm trying to use CVS in pserver mode.  But
I get a lame file permissions error, evidently because of SELinux
enforcement.  I read I can "setenforce 0" to overcome this, but is this a
bad idea?  I don't have much of a brain for subtle security issues, but is
there a significant risk, for my lonely little server?  The setenforce man
page just says it puts "SELinux in enforcing mode".  Is that something I
really need?

I ran into a guy that got his hard drives confused and inadvertently 
formatted a windows 98 drive with Linux.

Needless to say he would like to recover some of the files on that drive.

How does one recover from this accident?

Thanks

It can take a *lot* of time to tune selinux policies to suit local 
needs. If you need to get your server running right now, I'd put 
selinux in audit-only mode (while taking all the ordinary steps to 
keep your box safe :-). Then do some reading to find out how to 
overcome all those audit/avc entries in your system log.

And to do that, set the following in /etc/sysconfig/selinux...

SELINUX=permissive

this morning, I just invoked firefox and it came up without the chrome

References: <43D2C2F9.5000401@axpr.net>
Message-ID: <43D35940.8883.8ED1ADEB@localhost>

Earlier in this discussion I posted the following from the boot 
sequence on my Ubuntu-64 Breezy laptop:

mount: special device /media/floppy0 does not exist             [OK]
/home on /chroot/breezy/32bits/home type none (rw,bind)
/tmp on /chroot/breezy/32bits/tmp type none (rw,bind)
/dev on /chroot/breezy/32bits/dev type none (rw,bind)
/proc on /chroot/breezy/32bits/proc type none (rw,bind)
/media/cdrom0 on /chroot/breezy/32bits/media/cdrom0 type none 
(rw,bind)
/usr/share/fonts on /chroot/breezy/32bits/usr/share/fonts type none
(rw,bind) 
                                                                           [FAIL] (in red)

At the time I did not grasp the significance of the above, but after 
googling for a bit I now have a glimmer of what it is about.

First, every single line in the boot sequence ends in [OK] or [FAIL]. 
The lines relating to chroot above do not, except for the last one. I 
finally figured out that the chroot stuff all has one [OK] [FAIL] 
message at the end. In other words, all of those chroot lines failed 
during boot.

Second, evidently BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) has 
something to do with DNS lookups. As far as I can determine it is 
a program that comes with Linux. 

http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/sw/bind/

However, I don't know enough about how this stuff works to 
understand much of what that site is talking about. But it does 
appear that the [FAIL] message during my boot sequence means 
that it is not working in my chroot environment.

Therefore, the fact that I can ping from chroot to an IP address but 
not to a named address may be because BIND failed during boot. 
But that still doesn't explain why my chroot environment can 
resolve names when I am at home with my Comcast cable 
connection via ethernet.

Still trying to figure it out. :(

Instead of using pserver to do your authentication, use the ssh
protocols.  Set your CVSROOT=ext:<user>@<server name>:/<repository>

Maybe SELINUX would forgive you for using this and allow you to operate.

If he just partitioned the drive, he might be able to get back to the
windows by repartitioning the drive a vfat.  The data should still be
there.  But if he created a new file system, then it's to the data
recovery folks.

Ken,

   It stopped raining.

   I have no rational explanation. I did nothing between posting the first
message that Firefox could not find something in it's chromed registry and
the second message, other than kill X, log out last night, and log back in
this morning.

   Perhaps it is magic. Now, if I could only resolve the other
upgrade-generated glitch (not with Firefox), I could get back to what passes
for my life.

I read on the 'net that other people have had the same issue.  After 
restarting Firefox a few times or maybe logging out and back in, 
everything was resolved.  So Firefox is probably recreating whatever 
files it couldn't find before.

   I've replaced gnucash with kmymoney2 (don't ask!). The later works, but it
has these huge icons along the left side of the screen that add no
functionality to the text that's there.

   Among those of you who use KDE there must be at least one who can tell me
how to make the icons go away so I have only the text labels there. Please
share your expertise with me.

Try DriveSavers (.com).  REALLY expensive, but they helped me out mucho 
much when I had a nasty problem during a dd transfer (scribbled on both 
the source and destination drive).  Cost me about $1500 to recover my 
web site, email history, other junk (yeah, I know, but don't talk to me 
about backup strategies now).  Give 'em a call and they will let you 
know if they stand a chance of success.  1-800-440-1904 (I am NOT a 
representative of DriveSavers nor am I compensated in any way for 
recommending them)   ;-)

Matt,

   Yes, there are many messages from folks seeing the same behavior. I guess
it does self resolve after a while. Perhaps the Firefox team uses this to
thumb their noses at Microsoft: "See? Our application fixes itself! Let's see
you do that with Internet Exploder."

I got a 6210 a few months back and it's worked quite nicely for my light
printing needs.  The paper feeder is kinda flimsy, but for ~$200 it's not
a bad unit.

It uses the "HPLIP" Free software from http://hpinkjet.sourceforge.net/.
The only thing it cannot do that the Windows software can is sending a fax
directly from the PC, which I have not needed (although support is planned).

   Yeah, I have a "me-too" to share. Long ago and far away, in the days of DOS
and floppy tape drives, I let myself go 2+ weeks without a backup. Naturally,
that's when my Seagate ST-225 MFM drive (a huge 21M at that time) failed.
This was in the early 1990s, and a local data recover guy charged me about
$400 to get back 85-90 percent of what was there.

   I lived with what I could get, and have always backed up each day (except
the weekends) since then. No implied criticism, Frank, just my own story.
With my own business, the one thing that delayed my migration to linux was
finding a backup system that was both affordable and reliable. It took me
several months to find a solution. Yes. I am a bit obsessive about it. (Or,
is it compulsive? I get the two mixed up; perhaps that's why folks do both.)

I've noticed in the past that Firefox will behave oddly (usually by
displaying some sort of XML-related error messages) when it's been
upgraded. It's only ever a problem when I upgrade while an instance of
Firefox is still running though. Once I close every browser window and
ensure a clean restart (of the browser, not the entire system),
everything is OK.

I know, I should do that, but a hard drive has gone bad on this server, and
so I'm just trying to get things working as before ASAP (the rest of my life
keeps tapping its foot).  This was more of a risk question regarding
SELinux, since I don't know much about that.  For now, I'll just use
"permissive" mode.

If run 1.0.7, exit and then run 1.5 I do get the error message the first
time 1.5 runs.

I think you may have dug to deep here.... it's unlikely that you have
a bind problem, if you did, your 64-bit environment would not work any
better than your 32-bit environment.

It's more likely that your /etc/resolv.conf is being correctly updated
by dhcp-client, while your /<chroot>/etc/resolv.conf is static.  Have
you tried copying the nameservers from your 64-bit resolv.conf into
your 32-bit version? (note that this will only be a valid test if you
do it *while* your 64-bit environment has a working 'net connection
*and* your 32-bit environment is broken.  So, perhaps this is
something to try the next time you are trying to use the PSU wifi.)

If manually copying /etc/resolv.conf into your chroot (backing up the
old chroot resolv.conf first, of course) does fix the problem, then we
can help you to make that process automated.

I only considered the BIND issue because it occured on exactly 
the chroot lines during boot. But let's hope you're right, because I 
couldn't understand much of what BIND seems to be all about. The 
only thing I grasped is that chroot seems to be used a lot as a 
security tool to isolate the rest of the system from what is exposed 
to the outside world, and BIND is somehow involved in that.

I posted more or less the same message to an e-list for Compaq 
R3000 computers with Linux. Most of the R3000 line were AMD-64 
computers, so I figured there might be someone there who had 
already been in the same boat.

Someone responded and said almost the same as you. So 
tomorrow I will be at PSU. I will connect to pub.net via 64-bit 
Firefox, check what /etc/resolv.conf says afterward, then copy this 
into the /chroot/breezy/32bits/resolv.conf file and save it. Then I'll 
try to ping a name from within chroot and see what happens.

If it works I'll post back for further help with automating it.

Thanks for the reply. :)

Becareful here--there are two different uses of "bind".  One if the
Berkeley Internet Name Daemon, "named", which is a common DNS server.
You're probably not running BIND, although BIND is often run in a chroot
environment.

The bind that you're concerned with is involved with filesystem mounts.
To wit, from mount(8):

    Since Linux 2.4.0 it is possible to remount part of the file
    hierarchy somewhere else. The call is
          mount --bind olddir newdir
    After this call the same contents is accessible in two places.  One
    can also remount a single file (on a single file).

Yes, I see now that you are right about BIND, considering that the items on the boot screen said bind, not BIND.

On another issue, I am now at PSU and happily connected and using Firefox from chroot. To make it work first I opened 64-bit Firefox and went to PSU home just to get NoCat to come up and log in. Having done so I hovered over /etc/resolv.conf and noted that now it said "search PSU" instead of "search Comcast" and the IP addresses were different. I sudo - opened Gedit, then opened both resolv.conf files and copied and pasted the new search parameters from the /etc version to the /chroot/breezy/32bits/etc copy and saved it. Finally, I shut down 64-bit Firefox and opened chrooted 32-bit Firefox. It worked!

Of course, when I get home it will probably be broken for Comcast.

So now I need to figure out how to automate this. 'cause copying and pasting is going to become a PITA. I know zero about programming, scripts and such. Hopefully there is a simple way to do it.

Perhaps someone more guruish than myself can confirm this, but perhaps
a hard link between /etc/resolv.conf and <chroot>/etc/resolv.conf
would work?  I assume a symbolic link would barf from inside the
chroot jail.  Then you would not need to worry at all.

Message-ID: <20060123193405.GA14729@gate.kl-ic.com>


A friend recently suffered a computer roasting, and needs another.
All she uses the computer for is web browsing and email from her
AOL account (which I assume can be accessed via a web browser).
No word processor, spreadsheet, anything.  All she would even need
a hard-drive for is to hold her web bookmarks and preferences,
and ISP connection information;  otherwise she could just boot
from a CD.

I could pungle up a Linux machine that boots into Firefox, but
that means I have another machine to maintain.  A distro that
does nothing but Firefox and the programs necessary to support it,
(automatically downloading Java and Flash and Acroread and all the
other proprietary nonsense during install) would be great for an
application like this, especially if the install was obsequeously
simplified.  Does anybody know of such a distro?

Also - a good place to buy $50 800MHz-ish machines is the Tektronix
surplus store, but they are open only a couple of days a month,
and it will be another month before I can get there.  Freegeek
doesn't sell whole systems from their retail store.  Wacky Willies
isn't doing retail any more.  Any other suggestions for places
that sell very inexpensive used PCs?

Yeppers, the blond boy was me. :)

It was while there that I determined that it was a DNS problem, just before your phone went off. Now at the university I have figured out that the 64-bit world is getting DNS addresses from whatever it is logged into, but the chroot world is not. If I manually copy and paste into the resolv.conf file in chroot, then the chroot environment works.

The Tungsten T5 is supposed to be supported by the most recent version
of pilot-link.

What distribution are you using?  I have had mixed results with FC4
and my Sony Clie and Treo 650.  They shipped a development release of
pilot-link which was initially broken.  They finally patched it so the
command-line tools work.  Syncing from other programs like kpilot is
still broken.  The remaining issue is that hotplug takes a long time
to create the devices, long enough that the sync will sometimes fail. 
The solution I found it to manually create a device and use that:

mknod /tmp/pilot c 188 1

If that's all she needs you could go even lower and find a usb thumb drive
distro that has Firefox et al. and completely ditch the need for a HDD. 

It might save the risk of having the HDD crash.

Although, now that I think about it, thumb drives wear out over time.

Just a thought.

A friend recently suffered a computer roasting, and needs another.
All she uses the computer for is web browsing and email from her

No word processor, spreadsheet, anything.  All she would even need
a hard-drive for is to hold her web bookmarks and preferences,

does nothing but Firefox and the programs necessary to support it,

Subject: [PLUG] What happened to my disk?
Message-ID: <20060123195123.BEB324074@joseph.doink.com>


The other day I tried to start an Xterm on my system.  But, I
couldn't because .Xauthority wasn't writable.  It turned out that
/home (/dev/hda7) wasn't writable, nor could I make it writable
by remounting it; there was "trouble" with the filesystem.  After
a bit of searching newsgroup archives I decided it would be
good to run memtest86, run smartctl testing, and fsck the disk.
Memory testing lasted for days and turned up zero failures.
smartctl testing said that everything was OK. fsck found a "zero
time" file and repaired it, but then fsck got stuck and wouldn't
proceed beyond 89.6%.

This is in a fairly new system which I built from parts.  I just
installed Mandriva 2006 on it at the end of November.  I had a
bunch of system lock-ups while troubleshooting my MDV2006 system.
The source of the lock-ups turned out to be bad free and non-free
drivers for my ATI Radeon card.  Those lock-ups required that I
power off the system.  At the next power-up I would (nearly?)
always see a fsck due to my unclean shutdown.  This happened
probably 25-40 times.

After fixing the ATI driver problem, thanks to Mandriva's
"December Club" release, I had the system running for a couple
weeks solid before I noticed an error.

As I see it, I now have two choices.  I can make a new filesystem
on /dev/hda7 and move on like nothing happened.  Or, I can try to
send this 1 year old Seagate 200GB Barracuda back under warranty.
What would you fine folks suggest?

Thanks....

Rod,

   Before I disconnected from the jpilot mail list I thought I saw traffic
about the T5 working on it. I've used jpilot <http://www.jpilot.org/> for
years and haven't found a Palm/Handspring that it doesn't support. If you
adopt it, please tell Judd I sent you. :-)

   My finacee's Handspring Pro has a USB connector. I set /dev/pilot ==
/dev/ttyUSB0 and it works just fine. My Kyocera QCP-6035 has a serial
connector, and that also works fine.

   I believe most of the connection problems are related to the particular
pilot-link version you use. David's been really good at fixing glitches with
particular PDA models.

The whole machine is roasted?  All of it?  Every single bit?  Seriously? 
  I think the rest of what you mentioned you should be careful about. 
*Only* needing a browser is quite a statement.  I predict phone calls to 
you like "I can't open this attachment", think pdf, zip, important .doc 
file from someone.  It's easy to say a person just does basic web and 
email on their computer, but there are usually many other underlying 
needs as well.  And are you sure the machine is completely fried?  You 
can't just get a new <insert computer component here>?  However, you 
know her, I don't.  Just spouting off.

Try downloading and running Seagate's diagnostic tools(Seatools).  They
run standalone(DrDOS) and I believe they are non-destructive.

I guess I should add that smartd dumped this into /var/log/syslog:

 Device: /dev/hda, 2 Currently unreadable (pending) sectors 
 Device: /dev/hda, 2 Offline uncorrectable sectors 
 Device: /dev/hda, ATA error count increased from 0 to 7 
 Device: /dev/hda, ATA error count increased from 7 to 15 

The first two lines seem especially dubious.  But, smartctl said that 
the drive was all fine.

Hmmm....

If the drive has proven itself unreliable, and you have the option of 
free replacement I would choose that.  Seagate will have a bootable 
diagnostics util for download that may tell you if the drive is 
beginning to fail.  I recently ran the Maxtor util on a drive I knew 
wasn't 'right', and it gave the the code to proceed with the RMA.  You 
can also make sure SMART is enabled in the BIOS of the computer.  The 
whole point of the feature is to make known the failure of a drive 
before it happens.  This has saved me in the past as well.

Looks like they have a floppy self-extracting .exe file,
requiring a Windows system to produce a bootable floppy.  They
also have an ISO CD-ROM boot image which just needs to be burned
to CD-R.  I'm gonna go that route.

Thanks for the tip!

Ian, Rich; thanks!  I lazied it and tried kpilot since I got stuck  with 
KDE for a desktop from a FC4 install ( still haven't taken the time to 
reinstall to get things teh way I want them.

I used jpilot for my old PalmIII but that is running on a FC1 system 
that _really_ needs upgrading so I didn't even try it there.


Again thanks.  I now know where to watch for 'gotchas' and possible 
solutions.

Ubuntu, with the Universe and Multiverse repositories enabled.  It's not
*totally* automatic (damn legalities) but all you have to do is enable
them in Synaptic, then click on the packages.

Sure they do.  They generally have several $35 "storeboxes" on hand (550
MHz, 128MB, 10GB) plus 0-2 more interesting (faster) ones.  They also
test their monitors now, and offer a little bit of warranty/support.

If she can demonstrate a need and/or social benefit, she can apply for a
"grantbox" which is quite a bit higher spec.

What do you mean by "whole systems"?  I bought a freekbox there
(400-450MHz) for about $40 several months ago.  No monitor, no
keyboard, etc., but they've got those too, separately.

We bought to box in a pinch when we were having trouble with a file
server (ended up using a new CPU instead).  The box is now a play
machine at the in-law day-care center.

Have any of you tried zabbix?

It implements real-time polling, triggered alerts, and stores
historical data in a mysql db. It also supports data visualisation and
mapping to acheive the "click on host for vital stats" functionality.
It's based on a standard LAMP configuration and is extremely
flexible... just thought I'd throw it out there...

Subject: [PLUG] Strange X-configuration problem: SuSE
Message-ID: <20060123223448.3925.qmail@web50614.mail.yahoo.com>

SuSE has some peculiar characteristics. Some other
Linux distros, such as Debian, drop the user into text
mode automatically when X has unusable settings, but
SuSE does not:

After I installed SuSE 10, the screen resolution was
1600 x 1200 without
hardware acceleration (Radeon 9200SE). For most
purposes, that leaves
little to complain about, but I used yast2 to see if
the system would
support higher performance. When it appeared that X
would come up at higher
values, I saved the settings.

However, I could no longer get into the account where
these changes were
made. The X server was operational at the previous
settings when I logged
on as root, and I was even able to create another user
account with a
functioning X-server.

So that's where I am now. It would still be desirable
to log into the former
account, for then I wouldn't have to customize all the
settings from
scratch. There must be a file(s) in the account I had
been using which
specifies incorrect custom settings. How can I restore
the defaults?

(Perhaps all I need to know is how to disable the
login manager, so that changes can be made without X
running. Hopefully someone who uses SuSE will know.)

Maybe more paranoia than you need, but I just booted an old laptop using
the anonym.OS CD, which loads Firefox, Tor, privoxy, a secure email app,
and AIM, I think, on FreeBSD.

The wallpaper is appropriately subversive. I don't know if it can be
loaded to the HD; if it can I'll be using it on that old laptop for my
coffee-shop machine.

Live and learn!  I don't remember seeing them, so I guess I need to
get my glasses checked.  A freekbox would be just the thing, and Ubuntu
(with a few damned legalities) would be just the right software,
perhaps stripping out the confusing unneeded extras.

If I can burn the resulting install to a CD, and create an alternative
login in case she wipes out her user directory, then keeping the 
machine maintained should be fairly easy - restore from the CD
(skipping the "damned legalities" the second time), copy the user
stuff, and back to functional.

Bad, but perhaps not immediately fatal, sign. Trying Seagate's
diagnostics still seems like a good idea. If the drive is still under
warrenty, call Seagate and tell them what you're seeing.

Two dead sectors certainly accounts for filesystem trouble, and `fsck`
hanging. Likely if the block(s) get written to the drive should remap
them and return it to usability. `badblocks -n` might do this without
destroying data (see what `smartctl` says afterwords), might give up too
early though and not write to the problematic sectors. If that was to
fail, backup, do `cat /dev/zero > <disk>`, and then restoring should
return it to usability. Using `smartctl` to run full tests on the drive
could also get it to remap the sectors.

The underlying issue though is you're seeing two sectors that were
previously okay suddenly die. Over time this does happen, but on a newish
drive, go for the warrenty. This might not yet be terminal, but it could
become so.

I set that up at one point, it did seem promising, had all the
visualization I wanted that Nagios was missing... Unfortunately at the
time (and now that I tried it again recently..) it was very buggy,
though I can say the same for Nagios :)  The 1.0 and 1.1betas worked
well enough most of the time.

Best things:
per-user configurability is great
integrated trending/graphing of info is priceless

Bad:
entirely SQL-based config.

The SQL thing is relative... I personally prefer to have everything
built as text configs, it's easier to track down whats' going on and
make changes.  I find it easy to build generation scripts for
thousands of hosts, and re-create config changes from templates.  I
don't have the ability to do that with configs stored in a database.

IMO

I agree with Russell-- get/borrow a USB drive or a second IDE disk
larger than your original and make an image ASAP.  Your drive is
likely to die suddenly and take your data with it.

dd_rescue (http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/ddrescue/) works nicely for this.

It gets worse.  Not only is HF4569 in the house, but Smith is

I looked around my BIOS and didn't find anything that looked like
it was SMART related.  Any pointers on where to look?

Thanks...

I'm not worried at all about loosing data on that drive.  I
wasn't very far past installing on that system.  I'd created my
user account, copied my skeleton files to it, and started doing a
"burn-in".  I guess it burned.

.. Not totally accurate.  The original Broadcast Flag case that was
heard in the Nth Circuit Court of Appeals was decided against the FCC,
saying that the FCC did not have the authority to require the broadcast
flag be implemented.

Smith's bill would give the FCC that authority, so the case would have
to be tried on a Fair Use basis (which, given the Supreme Court's
impending leaning toward favoring government wrt Alito, might not work
too well).

In case you're interested, the pdf of the proposed bill is here:
http://eff.org/broadcastflag/dcp_act_2006.pdf

A full committee hearing
(http://commerce.senate.gov/hearings/witnesslist.cfm?id=1704) is
scheduled to take place at 10a tomorrow (eastern), Smith and other
senators are on the comittee -- I'd reccomend calling 'em (not Smith,
he's a douchebag) and voicing your concerns.

Or, call Smith and ask him why his Hollywo--er, Oregon constituents need
this bill. ;)

That's my plan at this point.  FWIW, SmartTools found the following:

Since I don't care about the data, I allowed SmartTools to attempt 
repair on those sectors.  It says it fixed them.  I'm running a full 
scan again, just to be sure.  Then I'll try running fsck again to see 
what might happen.

I'll be sending the full report to Seagate.

Thanks for the assist folks.  The references to SmartTools and 
dd_rescue were great.

Cheers....

There may need to be support in the BIOS to handle alerts, but to my
knowledge generally the more crucial part are the OS tools to retrieve
those alerts. On an older system I to tell smarttools (the predecessor of
smartmon) to enable SMART support on the drive. Likely that is what is
done in the BIOS, that enable step, but the tools will handle it just
fine even if an old BIOS doesn't do it.

I'm not really sure I understand the situation you're describing, possibly 
because I don't use the graphical login.  I didn't know, for instance, 
that it even allowed different users to have different default X configs.

But anyway, if you want to just disable the the graphical login manager, 
you can easily do that as root:

# telinit 3

puts the machine into runlevel 3, multiuser with network (but no xdm).  
That should allow you to login and tinker with your X settings. 'startx' 
should then allow you to see if the changes you make get you a viable 
configuration.

What it means by "fixing" is just mapping them out and telling the drive 
not to use those areas any more.  IMHO, this drive won't last long.  I 
would warranty it regardless of whether or not the reported areas are 
"fixed".

Hi,

My company is looking at upgrading our PBX and I'm looking seriously into
pushing Asterisk w/ Digium equipment.  The company is ~25 employees which
relies heavily on the telephone - more then half of the employees placing
and receiving calls during heavy usage of 1 call every 5 minutes.

I contacted Digium asking for a sales pitch, but (surprisingly) they
responded saying they don't have any materials showing the benefits of using
their stuff with Asterisk.

I'd like to hear success and failure stories from the list with Asterisk
running on top of Linux.

Many thanks!

Message-ID: <43D69969.15715.9B844E32@localhost>

Damn! I thought I had chroot handled once I got the DNS issue 
solved, but I should have known better.

Acrobat Reader 7.0 is installed in chroot and runs happily. I can 
open and view any document. So, after finishing a 13-page 
homework document that took me most of the day, I exported it to 
PDF from OO.o Writer and opened it in Reader. It looked fine, so I 
decided to print it on my big-ass PostScript Laserjet. When I 
clicked on Print the dialog box came up but it listed only 
"/usr/bin/lp" as the printer. It should have said "HPLaserjet8000." 
Just for kicks I tried, but it said "/usr/bin/lp does not exist." Well, 
silly computer. Of course it doesn't exist. And if you knew it didn't 
exist, why did you even suggest it? Ubuntu, I swear.

So now I get to figure out how to get the chroot environment to print 
to printers installed in the 64-bit world. More hard links?

Indeed. I cannot begin to tell you veterans how much easier it is to 
learn Linux when you have someone sitting next to you. Were it 
not for the clinics I'd still be trying to figure out how to turn the 
computer on. Wait ... I'm still trying to figure that out. Never mind.

I already offered to bring the goodies. Would it help if I brought 
goodies for the whole Free Geek group? Maybe if I just contracted 
with Safeway for an hourly donut delivery?

Is there anything else I can do to help get this thing moving? Call 
someone? Have a case of scotch delivered to someone?

Acrobat is saying what it always says.. "here's a command line, give me 
the command to run."

If lpr (lp) is installed in the evil chroot, just say: lpr -P 
"Big-ass-laser" (or whatever the printer name is :))

So when are you going to test out the 32-bit version?

OK, tried that. The print dialog box in OO.o calls it LaserJet-8000-
Series-PS. So I appended that in place of Big-ass-laser and got 
"The specified file lpr does not exist." So then I searched and both 
lp and lpr are in /usr/bin, but after a while itoccurred to me that they 
also had to be in /chroot/breezy/32/bits/usr/bin, which they were 
not, so I launched Synaptic32 and installed lpr. At that point it 
seemed to work, except nothing goes to the printer. Reader says it 
is sending the pages to the printer, but the printer receives nothing. 

Apparently I have the printer name wrong. I tried removing the 
dashes (because I thought I remembered that when I created the 
printer I used just spaces), but no go. I also tried quotes and < > 
around it, but always got the same error message. 

I guess I need to figure out what Ubuntu thinks the printer is called. 
If I open System > Administration > Printing it shows it with the 
dashes. Maybe it can't find a printer outside chroot, so I need to 
install the printer inside chroot. But inside chroot all I have is 
command line and Synaptic32 -- no GUI for installing printers. I'll 
have to research that later -- exam today. :(

> So when are you going to test out the 32-bit version?

Not in my plans. Being a bit of a pioneer is good for the learning 
experience. Learning always involves pain. I have a moderately high 
tolerance for pain, as long as I'm allowed to kvetch and yell.

installing lots of these in Portland, some commercial off the shelf, 
others are custom.  Since we also sell VOIP dialtone, we can provide 
complete solutions, installed, with full support. 

    If there is interest in this group, I would be willing to host a 
short hands on introduction to Asterisk IP-PBX in our offices downtown 
Portland.  The idea would be to show how to install and configure your 
own IP-PBX on Linux.  No charge for card-carrying PLUG members. :)

    We are also working on an initiative to add clustering to Asterisk.  
Here is a link to a talk I gave on this subject at a recent Astricon.

I have Debian sid running amd64 with a 32 bit sid chroot.

I have CUPS configured on the amd64 portion.

In the chroot I installed JUST cupsys-bsd and cupsys-client.
After that my Adobe Acrobat, Mozilla, and OpenOffice in the chroot are 
able to print.

Sadly, no story yet.  I didn't do enough work to pull it together over
the winter break, and haven't spent the time yet to pull it off now.
I think I'll be able to do some wrangling this afternoon.

I'm thinking I can pull one off in Februrary.

I'm working on hosting one at FreeGeek, but I have to convince someone
there to help chaperone it.

Helpful people shouldn't be a problem, with sufficient notice.

S'truth.

And if you're worried about too many people for the space, I think clinics 
held at FreeGeek would be more likely to draw me out.

That ought to cut down on excess attendance.

Aaron,

I may have a location in Milwaukie, near King Rd and 82nd Ave. It has 
pretty easy access... Johnson Creek exit off (I-205). I can set up an 
open wifi and lan lines with a cable. I will need to get a hold of some 
people to make sure that it is fine, but it shouldn't be a problem. I 
may also be able to get ongoing permission for this.

How many pc's do you normally have connected?

Thanks! that helps.

However, although now I can print from Acrobat, the print dialog 
box is ridiculous to the point of being useless. I cannot even tell it 
how many copies to print. This is pathetic. No options at all. I also 
have another printer installed and it never appears as a possibility.

I installed cupsys-bsd and cupsys-client via Synaptic32. Did I do 
something wrong?

What version of acrobat reader are you using?  I'm running 7.0 and,
aside from choosing a printer (still done by modifying the lp / lpr
line), I have all those options, and they are very visible.

Okay, I hear the PHP has security problems.

I want to know if people like Java servelets and
Java Server Pages.  Who here is familiar with the
Tomcat container?  Why use Tomcat with apache?

The experimental java compiler in Fedora Core 3,
what's the source and why it is experimental?

Are Java developers at the the whim of Sun when it
comes to using the SDK or not?

No, developers have security problems. The shortest path to a web app in
any language on any platform is insecure. You can write slow, fragile
and insecure code in any language. You can write robust and secure code
in most languages. But it requires planning and thought and experience.

I am.  Apache provides functionality beyond what Tomcat offers (mod_rewrite,
for instance), and it's more efficient at serving static content.

Because it's just an experiment?  :)  If you really want to do Java, I
recommend using a proven compiler, either javac or jikes.

Can you define the question better?  There is a "community process" by which
changes are introduced, but it's Sun's product, after all.  It's not open
source, technically, and some have issues with that:

I've heard the same thing about there being security problems with PHP. 
Do you know of a site on the web, or a book, that shows an example of 
insecure PHP code, and how to make it secure?

If you mean GCJ, it is not at a useable stage, particularly if you are
not extremely well-versed with java allready.  It's behavior is quite
odd at times, and the errors you get won't get you very far googling. 
While I haven't tried this, I seriously doubt any java 1.5 features
have made it into GCJ yet.  I wish the best of luck to GCJ devs, but I
can't advocate using an experimental compiler of any sort for serious
work.

Well, IBM has a reasonable SDK for java also, but there are
differences between the two.  I don't believe either SDK is
open-source, although IBM's might be under the CPL or EPL.

Hmmm. It is Reader 7.0 installed just the other day with 
Synaptic32 into chroot on my Ubuntu-64 Breezy laptop. And the 
cupsys-bsd and cupsys-client are both 1.1.23-10ubuntu4, installed 
last night, also via Synaptic32.

Clearly, something is haywire here. It makes no sense for a print 
dialog box not to have even a place for the number of copies. There 
must be something on your computer that is missing in my 
installation.

Here is an ASCII representation of my print dialog box:

Print to
o   Printer Command [                               ]
o   File  File Name    [                               ]  [Browse]
Print range
o   All
o   Current page
o   Pages from [   ] to [    ]
Subset  [ All pages in range ]  [ ] Reverse pages
[ ]  Print comments
Postscript options
[ ]  Shrink oversize pages to paper size   o Level 2
[ ]  Expand small pages to paper size     o Level 3
[ ]  Optimize for speed
[ ]  Download Asian fonts
[ ]  Save printer memory
                                            [ Cancel ]   [    OK    ]


That's all there is. No box to enter the number of copies. No button 
for "advanced," "collated," "duplex" or anything else.

On my Windows machine some things are missing until you select 
the printer that has those features, then they magically appear. I 
wonder if that is the source of the problem.

I misspoke -- we are seeing the same print dialog, with the same
options.  I'm sorry for that.  To attone, a bit ;), I dug out the lp
man page.  -n <copies> is the parameter you want, and you should be
able to add that to the Printer Command string, assuming it is set to
<somepath>/lp.  The other likely option is that it is set to
<somepath>/lpr.  In the latter case, the switch is -# <copies>.  You
can also specify the printer here with either command (-P printername
in lpr, -d printername in lp).

So, to sum it up (and because I like examples...):

if Print Command is set to /usr/bin/lp, and you want 5 copies, then
change it to read:
/usr/bin/lp -n 5

if Print Command is set to /usr/bin/lpr, and you want the 5 copies:
/usr/bin/lpr -# 5

If you want to print the 5 copies to the printer "myOtherPrinter":

/usr/bin/lp -n 5 -d myOtherPrinter
or
/usr/bin/lpr -# 5 -P myOtherPrinter

I haven't tested these recently, but I've used them in years past.  I
know you're probably not thrilled with this interface.. but with
previous versions of Acrobat all we got were the Print Command lines. 
It's nice that the rest of the options are in a gui now (and also nice
that the printer command is still accessable -- you can do excelent
things there that would never fit in a pure GUI :).

Hope that helps,
Rogan

Christian:

. Regarding a monthly clinic, where people bring in their computer.
. Aaron seems to have made arrangements @ Freegeek for each 3rd Sunday.
. Beginning with Sun-Feb-19-2006.
.
. But why can't there be two clinics?
. You never know how things are going to work out.
. I hope you will pursue the other location too, on a different day.
.
. About 50 attended the time I showed up at the high school.
. Roughly 1/2 to 2/3 brought along a computer.

Warm regards,
Chuck Langenberg

You'd have to scan every binary on a system to get a full list, but 
you can tell which libraries are currently in use by which 
applications using lsof (here in a nifty pipe):

lsof | egrep '\.so(\.|$)' | awk '{print $9" "$1}' | sort -u

Just reverse the $9 and the $1 in the awk invocation if you want the 
list sorted by application rather than library.

There's no method to do this other than brute force. You could write
a script to search the entire file system for binary executables and
run ldd on each one.

There's tricks you can do with package management utilities to figure
out these sort of dependencies. One simple method is to try to uninstall
the library's package and see what other packages would have to go as well.
But this wouldn't account for any executables on your file system that
got there by means other than a package.

If you just want to know what running applications are using the shared
library, just grep the output of lsof for the library name.

   Hmm-m-m. That's like asking how many times you missed having an accident
while driving.

   My reason for asking is that I know the libraries used for an Xfce panel
plugin but not the application name. I was hoping to find the latter via the
former.

   In any case, I discovered how to find the installed plugins (right-click on
the panel move bars on either end) so now it's moot.

Many thanks,

Rich

It appears there is no client for that service.  From what I read it 
seems the source has the application installed and streams his desktop 
to glance.net.  The client(s) who wish to see that persons desktop type 
in a web address to see the stream coming from glance.net.  So they are 
proxying the stream.  Sounds like MS Live Meeting but cheaper.  Probably 
not a great option if you view your company data as highly secretive.

I have used it, not very long ago.  I actually liked it much better than OO,
because of the startup time.  It's very fast, fairly stable, and easy to
install/use.  OO has been none of those, in my experience, though I haven't
worked with it recently.

However, I've started running Word via XCrossoverOffice, because of some
stupid Word-only features I have to use.

Rich,

I am using both AbiWord and OOo. Abiword runs better on my old slow 
laptop (Sony Viao 700mhz, 128 ram, Debian). I am sure that OOo would run 
better if I had resouces that were more sufficient. I have also ran both 
of them on MS XP Platform, AbiWord doesn't perform as well as OOo. OOo 
doesn't do well with my cruddy little laptop. (This is my limited 
experience with the two products.)

Was there anything specific you wanted to know about it?

christian

Like a bicycle to an SUV. :)

Abiword is small, fast, and simple. I like it because I write a lot of 
HTML-formatted docs for the web, and I manually tag everything. Abiword lets 
me give them .html extensions, save them as text files, and then it opens 
them as plain text. Other word processors insist on rendering the HTML, which 
is useless for editing.

That's the main thing I like it for, plus the word count command is in a 
top-level menu, instead of hidden away. It does mail merge, tables, styles, 
spell/grammar checker, footers, headers, and the usual formatting stuff. It 
uses the horrid gnome print dialog, which is essentially a printer chooser 
and nothing else useful.

For short simple documents it's nice. I wouldn't use it to write a book.

christian,

   After looking at the AbiWord web site, yes.

   I use nothing in OO.o other than the writer so a single-purpose tool is my
preference. Because my clients and regulatory agencies do everything in M$
Word, I need to be able to import and export processed words in that format.
I also need to be able to convert my _old_ WordPerfect docs as necessary
(Version 6.2c in DOS and 8 in linux.) Finally, I need to be able to directly
convert a document to PDF.

   Looking at the import/export filter matrix on their Web site it appears
that support for all this is almost -- but not quite -- there. Am I mistaken?

   Otherwise, I do no heavy formatting with OO.o; just letters and proposals.
Text-heavy documents I do with LaTeX (anything with equations, too) and
eye-candy-heavy documents I'll be doing with Scribus, the page layout
application. So, if AbiWord has the conversion filters I need, I'd rather use
a lightweight tool and forego all the OO.o stuff that I never use.

Thanks,

Rich

Carla,

   Me, neither. I used LyX for my book. But, I also use emacs when I need to
do some html for the web site.

   As I wrote in response to Christian's message, I use a word processor
primarily for letters and proposals. But, I get an awful lot of .doc files
(adjective chosen with care) that I need to read and save in .odt. Sometimes
I also need to send a client or agency a document in Word format. Quite
often, I'll convert the letter or proposal to .pdf so I can e-mail it as an
attachment (using my signature graphic obtained with my old Olympus digital
camera).

   So for me, the import/export filters are the critical issues, not the heavy
formatting. Of course, for letters, I have designed a letterhead page and
continuation pages, which I presume AbiWord will support.

Thanks,

Rich

   Turns out that OO.o-2.0 starts much faster than did the 1.1 series.

   Macro malware? :-) I've never used Word, but if OO.o is a clone, then I
hope to never have to use it. I used WordPerfect for 18 years so I compare
everything to that, and they all fall short. But, life goes on.

I have both installed, but I live in OO.o Writer. AbiWord doesn't 
have half the capbilities that I need. It can't even see OpenType 
fonts installed on the computer.

I keep it for only one reason: OO.o has always had a problem with 
its clipboard. Even the Windows version does not work right. It gets 
"stuck" and can't see new stuff copied to the clipboard from other 
applications. Sometimes it can't even see stuff copied from itself. 
The workaround is to select just one space and copy it to the 
clipboard. This clears the OO.o clipboard so it can see new stuff in 
the clipboard. And then, sometimes it simply can't see the text 
from another application no matter what you do.

That's what I keep AbiWord for. If something won't paste into OO.o 
Writer I open AbiWord and paste it into an AbiWord document. 
Then I select it in AbiWord and copy it to the clipboard again. 
Afterwards OO.o is happy to paste it in. 

Copying and pasting in Linux requires frequent subterfuges.

   Well, I tend to use only a couple of Type1 fonts: Bitstream Amerigo and
Baker Signet are the two body text typefaces I use.

> Copying and pasting in Linux requires frequent subterfuges.

   I've not found this to be true with the applications I use. I copy text
with the trackball and left key, then paste it with both keys. I cut and
paste between X apps, between console apps, and between the two types. Only
now and then do I find something that won't work. However, somethimes I need
to use the shift key, too.

Charles,

   That's the proper address.

              ^^^^^^^^^

   This is from an embedded string that I've seen only in spam sent here:
"schemas-microsoft-com" is part of it. From what I've seen that seems to be
something from their application a lot of spammers use to generate
html-formatted spam.

I don't have anything good to say about either OpenOffice.org or Abiword 
as a Microsoft Word replacement. They just don't cut it -- the fonts are 
messed up, the reading of Microsoft proprietary formats is incomplete 
and often incorrect, and both of them crash regularly on large 
documents. As far as I'm concerned, they are a waste of time and disk 
space. Sorry to be blunt, but if you have to work with Word documents, 
do yourself a favor and use Word.

If you *don't* have a Microsoft Word compatibility requirement, however, 
there are many fine open source options. LyX and TeXmacs in the LaTeX 
world are wonderful. Scribus is a great open source desktop publishing 
tool, and there are some great HTML editors out there as well.

   My, my. I think you mis-read what I wrote, Ed. Let me try again. I
certainly did not mean to raise your blood pressure!

   -- I've never used Word and I will not use any software from Microsoft. No
need for it. Personal preference, YMMV.

   -- I use OO.o for letters and proposals; short documents only.

   -- When I do get stuff in Word format from clients and agencies I've not
had any problems importing them in OO.o so that they're readable. Frankly, I
could not care less what fonts are in the original document (generally Times
Roman/12 pt; I guess that's the default and no one ever changes it). One of
the first things I do is block the entire document and change the font to
Bitstream Amerigo/10pt as well as fully justify all paragraphs. This makes the
document clearly readable on both the monitor and printed output and almost
always decreases the page count which I like when I need to print the
document.

   -- I've not had OO.o crash on any Microsoft Word document. This may well be
that when I get a huge document (usually from an agency), it's generally as a
.pdf, not .doc, file. My experience with OO.o goes back to when the linux
kernel switched from libc5 to libc6 and the Corel WordPerfect/Linux-8 would
no longer load and run -- except for Paul Heinlein. :-)

   -- As I wrote, on occasion I do need Word compatibility. Different writing
objectives require different tools. One size does not fit all, despite the
Microsoft marketing efforts.

   LyX is a great front-end to LaTeX; I used it for my book (Springer prefers
.tex submissions and has a TeXpert on staff in New York) and for all articles
and reports that I write. There is currently an active thread on the LyX mail
list about getting the letter class to work with letterhead paper. I've
worked out how to get my company logo/letterhead on reports and slides; the
effort for writing a letter in LyX is not worth it for me because OO.o is
perfect for this.

   Scribus is a page layout application; I'm trying to learn it now so I can
produce some marketing brochures for our fuzzy system model approach to
quantifying subjectivity in the environmental regulatory world. It's no more
appropriate for letters, proposals, and other processed words than would be
PageMaker, Ventura Publisher, or Quark Express in the Microsoft world.

   For coding -- HTML, C, Python -- no word processor is appropriate. That's
why there's emacs, vi, joe, and several dozen more plain text editors that
run from the command line or with a GUI front end.

   Regardless of my needs and preferences, I will not try to change your
preference for using Microsoft Word for whatever you want it to do. The point
of my original message is that I use only the Writer part of OO.o (and a
fraction of its capabilities at that), and nothing else in the "Office"
suite. So, if AbiWord has the import/export filters for my limited needs, I'd
prefer to have a more lightweight application installed.

Thanks for your input; it's always worth reading,

Subject: [PLUG] GTK2+ 3D Look
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0601291526430.29831@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've searched on Google for an answer and cannot find how to make the
widgets on dialog boxes and similar displays have a 3D appearance. This does
not seem to be a desktop/window manager issue; I can change the Xfce4 themes
and they affect only the window frames and decorations, not dialog boxes,
buttons, and the like.

   Do I need to build and install the gtk-engines for this? It's been quite a
long time, but I thought that I used to have a 3D look to widgets instead of
the flat 2D appearance.

   One of the reasons I'd like to learn how to add some depth to the display
is the appearance of the application I'm developing. I'd rather it have some
visual appeal instead of its current, boring, flat look. This is not a
critical issue for that application or those I run here, but I'm pretty sure
that GTK2+ supports a 3D appearance like the first version did.

Message-ID: <20060130001419.GA13067@gate.kl-ic.com>


I stopped by Freegeek on Saturday, and chanced upon Oso, and talked
a couple of minutes about holding Linux Clinic at Freegeek on Sundays.
He had heard about it, and thought the community council might like it.
I am hard of hearing, and didn't catch all he said, so there might be
some errors in what follows, but here goes:

Oso mentioned two gating items.  First, we need to convince someone
authorized, with a key, to be there with us.  Second, these things
are decided by the Freegeek community council, so we need to make
our pitch to them.

The community council meets on the 3rd Wednesday of the month at
7:15pm ( see http://wiki.freegeek.org/index.php/Community_Council ).
We just missed the last one, the next one is on Feb 15.  We need to
get on the agenda for that meeting, and have what we want to say 
figured out.

---

If we do this, our mix will change - we are moving out of a rich
suburban high school and into industrial southeast.  We will probably
have a lot of newbies just out of freegeek training, some random
appearances by street people, and other possible upsets.  I think
the change will be rewarding, but we may have to set up some extra
procedures that Dan and Paul and Eric did not need.

I don't want to lead this, but I can contribute and participate.  I
suggest that we put together a list of volunteers that can help the
"keymaster" by learning the layout and directing attendees to the
loo and cleaning up afterwards and such.  Given how much work this
was for our previous Linux Clinic hosts, I would suggest at least
6 people, each committed to being there at least 8 months out of 12
during the year.  I volunteer, so we need 5 more.  Remember, this is
a commitment, so that means giving up other things for one Sunday a
month.  The fearless leader will need to be there pretty much every
month.

We need to pick which Sunday in the month.  The volunteers choose,
of course.

So who wants to be Gozer//// leader of this motley crew?

As long as the volunteers don't all have to be Linux experts, I will 
be one of the six. I can be there probably every month. However, I 
don't think I can handle being the supreme leader -- I'm more cut 
out to be a drone than the queen.

And I'll also bring the goodies, even enough to leave a surplus for 
the Free Geek people. In fact, letting everyone know there will 
always be goodies might increase attendance. :)

Why Sunday?  What is wrong with 3rd Saturday as we've done historically?

I think Free Geek has a lot of stuff happening on Saturdays. For 
one thing they have classes then.

Keith

If you can't find anyone else..  I would like to apply for the job..

Ever since CLUG <Clark Linux User Group> died, I have been adrift on the
sea of loneliness.  No where to go...  I was the CLUG person for six
wonderful years..

If I had a place to go the Third Sunday < or the First, or Second, or,
etc> 

This quarter <till second week in March> I am in class every night and
most of Saturday.  Other then that.. FREE.  Especially SUNDAY!!

Subject: [PLUG] Sound recording -- not
Message-ID: <43DDAEF3.6080707@dslnorthwest.net>

It all started with a new sound card, replacing a MB PC97 which yielded garbled 
sound.  The new card plays well, but I cannot record using anything I tried: 
Audacity, arecord, ecasignalview.  The old card recorded fine.  (There are 
problems with other parts of the system, but let's hope that they are 
unrelated.) I dual boot (weaning myself away from Win ME); recording is ok in 
windows.  That says that the stuff outside the computer are ok.

The MB card is disabled in the Bios.

I have played with the switches and sliders in kmix, but no go.

I had the help of my son installing the system, but he is off at college up to 
his clavicles in math and physics, so I, a very new newbie, is left at home 
trying to fathom this arcane stuff.  I do not pretend to understand the 
following, but hope that one of the many wizards out there will, and can point 
me in the direction of a solution.

I will be forever grateful.

Well ... for openers, do you have all the "alsa-tools" and "alsa-utils" 
and OSS compatibility packages loaded? If so, open a command window and try

$ alsamixer

You should get a nice control panel. It will be sound card specific, and 
if it doesn't show the sound card you think you have, there's more 
configuration you need to do. If it does show the right sound card, hit 
"tab" until it shows sliders for all of the gizmos your sound card has.

I'm assuming since you have output sound, there's nothing wrong there. 
So right-arrow over to the inputs you're using. If it's line input, make 
sure that isn't muted and check the volume. If it's microphone, make 
sure that isn't muted and check the volume.

All this assumes there's only a single sound card. If there are more 
than one, there's a lot of extra configuration work you need to do. I 
still don't have that working right, so I'm only an expert on the fact 
that it's tough to get working. :)

One other hint -- I can't confirm this as a fact, but it's logical to 
me. Make sure all the sound modules in your kernel are compiled as 
loadable modules and not compiled directly into the kernel.

I have arranged for that.  I have two Key people and another significant
FG community member on board.  My plan is for the third Sunday, Feb 19.
There's a shindig there the night before, so I'm planning on coming in
early to do some cleanup.

Perhaps.  I think it depends on whether it's a PLUG thing, a FreeGeek
thing or (other).  I was wanting to bill it as "Linux Clinic at
FreeGeek", so as to no exclude That Other Group, but it looks like
there's enough interest here to make it a PLUG thing.

One thing is that I'll have a lot more free time after Feb 10, and
I intend to put some of that time into being more involved at FG.

Easy enough.  Folks at FG like the idea, especially since it brings in
more cool techie folks.  F'r instance, they have a space called The
White Hole just *full* of server-class equipment that they're not
entirely sure what to do with.

And I still want to try and coordinate the Clinic with Ted Havelka's
Sun/SGI/other tech sessions.

Should've given more progress reports,

There are a couple in Portland, but I find their prices are twice as high as 
what it costs me to get a new OEM cart on eBay.

I'll second that.  I recently spent far too long getting my own Audigy2
to work properly (I'm a stickler for 5.1 out), and had to do some fancy
footwork with debian and alsa.  I can confirm that your the devices
listed in asound/devices is roughly the right length for an audigy2, so
it may be something as simple as getting the right alsa software and
unmuting the line-in. ;)

www.cfriends.com in Ceder Hills sells toner and other refill supplies as 
well as the cartridges. You can drop by and purchase over the counter.

For my HP printer the carts are around $120, refilled carts around $80 and 
refill kits around $20. Toner in 10 kilo bags (messy but cheap) brings this 
down to around $10 per refill (this is an unusually big cartridge).

Thanks
JK

Outstanding!  If you are there listening as the questions go by, you
will wander towards expert soon enough.  The "supreme leader" should
be somebody who can motivate volunteers to show up, and can field the
occasional complaint from freegeek or from attendees with good cheer. 
The rest of the volunteers can exercise "leadership qualities" through
pro-active support of the supreme leader; that means anticipating
what the leader will want and doing it before they ask.

Leadership itself involves a degree of listening, multitasking and
respect for authority that I'm not wired for.  The volunteers can
pick the leader from among ourselves.

Indeed - it might even help motivate the keymaster.  But we may also
need to appoint Zuul the "gutkeeper", to run us around the block a
few times to work off some of the calories.  Computers can be hazardous
to cardiovascular health.

Keith

BTW, references to Keymaster, Gatekeeper, Zuul and Gozer are from the
movie "Ghostbusters".  We can be the Gates-busters.  I'll be Venkman.

Perhaps your microphone is not selected. In kmix, the button underneath
the slider is used to select  which input device will be used for recording.
>From the Kmix Manual
"If a control supports recording, there will be a red Record LED. If
the LED is lit (bright red), the control is selected for recording. If
it is not lit (dark red), the control is NOT selected for recording."

Hope this helps,

Message-ID: <9e0a35780601300949obbc5ac1w5fc93a0043acc1cd@mail.gmail.com>

I have a CentOS 4 server that has some serious problems.  It's remote so I'm
hoping to fix it through SSH.  I've stopped all services (except SSH).

Here's a df output:

Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1              50G  2.1G   45G   5% /

And here's a sample of some of the files that are borked.  Everything that's
hosed appears under /usr:

There's the same oddball permissions for many files under /usr/lib too.
Unfortunately, when I try to change the permissions or restore the files
from backup, I get a "Read-only file system" error, although "mount" shows
that the root filesystem is (rw).  Running "mount -o remount,rw /" fails
with "mount: block device /dev/sda1 is write-protected, mounting read-only".

dmesg and the messages file have errors such as these:

attempt to access beyond end of device
sda1: rw=0, want=2283283176, limit=104856192

init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (36706)
init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (4411)
init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (71545)

I know if I reboot this box then it's not coming back up, which would be a
problem for me since the server is in another city.  Does anyone have any
suggestions on how else I might be able to fix things?
Thanks,
~M

I have done as Ed suggested.  The correct card is showing in the mixer, and I
moved all the sliders (except optical and digital), to no avail.  I do NOT have
all the ALSA stuff loaded..my project manager lists some 32 ALSA related items.
What is loaded:

alsa-base, alsa-utils, gststreamer0.8-alsa, libasound2, libasound2-dev, and
linux-sound-base.

There is another card in the system (on MB), although as I said it is disabled
in the BIOS.

Any other suggestions?

Bill,
My kmix shows only bright or dark GREEN lights ABOVE the sliders.  I am
connected to the line input on the card (blue jack).

There is a chain group, founded in Eugene, called Rapid Refill Ink, which  
looks pretty good. They have an office and Salem, and just opened one in  
McMinnville (which is near where I live, and which I have seen). Don't  
know if they're in Portland yet, but worth a look. They say they carry all  
major brands.

A perhaps important note.  When I ran alsamixer I note that there is no input
marked "line", only one marked "line-2".  The card has no "line-2"

Looks like your root is hosed, though is sda really a 1TB SCSI disk?

If you have a swap partition, I'd recommend using the Debian
remote-install trick of installing a new root in the swap partition.
But if there's a risk of data-corruption or a bad drive, the only safe
thing to do is shut the dang thing down.

Are you doing a backup of /home, /var and /etc?

Have you looked at SquirrelMail? I found it dead simple to config (I use

I would love to help out in whatever capacity is necessary (and I do have Linux skills so I can be doubly-useful).  What time on Sundays, I am currently committed to doing things at my zen sangha on Sundays until about noon and need to stick to that of a necessity.

Outstanding!  If you are there listening as the questions go by, you
will wander towards expert soon enough.  The "supreme leader" should
be somebody who can motivate volunteers to show up, and can field the
occasional complaint from freegeek or from attendees with good cheer. 
The rest of the volunteers can exercise "leadership qualities" through
pro-active support of the supreme leader; that means anticipating
what the leader will want and doing it before they ask.

Leadership itself involves a degree of listening, multitasking and
respect for authority that I'm not wired for.  The volunteers can
pick the leader from among ourselves.

Indeed - it might even help motivate the keymaster.  But we may also
need to appoint Zuul the "gutkeeper", to run us around the block a
few times to work off some of the calories.  Computers can be hazardous
to cardiovascular health.

My KMix (3.5) shows only green LEDs on the Output tab, but on the Input tab there are both green LEDs and red LEDs.

The green LEDs unmute the channel for monitoring in real-time, and the red LED selects the record source

Also, you might try right-clicking (or second mouse button, if it's not the right one) in the area of the Input tab in KMix, and choose Channels. That should bring up a list of available channels usable for input.

If your card is calling the line input 'line-2', there's not a lot you can do about it. If that input name doesn't correspond with the jack however, it may be one of those on-board headers designed for a drive-bay "AudioDrive" or whatever Creative calls those things. In which case, I think there might be a 'line' or 'line-1' channel that's hidden from you.

I was just going to say it looks like the filesystem is corrupted, it seems to think it's larger than the physical partition.

Given the size of some of the files you listed, I'm guessing you've got extensive filesystem corruption. A remote-reinstall would be tricky but I'd give that a shot if possible. (In the future it might be wise to have a 256M boot partition where you can put things like recovery images - that's what I do on all my servers)

Aaron,

My kmix is 2.6.1 (Using KDE 3.4.3).  There is no input tab!  Only OUTPUT and 
SWITCHES. A right click gets me a menu, but it is not functional.

If that input name doesn't correspond with the jack however, it may be one of those on-board headers designed for a drive-bay "AudioDrive" or whatever Creative calls those things. In which case, I think there might be a 'line' or 'line-1' channel that's hidden from you.

Thanks for your response, Aaron.  Yeah, it does have 1TB using hardware
RAID.  Guess I'll be driving over to pay my sick server a visit...

I can certainly understand that.  I was planning on holding the Clinic
noon-4PM.  No problem if you show up after noon, the help (or company,
if nobody shows up) is most appreciated.

I have, and I get the impression that it only works via IMAP or POP. I
just want the web equivalent of mutt (or pine or elm): an app that
reads local mboxs and maildirs for whichever user has authenticated.
That sort of app seems surprisingly difficult to find.

Indeed, I checked as soon as you posted your question.  No local-storage

Monitoring the PLUG and Free Geek maillists, I can see there is a great
deal of interest in restarting the Linux Clinic at Free Geek.  As a
Linux Advocate, I feel compelled to add my support to the effort.

I am the Sales Coordinator at Free Geek.  As a staff member, I have
keys, and the ability to provide oversight and responsibility for the
security of Free Geek during these sessions.  A knowledge of the Policy
and Operation of Free Geek are also necessary in planning the Clinic.

There are basically two approaches to setting up the clinic.  The first
would be to run it as a separate entity from Free Geek.  This would
require approval, and scheduling of the space on a continuous basis.  It
would also require a Staff person to be present, then the Clinic would
supply all of it's own leaders to conduct the clinic.  The second
approach would be to have Free Geek host the Clinic with the assitance
of PLUG and other volunteers, plus Free Geek Staff and volunteers.

Before any proposal can be submitted to council, a plan needs to be in
place to implement the Clinic.  I would ask that all of the interested
parties meet the Sunday before the council meeting, that would be Sun.
Feb. 12th, say 2pm in the afternoon.  I will host the meeting, provide
answers to questions about the space and Policies, so we can decide if
or how to proceed to the council with a proposal, and try to anticipate
what questions they may need answered to gain approval.  I do think they
would approve, as the Council is "everyone" at Free Geek, and there
seems to be a lot of interest there already.

If the council approves, I will commit to coming in at Noon each third
Sunday to open the space and provide security,safety, and oversight.  I
don't know how much help I will be, as I am usually a little burned out
that day, because I have dealt with customers and a million questions in
the Thrift Store all of Saturday.  I can however use the store's cd
burner to burn disto's in advance, and during the Clinic.

I saw someone question why not Saturday?  The answer is that Free Geek
is open for business Tuesday thru Saturday, 11am-7pm.  The  place is too
hectic, the Staff and Core volunteers are busy with the day to day, and
the classroom is used for classes most days we are open.  That only
leaves the days we are closed, Sunday and Monday.  Sunday seems to be
the only day that would fit working folks schedules.

Hope you can all make it to the meeting and help us get the ball in
play.

Would usermin fit the bill?

http://www.webmin.com/index6.html

Since it runs on a different port than webmin, you probably could just
install that and configure for the users / applications you want each
person to access.

Unfortunately, I don't know much about it myself, so I can't help anymore
than that.

The following showed up with Synaptic Package Manager the other day.  We 
took a power burp that trashed a power supply. The power supply seems to 
have taken a hard drive circuit board with it (that's all I have been 
able to diagnose so far on a WinDoze box).  On the dual boot Linux box 
it hurt the file system on Suse10.  Until this I thought Ubuntu had 
escaped unscathed.

Any ideas on fixing this?

   No. Firefox-1.5 in use here.

   Now and then I get a DNS error; a URL cannot be resolved or contacted, but
that's temporary.

Ouch. Massive filesystem corruption. If you're lucky `fsck` might make
somethings usable again. Looks like your conclusion of restoring from
backups is the best approach. I'd do a full `mkfs` before restoring
though.

Any ideas what caused this? You'll want to identify and fix it, as
otherwise it will happen again.

Has the RAID device detected errors and gone read-only? Most likely
you're running into the ext2 errors behavior. The kernel saw errors and
marked the filesystem read-only, attempting to go back read-write fails
due to flags in the filesystem superblock. `fsck` /might/ get it to a
point where you can at least write. I'd only use that as a stepping stone
prior to a `mkfs` on the device.

Good luck.

Assuming your root filesystem is semi-intact, you might be able to copy
sshd, restore and the minimal libraries to run them to your root
filesystem and be able to unmount /usr as a starting point. As Aaron
mentioned, you can run `swapoff` and then do an `mkfs` on your swap
device and use that for working space while you restore.

Given that you've still got sshd and a shell, there is some hope, but
this is going to be a real challenge.

I have had that same problem, don't know the cause. Have to reboot to get it
working. Probably should upgrade to 1.5, although I am not sure that it is a
Firefox problem or a network problem. I will have to see if Epiphany works
when Firefox does not.

Message-ID: <B0016851924@bct-mail.bctonline.com>

I'd like to get a small mouse that I can pack along with my laptop.

I find I can work much faster with a mouse than with the touchpad.

I'd like to know if there are any mice that have been found to be especially
well-suited for this purpose.

 

The laptop is an IBM T42 if that matters.

 

Thanks,

It's my conclusion that you CANNOT "upgrade" from one version to another 
of firefox.  You must nuke the old one and install (or re-install) the 
new one.  Seems to be a lot of "stuff" left laying around if you try to 
upgrade.  I am running 1.5 now and it seems more stable and available 
than the earlier ones.  Also - the plugins, extensions and themes all 
upload and work.  Nice (finally).

I'd also like to find a good keyboard with a Dvorak layout.

Preferably one that does all of the translations internally so no system
config changes are necessary.

Does anyone on the list use a Dvorak keyboard that they could recommend?

Rick, et. al.

Please let me know if the Feb 12th meeting becomes (or is) definite.  I
am a sometimes-attender to the clinic, and recently had my FreeGeek
orientation (though having just changed jobs, my free time is a bit
taxed).  I intend to attend regularly, and if my schedule quiets down a
bit, am hoping to offer to help out in a more useful capacity.

I've shopped for these several times, but never been convinced enough by 
any one to buy one at 3x the price of a qwerty.  Same goes for the 
keylabels.

Whatever's plugged into your computer :-)  Seriously though, it has the 
added benefit of encrypted authentication:

  login:  prry
  password:  mflaoo,rpe
  Login failed.

Ok, actually seriously...  Mis-labeled keyboards offer a much better 
selection than the correctly labeled ones and you're not supposed to be 
looking at the keys anyway.  Maybe if you can find one locally you 
would have a chance to try out the feel of the keys.  When you narrow 
the options to only the ones with a hardware switch, I believe you only 
have about 3 companies to choose from.

My personal preference is the Logitech V200 ... incredibly small receiver (unlike some I've had in the past) and I've gone for over a year on one set of AA batteries.

Their entire line of 'notebook' mice is here: http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/productlist/US/EN,crid=2140,categoryid=415

Several months ago, shortly after buying my Compaq laptop, I 
bought a Logitecj cordless wireless USB mpuse to carry along with 
my laptop. It;s the size of an ordinary-to-small desktop computer 
mouse, which is what I loke about it. Most of the "laptop{" mice I 
find in the stores are really too small.

It has performed flawlessly for me in Linux. It doesn't matter when 
you plug in the little USB stick that serves as its connection. Linux 
automatically sees it and the mouse immediately goes to work 
without tweaking. I gave about $30 for it at Fry's.

 From time to time I try to keep up with the RepRap project, which uses

http://reprap.blogspot.com/

An aside on one of the entries was this mention of a cheap hardware 
project under development at MIT:

      I spoke to MIT's Jim Gettys of the One Laptop Per Child project,
      who is sympathetic to our cause but has other problems to deal with
      right now. The good news for us is that he plans to release a
      "Hacker" version of the OLPC which comes without case and with
      access to built-in ports that the OLPC is not otherwise interested
      in.

I thought it might be of interest to some of you.

If your T42 has bluetooth internally the V270 is the same as the V200
form factor, but bluetooth so no receiver needed.

   I've downloaded, built, and installed Scribus-1.2.4.1 and I'm trying to

frame is not working. I've written to the scribus mail list about this, but
I'm also curious if anyone on this mail list is using Scribus. If so, it
would be nice to share insight and knowledge.

   This looks like a very good additional writing tool, once I become better

Because it's pushing the responsibility of managing mailboxes into the
web mail application, when there are already numerous IMAP servers which
do it more reliably.  Managing local access to mail folders is
non-trivial in many cases and throughout the years has been the source
of lots of trouble--little wonder authors of web mail applications don't
want to reinvent it.  I'd suggest investigating something like Dovecot,
which can read your mboxes and Maildir folders and present them as
IMAP--then your choices will open considerably.

While your at it, maybe you should try to make your SMTP service a
little more reliable:
$ mailq|grep -c pem at nellump

I've been using a Kinesis Ergo Advantage usb contoured keyboard for
the last 18 months or so (aside from laptop hours, which aren't
negligible).  It was an expensive keyboard (~$300) but *well* worth
it.  I spend 12-18 hours a day typing, and I have never felt any hand
/ wrist pain / strain while using it.  The version I have didn't come
with a dvorak legend, (because I got a black one.. you can get a white
one with the legend for the same price).  The keyboard does do
QWERTY/dvorak switching on the fly, and all the remapping is done in
hardware on the keyboard.  You can also record some crazy number of
macros (like 48 or 64?) as well as remap the entire keyboard manually
if you want.

This is a funky split-concave keyboard, and the space / enter / delete
and backspace (as well as a few other keys) are all thumb-operated by
default.  The keyboard also does not have a separate numeric keypad --
it is embedded as on a laptop keyboard.  There are two usb ports as
well as a connector for an optional foot switch on the back of the
keyboard, and ample space between the two key wells to mount a
trackpad between your hands, if you like that sort of thing.  (I wish
it had a trackpoint or two, but a logitech trackball works well with
it too.)

The thumb-key layout took some getting used to, as did the concave key
wells, but after about 12 hours on it I was no longer hampered by the
learning curve.

FWIW, when I ordered mine, I was able to get a 10% student discount (I
called to see if there was such a discount, and they gave me
directions for placing the order on line--the discount wasn't
advertised.)

I've just started using Scribus to make a memory book for my Mom's 70th birthday.
What about changing the font of text doens't work?

If you want to talk about maintaining color balance of embedded TIFF files when
you export to PDF...that's a problem I've (at least partly) solved.

Have you tried the Scribus IRC channel?  They were very helpful when I visited,
even when they didn't know the answer.

Michael,

   Nothing now. I made an unwarranted assumption, but the folks on the mail
list got me straighted out just fine.

   Er, no. I'm not there yet. I'm working with jpg images and I'll have to see
how they do for now. Right now I'm going to search for instructions on adding
additional fonts that are on the system so they're seen by Scribus.

   So far I really like it for page layout duties. So, I'm up to five writing
tools now. :-) Too bad I'm not a graphic designer/artist. I'd probably do a
lot better with this stuff if I was.

Any USB mouse should work just fine.  I use a Kensington Pocket Mouse Pro.  
It is an optical with a retractable cord.  Works fine, but sometimes the 
cord gets in the way.

Depends on what you like and how big your hands are, I guess.

I so hate touchpads. One of the reasons I bought my Compaq 
laptop instead of other brands is that the touchpad has an on-off 
switch. On booting the driver is loaded, so if I am away from home 
and discover I forgot my mouse at home I can just turn on the 
touchpad.

I have a Logitech cordless optical mouse that I got at Fry's. The 
receiver has no cord to get in the way. It's just a little stick that you 
put into a USB port. Most people think it is a USB memory stick, 
because that's what it looks like. Even comes with a little fabric 
case to hold the mouse and stick. Loaded with the two AA 
batteries it weighs only a few ounces. I just replaced the batteries 
for the first time after using it for about six months, but I'm always 
careful to use the little switch on the bottom to turn it off when not 
using it.

I have fiddled with it, but not enough to be any kind of expert, or 
even a regular user.

Formatting text is one of the things I don't like about it because it's 
just about impossible in the frame. You have to open the story 
editor, but then you lose the GUI.

But otherwise it is pretty good. And development is moving along 
very rapidly. I'm pinning a lot of hope on it for the future.

Epsons are currently the favored line.  Probably make the purchase at Best Buy.

OK. Here's the deal. Color inkjet printing is the cause of more woes and 
unhappiness on Linux than anything else. So I wrote a couple articles on the 
subject to help folks. Short version: buy the right printer and you're 
golden. Buy the wrong one and you're in for an expensive bad time. Samsung 
and HP support Linux best of all. 

Epson dye-based inks clog printer heads and cost you mega-monies, though they 
are gorgeous when they deign to work right. Canon hates Linux, but the 
TurboPrint drivers work great, and Canons are good print quality and 
reasonably economical.

http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/nethub/article.php/3574866
http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/nethub/article.php/3576576

I just ran into an issue with Ubuntu Breezy where the default installation of 
CUPS does not see the Gutenprint drivers. Now really- doesn't anyone do even 
a rudimentary test to see if things work before releasing them? 

Anyway, you can get good color printing on Linux, you just have to do your 
homework before purchasing a printer.

Please note how I am not saying bad things about Best Buy. Though I want 
to. :)

Hey, I'm getting ready to buy one too (my last one was an

John,

   There are two ways of editing and formatting text: using the built-in
storyboard editor or something like OpenOffice.org Writer. I've no idea what
GUI you lose in the storyboard editor, that's just a complex dialog box with
a multi-line text entry widget. In the text frames I've created I've typed the
text, then highlighted it and applied the attributes I want. Now I'll go back
and learn how to make paragraph styles so I can use those.

   For my immediate purposes, it's there already.

I really wish webpine was released to the general public, that would rock

SquirrelMail is probably the one of if not the best system you're going to

Subject: [PLUG] Thinkpad T30, Dock & DVI
Message-ID: <BDB4F6D5C05AB5E08E9524AF@[10.23.5.13]>

I've got my (Linux) T30 mostly working in the dock, but I've been 
unable to drive the DVI port on the dock.  Analog external video works, 
but no signal on the DVI port.  This is one of the lucky T30 models 
that freezes with a PCI video card in the dock, so I'm stuck with the 
pass-through DVI.

Anyone seen this configuration working?  Seems like folks with T4x's 
don't have any issues, nor do most T30 owners.  I've seen reference to 
a utility called 'setdvi' which apparently turns on the port, but I 
can't find it anywhere.  Anyone heard of this tool?

This is a T30 2366-97U, and I think the dock is a Dock I.  Maybe II.

I also have issues with the pass-through USB ports.  They fire up for a 
second, there's some kernel negotiation then they fail.  I've worked 
around this with a PCI USB card, but maybe it's a related symptom.

Thanks,
Jason

A related question.. is it possible to drive two monitors with a
T-series laptop (a T42p, specifically) in a dock of some sort, with
out using the LCD on the laptop?  This is the only thing stopping me
from ditching my desktop entirely -- I want a dual monitor system,
where both monitors are stand-alone (eg: both CRTs in my current
setup).

Thanks,

Thanks for pointing me at that Rich, but I think I'll stick with
GraphViz; it only took a couple minutes to learn and was good enough for
what I wanted to do and could output directly into the image format I
wanted.

I originally wanted directed graph renderer suggestions because I wrote
a little web crawler to map the progress of a meme through a bunch of
blogs and wanted to visualize it; it was primarily for my own curiosity
rather than a task that I had to complete for others so I wanted
something quick, easy, and "good enough".

Subject: [PLUG] Color Ink-Jet Printers
Message-ID: <43DFD513.70509@wbcable.net>

Hey Michael...

I think a good question to ask of you would be:
/What is the purpose of this Epson printer?/

If it is your "Once-In-A-While" photo printer, then your cheap 
<http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=7384877&type=product&productCategoryId=pcmcat42100050004&id=1122654460189>Epson 
R340 will do. Unfortunately this has a combo color ink cartrige which is 
a pet peave of mine; however, it does support multiple memory cards and 
does a high resolution printing.

If you're looking for more along the lines of the semi-professional then 
I would probably go with the the Epson R1800;  which does give you 
multiple ink cartriges.  Another advantage is that you can print LARGE 
prints. 13x44 with rolled paper sounds like fun for banners, but nothing 
else really is practical with that since the paper quality is regular 
paper.

Now that I've said about the Epson line ('cause that's what he asked 
for); I'm going to say my peace about them. HP and Epson are both 
expensive with their inks. Many HP new cartridges are $24 to $30, while 
Epson's range from $15 to $30 a new cartridge.  My Canon printer 
cartridges cost about $10 new. Yip, HP and Epson are double the costs!! 
Why? Mostly name brand issues for HP, and Epson has unique inks for 
archival purposes. (Honestly I'm not going to live the 200 years to find 
out if they really do last 200 years; which is what Epson says.)

Another issue that has cropped up is that with the increased technology 
the definition of what consittutes "BLACK" has become even more rigid. 
All three (Canon, HP, and Epson) increasingly use colors to constitute 
the correct shade of the darker side of the colors. This means that the 
really cool picture of a concert will burn through lots of ink because 
it really isn't "BLACK", but it's many different colors combined.

Realistically  I would look these items in a color printer these days:
(My usage rate per month is around 1 13x19-print, 20  8.5x11-prints,  
and 15 4x6-prints)
(Printing pictures for my kids' teachers of subjects they are working on.)
1. High DPI
2. 1 Color = 1 Cartridge
3. OS Compatibility
4. Network Aware
5. Low Cartridge Costs
6. Large format Capability.

If you have any questions please zip me an e-mail at pmvw ( at ) wbcable.net

Subject: [PLUG] smaller icons in gnome menus
Message-ID: <20060131230034.GA28325@gate.kl-ic.com>


I am experimenting with SUSE 10, using a SUSE-modified Gnome 2.12.0 .
The menu uses large icons, which is annoying and wastes screen space. 
How do I make the icons small - or nonexistent - in the Gnome menu?
Keeping in mind that SUSE may have left something out in the menus -
I don't mind editing .gnome files if some GUI tool is missing.

My Logitech cordless optical (you would think they would put a model 
number on this thing so I could tell my friends to go buy one -- 
anyway, it was about $40 and uses a higher wireless frequency plus has 
a wheel that rocks from side to side (though I haven't gotten that 
rocking bit to work on Linux)) has a receiver that snaps into the 
bottom which also acts as the on/off switch.  Snaps in pretty securely, 
so I haven't worried about that snapping bit wearing out or the 
receiver getting lost.

I've had it for about a month and it seems to work well enough.  I do 
have to Ctrl+Alt+F1,Alt+F7 to get it recognized if I plug it in after 
starting X, but that's probably something to do with the laptop and/or 
my X setup.

Sounds like the V200 which I recommended previously. Definitely my favorite laptop mouse of all time.

Neither have I, but I haven't tried. I'd guess the rocking is recognized the same way the side buttons on 5-button mice are. I'm sure there's a way.

I can't say I'm an expert with X, but on Gentoo the hotplug system handles input device hotplugging for me, no need to switch virtual terminals or restart X, it just works. As soon as it's connected the peripherals are usable.

I took a deep breath and purchased the Logitech V200.
It works great.  Haven't tried plugging it in after X has started but thanks
for the tip on getting in going if it needs a little kick.
Thanks for all the info guys.  I think I'm on my way.

No, developers have security problems. The shortest path to a web app in
any language on any platform is insecure. You can write slow, fragile
and insecure code in any language. You can write robust and secure code
in most languages. But it requires planning and thought and experience.

Well, thank you all for the suggestions.  I still do not know what broke, but 
when I installed the system updates (about 2 weeks worth), a number of broken 
things began to work.  The updates are supposed to be security-related mostly, 
so I suspect that something was reset in the process.  I wish I knew what it was 
so that I do not get in this fix again.

I still have an issue with kmix. It may be missing some controls.

Thanks again.

There is always this thing:

http://www.artlebedev.com/portfolio/optimus/

Seems likely to offer dvorak keycaps...

Why do you need hardware remapping? Any OS will allow you to specify what
mapping to use. Usefully this will avoid killing portions of software
that depend on the physical layout (those parts can bypass the keymap).

In my case, I use (or have used) the same keyboard on 2-3 Linux boxes
(in X and console, with different window managers), a windows machine,
and an iBook.  All of these machines were often used by people who
required qwerty.

Each WM had it's own way of switching key layouts, only one of which
actually changed the layout globally, rather than for only the last
window focused.  Windows was the same way -- if you needed to change
the keymap from the default it meant changing the map every time your
window focus changed, *and* it meant doing the same thing again when
changing back.  OSX used a global map until 10.4, when it went the
annoying way as well.  A hardware keyboard eliminates this problem
entirely.  It also means that I can just have two keyboards plugged in
-- one does qwerty, one does dvorak.

This also means I don't have to figure out how to change the keylayout
in 7+ different situations (boot loaders, console on debian, console
on redhat, OSX, Windows, kde, gnome, other graphical environments....
etc.).

With a keyboard that supports remapping, I can also avoid the above
problems for swapping capslock / ctrl, and any other nuances.

The biggest benefit though, is just not having to mess with the
software.  It all works differently, and it isn't always available
(grub and lilo, to my knowledge, only do qwerty).  Having an extra
qwerty keyboard plugged in is also a huge plus if you pair program, or
have a sig. other who doesn't do dvorak :)

Yes.  Yes they are.  My C86 took a little tooling around with to get working, 
and ultimately I gave the USB cable to a friend who lost the one for his 
camera and bought a real printer cable and hooked it up with the good old 
reliable lp0 and it's worked flawlessly ever since.

On the other hand, most of the cost of an Epson printer is the print head, and 
they're relatively inexpensive make compared to the output they produce.  
While the ink refills are tricker to find than HP, they're less expensive.  
This is largely because HP inkjet printers have their print heads as a part 
of the cartridge (thus making the heads themselves a consumable that last 
only as long as the ink does by design).  Epson puts the print head into the 
printer, you just plug a new ink tank into the print head on the carriage.

Ubuntu has a long history of taking software from Debian Sid without 
additional testing it and calling it good (frequently without even changing 
the maintainer name, even if someone else supposedly maintains the kyped 
packages, so the Debian maintainers end up getting all the complaints from 
pissed Ubuntu users...).  

The same problem is present in Debian Sid, and I recall finding a workaround 
for that situation when I was setting up my printer.  However, I'd have to go 
back and find my notes from last fall to remember how I did it.

Always get the full warranty with them.  Sure, they'll sell you dodgy 
hardware, but at least this way, they replace it.  My girlfriend has had a 
brand new, top of the line every few weeks for the last year and a half now.  
First laptop, she took it in to get a glitch fixed while I was out of town 
and she was pressed against a deadline.  She missed her deadline, Best Buy 
gave her a crapload of points and replaced her new laptop with a nicer new 
laptop after the technician knocked a venti mocha into her first one.  Now, 
she realizes they're clumsy oafs.  So she goes back for the free stuff.  

Almost every time she's been back in, they've dropped her laptop, or set a 
heavy appliance on it, or otherwise mangled it beyond what a trained monkey 
can fix. The upside is they always replace it with a newer laptop and recover 
the data off the one they broke, and give her a bunch of best buy points.  I 
think she might be getting close to enough to pay off the laptop in points 
alone by now...

Short? Aw geez....

Okay, here's the shortest summary I can come up with:
1. User submitted data is insecure by nature.
2. PHP makes it really easy to do things with user submitted data.
3. PHP also runs (typically) in the UID of the web server, thus, if you 
have 50 users on one server, they all have the *exact* *same* *perms*.

Longer? Well, that's where the meat is. Let's look at perl tainting, 
variable types and scoping, and secure programming practices, and then 
perms.

First up at bat: Tainting.
In PHP, by default, a script can use:
<? if ($foo = "yes") { bar();} ?>

Perl, OTOH, is kind of protective, and will throw a warning depending 
on whether or not $foo comes from user-supplied data, or a server 
script. PHP often doesn't care. Of course, a savvy programmer will 
actually *check* where data is coming from, and *validate* the data 
used. Using register_globals can help a bit, as can making sure that 
all server variables are initialized (ahead of time) which are not 
user-supplied.

Next up: Variable types.
In client->server web programming, there is *no* *such* *thing* as a 
user-supplied int. Or a float. Anybody who tries to sell you a package 
based on such things is either deluded, or doesn't understand HTTP. All 
web text comes in as *strings*. Period. Programmers can *cast* that 
string data one way or another, but people used to concepts such as a 
float not being assigned a string value may be really alarmed when 
their assumed "int" or "float" turns out to be a string, which can make 
SQL injection quite easy.

Another swing at the issue: Variable scoping.
PHP, by default, is big on global vars. Very handy in some cases, very 
scary in others. People used to protected variables should *really* 
read the docs first. Rather than a model of "protected unless global", 
PHP often went with "global unless protected". (I once saw 11K users 
shut out because of this... not pretty).

And now, Secure programming practices.
This is a pet peeve of mine. Take variable "$foo=1". This can 
eventually make the var true/bool, a string, an int, a float, etc. If 
you are passing it though python, PHP, C, java, and whatever-else in 
the chain, each part of the chain needs to make sure that the data is 
within expected values, and that the value will not compromise the next 
part of the chain. Let's take a recent MySQL exploit, where a long 
string, passed by PHP, can create a string-format exploit with mysql.  
A programmer can limit the mysql_connect() (and subsequent arguments) 
to less than 1K (or even 256 bytes). Newbie programmers who don't 
expect attacks, and thus do not sanitize every variable used for a) 
size, b) casted data type, c) removing special (escape) characters, 
etc., get caught.

Finally: Perms.
PHP often runs as the apache (etc) user. If each user has an apache 
instance, for their *own* UID, this is not a problem. However, hosting 
sites often want to keep CPU load down, and thus, there is "one" PHP 
(aka web) user. This is where PHP's "safe mode" (which most PHP devs 
hate) comes in. "safe mode" is functionally about having ten trusted 
programmers on a home server. It doesn't work for 3K users on a box... 
they still have a sandbox to break out of, unless they each have their 
own webserver instance.

So, in conclusion, you asked how can a:
> "secure" PHP can be implemented

How can a secure C program be implemented on the server? You cannot 
make C secure anymore than PHP. What you *can* do is check if every C, 
or PHP program, is good. Lacking that, chroot each PHP user and 
webserver into their own box. This adds to CPU costs.
