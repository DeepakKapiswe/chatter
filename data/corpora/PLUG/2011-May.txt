According to this guy (http://www.storagesearch.com/ssdmyths-endurance.html) writing to a new 64GB ssd at max speed continuously would still require your app to run for 51 years before it would hit the ssd limit designed into the drive... and fall over. 

I'm not vouching for the information, I just found it.

There is truth to this, however modern drives have found solutions to this
problem. It's really a small concern any more.

An absolutely HIDEOUS release! And I say that as long time Ubuntu fan, 
converted from Windows  XP/Vista by Gutsy Gibbon

The Kubuntu (KDE 4.6) version is totally unusable for NVidia cards. 
Kubuntu installs in 640x480 video mode and refuses to allow the upgraded 
driver NVidia administrative module to save a higher resolution for 
subsequent sessions. Even worse, that higher resolution corrupts 
terminal displays, which eventually leak out into the entire display in 
what resembles that old analog  TV "snow". KDE panel and desktop 
functions are hopelessly crippled by this problem as well. This Kubuntu 
release is at best an alpha-2. Certainly not even a beta, much less an RC.

The Ubuntu (nee Gnome) version installer does not allow for keyboard 
input to define mount points for other partitions, forcing the user to 
edit the /etc/fstab file to accomplish that fundamental operation. 
That's fine for those of us who have some Linux-Unix experience but new 
users will be befuddled, then angered, then disgusted. The installation 
itself still has numerous bugs in the desktop, with little if any of the 
claimed performance improvement the switch to Unity was supposed to bring.

As for the Unity interface itself, who told Shuttleworth that adding a 
mouse click or keystroke to invoke an app was an improvement? If a user 
likes that silly little tattoo band running up the left side of their 
screen they can opt for a far more functional analogue by downloading 
the Avant panel, which offers far more utility, customization and 
stability.

Mark Shuttleworth should be ashamed to have this abortion bear the name 
of an official Ubuntu product. Natty is a grotesquely classic case of 
fixing what was not broken, a pervasive philosophical weakness that the 
Ubuntu team has shown before, when adding then crippling than removing 
desirable features for no apparent reason other than programmer ego.

This ugly "release" has led me to take another look at viable 
Debian-based alternatives such as Mint and Mepis. Maverick (Ubuntu 
10.10) with Gnome works very well for me but if Natty is the direction 
Shuttleworth is taking, I don't want to be forced to use outdated OS 
software or live with a bug-infested freakish exercise in geek 
ego-tripping.

I didn't do the math recently, but around a year ago when i did it was
something like that--ridiculously improbable that you'd still be using
the media by the time it failed (though i still have some 15 year old
hard drives, i haven't used any of them in at least 10 years...and no
longer have a computer with the appropriate ancient scsi connector to
do so if i wanted to.)

first off, the drives are pretty smart about spreading writes around
the drive rather than leaving hotspots pinned to a certain sector.
but even if it is pinned to a spot that exceeds the write limit, these
drives also typically have some reserved percentage above their listed
capacity to migrate failing sectors to, and they notice the failure
when it happens and do so automatically under the hood so you don't
even ever become affected by it, except that maybe the write takes an
extra few milliseconds to complete.

That is sad to hear.  I have never had issue with Mint, and have preferred it to Ubuntu since 8.04 or so.  although these days Im a solid arch user.

I think Shuttleworth needs to do some primary research. I suspect he
has embraced Unity, partly because it solves some problems with X, but
overwhelmingly because he thinks that it will be more enticing and
easier to use for desktop users, particularly those coming from Windows.

Is that true? I don't know the answer, but it would be relatively easy
to discover. An in-depth study of the reactions and problems
of new desktop users, comparing Unity, Gnome, KDE, and a few others,
would be very revealing. 

I won't speculate as to the outcome. I only wish to point out that
without some scientific evidence, everything that people say pro and
con Unity is wild ass speculation. Whether you or I personally like it
or not is irrelevant. Ubuntu's goal is to make Linux usable on the
desktop for newcomers to Linux. Those users are the ones whose opinion
matters.

Maybe the Ubuntu team has already done this research. I doubt it, but
if they have it would be interesting to find a link to it.

I have been using Kubuntu 11.04 since Alpha 2 and have had almost no
problems at all.  Are you saying that the installer is at 640x480 with
Nvidia or is that after the install is done and you boot into it for the
first time?  I'll give it a go on my system and see what happens.  If it is
at the first boot, is it using the nouveau driver or the proprietary Nvidia
driver?

I just got back from Linuxfest NorthWest and I spoke with quite a few people
about this. Almost all of them dislike Unity.  It is about the same as when
KDE went from 3 to 4... everyone hated it, but now that it has matured a
bit, it is an excellent desktop.  The little bit of playing I did with
Unity, reminded me heavily of OS X.  Not very customizable, but easy so long
as you want to do basic tasks.  I think this will appeal to a lot of people
who have no prior experience with Linux, but likely to turn veteran users
away.  Only time will tell...

The installer had the correct resolution, possibly because I edited the 
boot-loader menu with the vga=795 command line addition. However, the 
installation came up  640x480 with 320x240 as the only option, 
regardless of  any  command line edits. I managed to download and 
install the latest NVidia driver. Not that it did much good. It allowed 
me to adjust the resolution to what I used in prior Ubuntu/Kubuntu 
installations but didn't allow saving that configuration for subsequent 
sessions. The "save" dialogue appeared but did not allow saving the Xorg 
config file. Even invoking nvidia-settings as root did not help.

That meant I'd be forced to re-adjust back from the standard 640x480 
each session. Not impossible of course, but a pitiful step backward from 
the easy NVidia configuration of Jaunty Lucid and Maverick. Even then, 
the display was corrupted when I invoked KDE's konsole app, perhaps 
because I had reconfigured the font size.

I could hack all this. I could install (as root) a prior xorg config 
file which had the appropriate resolutions that I generated in Mepis 
8.0. I could edit the fstab file to set up my preferred mount points. 
But why bother? Those fundamental mechanisms, as well as the numerous 
desktop bugs in Unity, should be fully operative in the installation of 
any respectable release. Shuttleworth will sure alienate any potential 
convert from Windows7 with this ungodly mess, and for what purpose?

Worse, the rumor is that the next Ubuntu release will abandon the 
"classic" (i.e., Gnome-like) interface altogether, leaving Unity as the 
only desktop. Beyond that, Shuttleworth is allegedly planning to replace 
X with something called Wayland. Given the hideously botched disaster he 
produced with the switch away from Gnome, one can only imagine what an 
entirely new graphics engine will look like coming from that team.

I give Shuttleworth great credit for bringing Linux to the average 
desktop user wanting something more than Windows. Too bad he couldn't 
rein in his ego long enough to perfect what he had  produced, instead of 
wandering off to create something nobody was asking for in a package 
that doesn't even work as well as a sophomore programming class project.

I am listening to all the chatter..

I am running Lucid and guess I will just continue.

It works fine and updates once a week.

I run Maverick (Ubuntu 10.10) w/Gnome and the Avant panel. It is 
absolutely perfect in every aspect, so far superior to Windows I would 
not run W7 even if it were free.  I use some KDE apps like the K3B 
burner and I even ran the pre-release Gnome3/Gnome shell with not one 
problem. Fast, totally bug free.

I wanted to sample the new Libre Office, Grub upgrade  and KDE 4.6 with 
the  new Qt 4.7 but this mess of U/11.4 is not worth the hassle. I'll 
wait to see what  Mepis 11.0 and/or Mint looks like.

If the folks at Ubuntu, Gnome, KDE, et al. are truly interested in
bringing Linux to the masses than this is
what needs to happen. I just participated in a bunch of thread posts
on LinkedIn about why more companies
don't use Linux. Many people cited usability.

 I totally agree, desktop usability is completely about the opinion of
new users and not people who've run many different distros and
desktop / X-Windows.

To the best of my knowledge, Ubuntu really seems to be driving the
"average jane desktop user" development. If we
all want to see the Linux community grow than this work needs to
happen. Historically, desktop usability has
not received a lot of care and attention as most developers wanted to
work on the kernel, drivers, etc.
Which needed to be done. What's the point of worrying about how the
dashboard in your car looks / feels if the engine keeps stalling
and the tires fall off.

Maybe this is a sign of Linux's maturity?

When I worked in Silicon Valley, it wasn't uncommon for the developers
of new sw apps to sit out on the street with a
few laptops with their app running so random people could check it and
provide impromptu feedback. Studies are good, but I think
you also need to let people just play around with it and get their
uncensored / unstudied opinion while they're using it.

The reality is that MS & Apple have captured the minds of the avg
computer user in the U.S. as to how to a GUI should work. If you hope
to
bring some of these people over to Linux, you're going to have to make
your UI similar enough to MS / Apple to make it easy for people to
change over.

Yes, I despised KDE 4 for the first few revisions. I don't think it
was until 4.4 or so that
it became tolerable for me.

IMHO the way Linux should work is that you should be able to run your
preferred desktop, X-window system on
your favorite distro. If you're truly a veteran user, you should be
capable of pulling that off without too many bumps
and wrinkles. I say should because I've tried running a few different
X-Window Managers a few times without much look.
Granted my troubles were mostly due to my ignorance of said X-win
mgrs. and my lack of interest and time to
make them as or more usable for me than the default desktop such as KDE / Gnome.

I've never like the way any version of Ubuntu has functioned or
performed on my T60, so
I'm happy I've been able to run straight Debian Sid w. KDE-light for a
few years now with the only
bump in the road being the transition from KDE 3 to 4.

It sounds like Russell nailed it when he said "Shuttleworth seems to
be taking things in the
wrong direction". This could really suck for a large portion of the
Linux community...

Therein lies the rub.

Either the OS is designed for newcomers or Linux or veteran users.

Right now Natty seems totally hostile to the former while a pain in the 
backside from at least some veteran users. I'm no MS/CS sys-admin but 
I'm not a Linux or Ubuntu newbie either. I love the ease of installation 
and  slick operation of Jaunty-Lucid-Maverick as well as the Linux 
power. Natty has the power of the underlying Linux system with none of 
the convenience of its recent predecessors.

  I'm still trying to work through Natty's shortcomings (in Gnome; I've 
totally forsaken its hopelessly botched KDE implementation) but as yet I 
fail to see anything in Natty that  isn't done as well or better by 
Jaunty-Lucid-Maverick. An extra mouse stroke to invoke an app is not an 
improvement in my book and I don't think Windows users will see that as 
one.

Maybe Shuttleworth's Ubuntu is like any other empire that grew too 
powerful too quickly.  Ubuntu lost sight of achieving worthy desirable 
goals and chose instead to do whatever it wanted regardless of what was 
desirable, simple because it had the power to do so.

So you conclude that a distro can't meet the needs of more than one of
these groups?

Your opinions are completely valid, but only for you. I'd rather see
some hard research. See below.

No comment here. I have not tried Natty yet, and have no plans to do
so. Not because of negative comments such as yours; rather, I just
don't have the time or need.

Assuming that Natty is as awful as you opine, do you really think it
was deliberate? Or was it just a bunch of bad ideas?

I'm with Mike on this one.

Here is an off-the-cuff idea for a research project. I spent all of
ten minutes cooking this up, so it doubtless needs a lot of tweaking.

Take at least two hundred users in each of several categories, e.g.,
Linux newbies coming from Windows, Linux newbies coming from MacOS,
Linux veterans, etc. Keep data on age and at least self-proclaimed
computer literacy levels.

Give half of them Natty and half of them Maverick. Make each user work
alone at home so none sees what any of the others are doing. Give them
specific user type tasks, such as "write a letter to a potential
employer," "write a term paper for school," "find the meanings of terms
on wikipedia," and so on. Include computer type tasks like "move a file
from one folder to another," "make a backup," and such. Make enough
tasks that it will take them 30 hours or more working with the OS. You
may wish to start them all with the task of installing the OS. 

Make pointed opinion questionnaires to complete at the end of each task,
where the results are numerical so they can be quantified. 

Quantify and compare the results. Send a copy to Shuttleworth.

I think that's actually a fairly decent UI functionality test. In
addition, the computers also
could be set up to do a video screen cap to record all the mouse
movements and keyboard strokes. That
way you'd really know how intuitive it is for the user to move around
in the UI and how many keyboard strokes
and mouse clicks it takes to do each task.

Of course, by the sound of other people's opinions of how Shuttleworth
is running things, he probably
wouldn't care too much about all that data.

thanks, John and Mike, for keeping a positive tone.

i usually wait at least a month before installing the latest Ubuntu 
release, but this time around i'm sticking with 10.10 because it's 
really stable, i've heavily customized my day-to-day machines, and 11.04 
is a big UI shift that requires a fair amount of work by apps to 
integrate well (as far as i can tell from following the official 
announcements, news, and blogs). Plans for 11.10 could change 
dramatically depending on community feedback, at least i hope.

And, when i finally get around to trying it, i may like it. If not, the 
Fedora (the most-used *ix at my workplace) user experience seems to have 
improved a great deal since i last tried using it almost five years ago, 
and would probably be my next choice.

I've wanted to like and use Fedora many times. But I'm I have an
unfavorable opinion of
RPM based distros. I find their package mgmt systems a bit trickier to
work with. I wanted to like OpenSuse too
as a lot of people spoke highly of it too. But I never could get
either of them work as smoothly and painlessly
as Debian. Fedora on my T60 performed horrendously. It wouldn't boot,
it would lock up, it was really slow. OpenSuse worked better, but if
memory serves I had some difficulties installing and running some apps
that I commonly use like Synergy and a few others.

It's interesting to me the wide disparity of functionality /
performance differences between distros on the same hardware.

While I do not have much experience installing on many laptops, I can speak to Redhat/CentOS/Fedora. 

I shy away from Fedora, just as I shy away from a .0 release of most software. Fedora is, as Redhat puts it, The community, bleeding edge distribution. I read that as, "We test things here. Don't expect everything to work." Some have very good luck with it. I choose to not put myself in that position. I need my computer to work, for work.

CentOS, on the other hand, is RHEL, without any of the RedHat proprietary stuff. It should be, and in my experience is, very stable. I've installed it on various hardware without issue. The CentOS team takes the RHEL open source tree, and reconstitutes it. 

RPM has it's issues. So does dpkg/apt-get. So does the windows registry. All can be worked around. 

All OSes suck. Some just suck worse than others. :)

   I've read the emacs manual on the speedbar without seeing an answer to my
question: why don't .sql files display when I'm editing such a file?

   I've used speedbar when editing .py and .c files, but it does not display
.sql or .txt files in the same directory as that of the active buffer. I'd
appreciate a clue stick on what I'm missing.

The right-click menu in the speedbar has an option "Show all files",
and there is a customize option:

Speedbar Show Unknown Files:
   Non-nil show files we can't expand with a ? in the expand button.
Hide Rest
   A nil value means don't show the file in the list.

There is also a list of supported extensions:

"Speedbar Supported Extension Expressions"

You could add .txt and .sql to that, I suspect it will then do what
you want. (although speedbar's file-specific features, like expanding
files, probably won't work well, if at all, on those).

   I added the two extensions. Most of these customization options are
totally opaque to me, but I don't live in emacs all day. :-) Heck, I don't
know why I'd want the speedbar to expand files, either. I thought that was
my job.

Sometimes I think I live in emacs simply because my fingers no longer
know how to operate the doors to any other editor.  I certainly can't
turn on the lights once I get inside.

Clicking on the file icon in the speedbar will often expand the file
in the speedbar tree so you can jump to points of interest in the
file.  This works great for some formats (like org-mode files) and not
so great for others (like Java source).

   Oh, that's right. I've used this with python files. But, it's been a while
and my SQL DDL files are quite small.

Thanks,

It would appear my problems with Natty are the result of doing an "upgrade".
When I do a full install I do not have the problems I mentioned before.

Yes, I've run CentOS on work machines for test boxes and I don't
recall having any serious issues with it that were show stoppers.

Yes, many flavors of distro, desktop/window mngrs, and pkg mngrs. I
get all of that and the ensuing philosophies. I was just merely
expressing my personal experiences with a few of them and
how that led me to what I run today.

Update on Ubuntu 11.4 install


Regarding my previous fine whines about the bugs in the latest Ubuntu 
release, Natty 11.4, out of fairness I felt I should present my 
subsequent experiences with the Unity desktop version.

The display bugs and performance disappointments I encountered upon 
first install have been extinguished with a week's worth of Ubuntu 
updates. The one remaining snag, not being able to define alternate 
mount points in the installer, is a major one for novices, but obviously 
cannot be remedied without an entire new release .iso.


Now that Natty seems to have settled down, apparently it does deliver 
performance superior to its predecessors. Whether due to the new 
compiz-based graphics instead of mutter or some other change I can't say 
but display speed is noticeably improved with Unity. Ubuntu forums seem 
to indicate problems with Natty "Classic" (the old Gnome-ish interface) 
but at least Unity delivers on its promise of speed.


Also, possibly related, I've found that Natty's LibreOffice loads its 
initial invocation much faster than OpenOffice. So much so that I've 
abandoned GEdit Geany and Kate and use Libre Office Writer for all my 
work, text as well as word processing and HTML; it's really just as fast 
and clean as GEdit. That alone justifies the switch to 11.4 for me. The 
new Unity side panel still takes some getting used to but at least it 
works as advertised now, my old favorite Avant panel coexists perfectly 
with it and the improved Natty graphics makes the Unity app menu as fast 
as the old Gnome-panel, even with the extra mouse click.

I hadn't noticed much of a speed increase, but I haven't found anything that
worked slow enough to stand out, either. I've been pretty happy with it.

I wanted to wait until I had spent enough time with it to get a better
impression, but overall I'm very happy with it. I *LIKE* that it got rid of
some of the bars on top and bottom that were valuable space to me. The
pop-up menu bar and having the launcher on the side are both great
improvements, in my book. I have a widescreen monitor, and vertical space is
much more crowded. Having the launcher on the side uses a part of the screen
that normally gets much less use on my computer than most of it. I'm loving
the difference. I think that Ubuntu is going in a good direction - I can
still get to low level stuff if I need to, but so far everything has worked
so well out of the box that I haven't had to do much command line. It's
still been easy to get to for the couple of things I've needed.

Short story - I'm sold on it.

Erik

I'm not a big fan of the new "landscape" monitors. I use an older 4:3 20 
inch LCD because I like the vertical space for text reading/writing 
work. I dread the day it gives out because only the band-aid form-factor 
monitors seem to be available now. They don't deliver the vertical size 
I like without going into something like a 27 inch or larger, a 
seriously spendy proposition. The 16:9 monitor may be great for watching 
movies online or for HD gamers but that's what I have a TV for; a 4:3 
form-factor makes more sense for my desktop PS use.

I can see where the Unity interface is well suited for the 16:9 style 
though. There really isn't much else to do with that extra space on the 
left (unless one has a LOT of desktop icons) so moving a panel from top 
to side is logical. Unity seems to be working out as it was intended and 
the rest of Ubuntu 11.4 has settled down to the point where I can rely 
on it.

There used to be monitors that could be rotated 90 degrees. Do they 
still make those? Would that solve your problem?

I'm pretty sure HP still makes those. I don't know if there are Linux
drivers for their monitors (the rotation part, that is.)

What's really cool about the widescreen monitors is that you can have two pages, side by side on them.

In addition, mine does rotate 90 degrees, so I can get a whole 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper displayed on my screen. I've done that with both 4:3 and widescreen monitors, and it's definitely better with the widescreen. Also, many of the 27" wide monitors are about the same cost as the older 20" 4:3s. That's actually more real estate.

Well, it's hard to say what will be available when it comes time to
replace your 4:3 20" LCD monitor.

But for now there appears to still be a few 4:3 monitors, and a 5:4
which I got my eye on, avail by HP, Viewsonic, Dell, LG on Pricewatch,
pacificgeek, tigerdirect
at some pretty good prices. I also think there'll be a pretty good
used market as people unload their older unwanted 3:4 monitors
off in favor of the new widescreen. Besides who uses a computer for
anything other than watching videos... :-(

xrandr handles rotations just fine (as does at least one of the gnome
xrandr font-ends).  Gnome settings even has an option for switching
the RGB orientation for sub-pixel rendering.

I tried this for a while. While it was great to have a vertical 16x9
monitor, the viewing angles were clearly not designed for that
orientation.  It was pretty much impossible to see colors the same
across the entire height of the monitor, and left-right viewing was
non-uniform (there was a higher viewing angle in one direction than
the other, I don't recall which was which).  In some situations, text
or widgets would "disappear" because the viewing angle was just far
enough off (the color would appear distorted enough that things would
blend into the background--move your head up a few inches and you'd be
able to see that portion, while loosing detail where you were looking
before).

There *is* clearly a difference in quality between monitors, because
the tablets I've used haven't had these viewing issues when rotated --
but it's something to pay attention to if you're buying a desktop LCD
with the intention of rotating it.

My flat panel, a Samsung SMB2330, has a feature called "MagicAngle"
which helps me greatly because my desk actually was designed for old
CRTs (I have a grand old desk) and thus, the screen is a bit high for
normal flat panels. The "MagicAngle" feature does some wizardry
(honestly, it just seems to adjust the brightness/contrast- but I'll
admit I haven't researched what it's really doing) to make the screen
viewable at non-standard angles.

The reason I bring this up is because I had noticed before that one of
the settings it had was something called "Side Mode":
* http://i.imgur.com/PLaNP.jpg

which helps with side-view angles... which I would imagine would help
if you needed a flat-panel that had to be rotated and, as others have
pointed out, didn't want a viewing penalty for doing so.

The *big* problem, however, is that my monitor has *no* way to
actually mount it sideways. Like most flat-panels out there, it's got
one of these irritating stands that are built with the assumption that
you want to view it *only* in landscape mode. Personally, I'm fine
with that, but I'd still like to have the option.

As a test (FOR SCIENCE!!!) I configured my X.org and rotated my screen
with the "Side Mode" setting to see if it was usable:
* http://i.imgur.com/k3OCa.jpg

Turns out, it is actually quite nice. It's a bit skinny for my tastes,
and obviously without any way to mount it I wouldn't want to use it
this way (I mean, you can clearly see my hand in the photo :-) But the
"Side Mode" did make it viewable when rotated 90 degrees and I could
easily see myself using it that way if I maybe had two of them side by
side (twinview vertical flat-panels that were viewable like this would
be really nice :-)

Anyway... just a data point for anyone interested.

When that older 4:3 aspect ratio 20-inch LCD monitor fails, you can try
giving this guy a call: 503-860-8268. I can't read his name on the slip
but he sometimes can fix old monitors. depending on what you can afford.

I have an old Hitachi 751 19-inch monitor that does 1600x1200 just fine
but it gave out about a year ago. The gentleman at the above number was
able to replace a few capacitors, readjust it and get it working again,
and it's been rock solid ever since while running 24/7 in constant use.

Another monitor I got at Free Geek for $20 while the Hitachi was in the
shop went out later, but I wasn't willing to spend more than $50 to get
it fixed, which he couldn't do so I ended up giving it to him for parts.

There are 16:10 aspect ratio LCD monitors but you have to look for them
and yes, they're expensive.

HTH,
Robert

Subject: [PLUG] question for correct bash syntax for the test -e file command
Message-ID: <BANLkTikfpnLFDsc9CEmY5eCrBH9A7Py=SA@mail.gmail.com>

What is the correct syntax for the following simple bash script test command
on (1) when using the wild card character * to match?

I have a set of files, and simply want the test to locate at least one file,
but the wild card * asterisk character seems to mess up the test command by
finding too many matches.

(1)   if test -e m* ; then echo "found" ; fi

If I write

(2) if test -e `ls m* | head -1` ; then echo "found"; fi

and don't have any files matching m*, the bash script executes, finds
nothing (as expected) but gets a success on the 'ls m* | head -1` script
execution and then echos "found"

How is the bash script written correctly so it will echo found if any m*
files exist?

Thanks

Randall

The ls stands in for the -e test:
 
FILE_THERE=`ls m* 2>/dev/null | head -1`
if [  $FILE_THERE ];
then
    echo found $FILE_THERE 
fi

Michael's solution does work, and you can put it all on a single line:

FILE_THERE=`ls m* 2>/dev/null | head -1` ; [ -e $FILE_THERE ] && echo 
"found"

If it finds one then it reports and exits.

Of course, it also reports success for directories and recursively. This 
might be better:

FILE_THERE=`find m* -maxdepth 0 2>/dev/null | head -1` ; [ -e 
$FILE_THERE ] && echo "found"

I fervently agree with the 4:3 minority, but there are many who
agree with the screen marketing departments instead.  The reason
for the disappearance of 4:3 screens is that manufacturing has
gotten good enough that they can make two 16:9 screens out of
one very large blank.  The job of marketing departments is to
convince people to buy what is cheap to make.  Our waistlines
grow and our intelligence shrinks.

As manufacturing continues to improve, they will be able to
make slightly larger blanks, capable of two 16:12 or even
"16:12.8" (aka 5:4 ) screens.  Then the marketing departments
will try to sell all of us full-sized screens again, and
convince us to discard our band-aid aka runt screens.  Until
that happy day, I am stockpiling 4:3 screens, including
replacement screens for my laptop.

When this change happens, I will do my best not to say
"I told you so", as the formerly young defenders of "wide
screens", now middle aged, fight a losing battle against
the young turks pushing new screen technologies (and no
doubt even smaller fonts).  Watching the young become middle
aged is one of the most amusing parts of getting old.

I'm not making this up - some of us are old enough to have
used computers like the Tandy 100/102/200, the Apple Macintosh
Portable M5120, etc.  Those were wide, and small.  20 years
ago, full-sized screens replaced the previously common wide
screens.  Plus ?a change, plus c'est la m?me chose.

Regards viewing "2 up" pages, and given the usual top/bottom
placement of tool bars by apps, screen space is optimized on
a 4:3 screen.  See these screen captures:

http://www.keithl.com/twopage2048x1152.png   (16:9 aka wide)
http://www.keithl.com/twopage2048x1536.png   (16:12 aka 4:3)

For the few of us who /write/ documents, a tallscreen (say 3:4) is
even better, though I'm not sure how that would fit on a laptop.

Oh well.  The world spent two trillion hours watching television
last year, while Wikipedia represents 100 million hours of 
creative effort, 20,000 times less.  Perhaps when more people
become creative, more tools will be available for creation in
addition to the abundant tools available for consumption.

Keith

P.S.: for those stockpiling like me, be aware that fluorescent
backlights age and get dimmer with time.  Overdriven LEDs will
do the same, but backlights with sufficient LEDs at conservative
drive levels will last a long time.   Also, some companies (like
Dell) have widely varying product quality and durability - be
sure to google the particular used model you plan to buy, and
learn what experiences others have had.

For me, it is much less about aspect ratio or physical dimensions than
it is about the number of pixels.  The newer models are giving you
*fewer* pixels (in particular, vertically) than they used to while
they blather on with their marketing distractions.

How do you figure?

The typical 20" 4:3 monitor would have a native resolution of 1280x1024.

Normally, you would replace that with a 22" 16:9 monitor.

The typical 22" 16:9 monitor would have a native resolution of 1680x1050.

All I want is something I can look at and not get a headache while doing so.

Actually... not to be a nit-picker, but...

1680x1050 is a 16:10 aspect ratio (which was pretty standard on widescreens
a couple/few years ago)... but now the world has moved mostly to 16:9 (so
that most all displays - TV and computer are the same, since widescreen TV's
have pretty much always been 16:9). A typical 22" 16:9 resolution would be
1920x1080.

Also... for the record... 1280x1024 is actually one of those 5:4 aspect
ratios mentioned earlier in the thread... but... and I've never actually
measured (so I really don't know)... they MIGHT space the pixels differently
in one direction than the other so that it will fit a 4:3 panel. Does anyone
know if this is the case?

I agree that I prefer the 4:3 (or 5:4) displays over the widescreens AT THE
SAME PRICE POINT... but, if I can afford it... I'd rather have a 24"
widescreen than a 19" 4:3/5:4. Those two monitors will be roughly the same
screen height... but the widescreen has more real estate and slightly more
vertical pixels.

Sometimes I wonder how different things would be today if we had taken a
different path in developing electronic display technology. The original
Cathod Ray Tube and its immediate descendants (oscilloscopes and RADAR
screens) are round. A round display might have been a good thing. With
pixels packed hexagonaly it would lend itself to smoother anti-aliasing and
color blending because the pixels would be spaced evenly from each other. A
round display would have a number of other interesting properties too in
terms of bit-mapping and indexing.  Round screens might have inspired the
makers of a certain OS from Redmond, WA to have named their product 
"Bubbles" instead. (So would that make their users Bubble-heads?)

Or the engineers who design these ugly screens that just look wrong could
learn a lesson from the ancient Greeks and use a proportion that doesn't
give a human headaches to look at. One of the most aesthetically pleasing
ratios of width to height in Greek design (which can be seen in the
Parthenon and other classical Greek architecture) is the so-called Divine
Proportion or (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2, or about 8:5. This number shows up in
geometry and Nature so much that the Greeks were convinced it was a hint
from the gods pointing out something built into the design of things.

It is too bad that so much technolgical development is driven only by cost
and profit.

Memory incontinence from the ancient curmudgeon:

Back when we were designing the dinosaurs (BEFORE they roamed the 
earth) at Tektronix we made storage CRTs - the screen was the memory,
one color, binary, but infinitely addressable in theory, electron
optics and phosphor graininess the actual limit.  You used the 
electron beam to draw lines on the screen.  There was probably a
way to use a different electron energy beam to erase the lines,
but we were lazy and just erased the whole thing, like a big
"hollow state" etch-a-sketch (do they still make those?).    

No pixels, per se.  Well, we did read a "ROM" - a big array of
diodes wired into circuit boards - storing the pixels for ascii
characters.  But it was mostly about "calligraphic vector
graphics", drawing pictures with line segments.  If you wanted
to draw an Olde Englishe capital letter, and the RKO5 disk pack
on your PDP8 had the vector description, you could make something
beautiful, just like the medieval monasteries used to make -
assuming the monks were color blind.  Not bad for an era when
a big memory on a supercomputer was 192K bytes.

No aliasing.  4K*3K addressing on a 25 inch diagonal screen
(which took two strong people to lift).  Circles were CIRCLES,
dammit, if you spent enough time drawing little tiny vectors
at 115Kbaud.  No jaggies, none of this pixel nonsense.  Given
192K byte limits on supercomputers, you could not afford RAM
pixels anyway.

But memory prices were plummeting, and RAM pixels won.  I designed
an LSI replacement for the electronics on what would have been the
last storage CRT graphics terminal - except that by the time it
was done, RAM/pixel/raster graphics was already cheaper, and
obviously going to get cheaper still.  Storage CRTs were history.

Regards hexagonal pixel grids - that is effectively what you have
in analog color TVs (look up "interlace" and "color subcarrier").
The way we encoded color on the analog signal offset the color
information by "half a pixel" every other line, so the artifacts
of the low-bandwidth color signal were not visible.  It was a
clever way to send a lot of visual detail over limited broadcast
bandwidth, fooling the eye and the brain into thinking it was
seeing something in real world detail.  You still have aliasing,
with 3 axis symmetry rather than 2.

However, most of our graphics math and analytical techniques
still focus on cartesian coordinate space.  The X/Y grid
used in RAM maps onto the X/Y grid used in screen addressing.
When we compress images, we are still fooling the eye, but
we do so over larger extents and use a lot more information.  
Still, the best way to transmit an infinitely precise and
detailed line drawing is something like SVG, or spline outlines
for fonts,  providing drawing instructions instead of pixels. 

So the CRT, and the analog pixel-less screen, still exists as
an abstraction deep inside the core of graphics programs and 
font rendering engines.  It also exists in some 3-D printers,
numerically controlled milling machines, navigation systems,
and other Real World applications.  I suspect we will find 
ways to computationally "de-pixelize" orbit calculation,
chemistry and weather modelling, and find find faster and more
accurate ways to compute those, drawing on more interesting 
basis functions than cartesian grids.  

Learn More Math, and work on better internal representations.
The translation to pixels should occur after all the interesting
computation is complete.  The screen is just another object to
pipe abstractions into, and less interesting than many other
real world objects.

i'd recommend checking the svn docs online - i remember (when 
troubleshooting issues in upgrading to 1.6 from 1.5.x) reading about 
different data-migration strategies, depending on which kind of 
data-store (e.g. berkeley-db or file-based) used for your repos. Also, 
i've run into real snags when the server and client versions get too far 
out of sync.

   Perhaps I'm asking the wrong question. Instead, let me try asking what I
should read to be able to scan color photographs using my HP Scanjet 5200C.

   I tried scanning a Polaroid print and it came out totally solarized. I'm
not a color maven so I have no idea if the default xsane settings are off or
what I should change to get better quality from the scan.

No idea.  There are lots of knobs on xsane.  I'd try systematically
playing with those.

Rich,

In Xsanee sellect Color, Full color range.  The 5200C is a good 
scanner.  I had one until it died.

Ken,

   That's what I did. The preview and scan looked like a solarized print.
I'll try something other than the Polaroids and see what happens, because
I remember that long ago I scanned a 10"x10" color aerial photograph on it
and that worked.

i've seen tnis happen from tim to time, mostly when connecting a 
full-sized USB keyboard to my laptop via a kvm switch (at home) or 
docking station (at work). A complete disconnect/reconnect of all usb 
things usually clears it up.

Firefox 3.6.17 on Fedora 14 x86_64, everything up to date.

I am finding that Firefox cannot find pages on certain links. It
appears that the link that Firefox cannot find is a link that ends
in .asp, not that I have any ken what .asp means. For example, go here:

http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/

In the column to the left there are question marks for several of the
items. Hovering over the question mark reveals that the "link" ends
in .asp. Every one of them results in an Atlanta error.

Using Opera all the links work as expected. Apparently Opera can handle
links ending in .asp, while Firefox cannot.

What do I need to add to Firefox to make it work with these links?

The links work fine for me.  Also firefox 3.6.17, but on centos i386.

And I most definitely did not install any plugins to handle active server
pages.  Maybe it's a bug in the 64-bit firefox?

Thanks for the responses.

To clarify, there are nine question marks in the column. My Firefox
works on #1 and #5, but the others give me "page not found." However,
all of the links end in .asp. So apparently my Firefox does work
with .asp links, just not all of them. Opera works with all of them.

I asked Google, but Google failed to find any responses on point.

I do have some Firefox add-ons, but disabling the obvious suspects
(e.g., ad-block) didn't change anything.

I can get my work done with Opera, but I'd like to get to the bottom of
this. Firefox is my preferred browser.

Thanks for the idea. However...

There's a great Mark Twain piece about how he got rid of the lumbago by 
giving up stuff like cigars and liquor, and how he offered that remedy 
to an elderly neighbor lady, who said that she didn't do any of those 
things. His response was that she had neglected her vices and when the 
time came to lighten the load of the sinking ship she had nothing to 
toss overboard (or words to that effect). Alas, that is where I find 
myself regarding your offered remedy.

There are no USB devices connected to this machine. On rare occasion I 
do connect something, but it has been quite awhile since the last time I 
did. However, just to say I've done it, I plugged in my USB flash drive, 
deleted some of its contents, unmounted and removed it. The caps light 
did not change status.

asp = Active Server Pages.

That's an MS functional equivalent of php.

They work on my installation of Firefox, version 3.6.17, on Ubuntu 10.04.

Fedora 14, Firefox 3.6.17, on a 64-bit, dual-core Athlon system.

All the links worked fine for me.  I'm rather at a loss to
understand what might be wrong.  The only thing I can think of
would be some obscure configuration setting.  I've no idea what,
though.  I suppose you could try moving your profile someplace
where Firefox won't see it.  Firefox should generate a new one, I
think.  Don't delete the old one, just in case I'm worng!  :-)  I
guess something could have gotten corrupted, somehow.  If all
else fails, try re-installing it ("yum reinstall firefox").

Subject: [PLUG] USB foot pedal controller
Message-ID: <4DC82A1B.1000704@comcast.net>

If I wanted to use a USB foot pedal to control sound playback, would I 
have to write something to go into one of the sound playing programs? Or 
is there some way to make the three switches on the USB controller 
generate the same signals used for play/pause, fast forward, and rewind?

I'm using a VEC Infinity IN-USB-1 foot pedal with Express Scribe 
software on XP. There's supposed to be a way to run the software on 
Linux using Wine, but I haven't gotten it to work. I was wondering if it 
would be possible to just use something like Rhythmbox Music Player, or 
some other sound playing program, but with the foot pedal to control 
playback.

Instead of moving your profile, just launch firefox with it's profile
manager and then you can create additional ones for testing.

$firefox -ProfileManager

Hard to say.  I don't know what the foot pedal looks like to the system.
("lsusb -v" or "usb-devices" would provide a huge amount of info.)

It might appear as a keyboard device that generates special keycodes, in
which case it'd be workable just by assigning keycodes.  If it appears as a
joystick or something else, a custom plugin for your media player could
handle it.  At worst, you could use a little daemon to listen and insert
keycodes. 

If you want to get wacky, you could make your own super-custom foot-pedal.
I've used a Teensy (USB Arduino clone) to generate keycodes and other USB
events based on switch and analog inputs.  It's really cool - you can turn
any sort of electrical input into a virtual keyboard or mouse.

That's what I'm hoping for.

Sounds like more work, but I'm willing to learn something new to me.

Nice!  Looks like the pedal is a Raw HID device, which means it needs a
program to listen to it.  But wait... if I Google for 05f3:00ff
(vendor:device IDs) I get interesting results:
A Gnome program that does what you want: http://code.google.com/p/footpedal/
A PureData plugin for using your footpedal as a musical instrument:

It's interesting to google device IDs from obscure USB devices,

I downloaded and installed this program. It places an icon of a foot on 
the top bar of the Gnome desktop. The icon changes from a raised foot to 
a lowered foot when one of the pedal buttons is pressed. It also pops up 
a little black window that says "Foot pedal function:" followed by 
either FF, Play, or Rew, depending on the button pressed. So that tells 
me that the program reads the condition of the pedal. The next problem 
is to somehow get some other program to listen to it. It doesn't come 
with documentation at this time, so I'll have to read the source and try 
to learn some Python to figure out what it does with the signals it 
gets. But, that's a first step.

Thanks for the tip.

I haven't tried this one, yet. Later, when I don't have to get some work

Subject: [PLUG] so-called "next generation" firewalls
Message-ID: <1305066183.7124.7.camel@Maui>

Folks,

I keep reading about "Next generation" firewalls that filter different
Web services that go through standard Web ports, e.g. SonicWall,
PaloAlto, etc. These are firewalls that enable fine-grained blocking of
things like specific Facebook games, without blocking the rest of
Facebook, through port 80/443.

I can't find info on equivalent open source solutions, and was hoping
that someone here could point me to such resources, if they exist.
Ideally, it'd be something that could be configured on a regular Linux
gateway, and not some high price dedicated piece of hardware.

Thanks,
Mike

Ditto that. I upgraded and didn't actually notice that Subversion was
a new major version.

FWIW, sounds like the repos themselves are not upgraded unless you
explicitly do so w/ a "svnadmin upgrade" and v1.6 will happily work w/
v1.[45] repos:

I think so.  Because the link local network is the same on every
interface (??), it otherwise doesn't know which interface should get
the packet.

Solution: use a global scope address instead! :-)

Did you try configuring the program?  It's meant to send keyboard codes.
It's kind of complicated, since it has a "mode switch" function, so you can
switch between different sets of keycodes on-the-fly.

Normally, it would be called "Deep Packet Inspection", but this sounds like
recycled porn-blocker technology.  Simple stuff can be handled with Squid
or other proxies, and DansGuardian should be capable of handling more
complicated cases.

Anyone played with OpenDPI?

I have played with the configuration menu item, and it does allow me to 
select from a set of actions. However, I don't see where it associates 
those actions with a key or something like that. (I can't tell you what 
that menu includes right now, since I've got the foot pedal in use on my 
laptop, and the footpedal program doesn't get past a permissions error 
message unless the foot pedal is plugged in.)

Footpedal is a python script that resides in usr/bin and I can read it. 
Note that saying I can read it doesn't mean I understand it, yet. I have 
a python book, and I'll have to do some reading up to be able to 
understand what I'm seeing.

On a related note, I found a project called transcribe, also written in 
python. It's located at:

http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~frederik-elwert/transcribe/trunk/files/head:/transcribe/

I have all the python files and will study those, too. I installed the 
package and it works. It's missing a couple of features, but with the 
source, and after I do some python studying, I may be able to add what I 
need. Combine that with the foot pedal code, and maybe I can get what I 
really want.

The lead OpenWrt developer says that he's planning to include it in
OpenWrt after some cleanups, replacing the l7 filter stuff or
something like that.

DPI isn't going to work though if the payloads are encrypted.

many subscribe to the slackbuilds.org mail list (or use their scripts for

   The server that hosts slackbuilds.org, several other Slackware-related

my contribution via PayPal (as a personal gift and paid the minor fee), and

That is a DOS/Windows executable.  I don't run Wine..

That was the problem I was having.. There are A LOT of sites, when you

windows..

I would have asked why are you trying to play an email file, but I see 
from wikipedia that eml can stand for other things ... what does it mean

Aaron, Russ, appreciate it! Now at least I know where to start my
research. opendpi.org sounds especially promising.

FWIW, SonicWall claims they can decrypt/re-encrypt payloads "on the
fly," whatever that means. I presume if an encrypted payload can be read
in a browser, it can be read by some content filter, presumably with
headers at OSI level 7 or something more complex related to the actual
payload.

I might have a problem with having the private key on the gateway device of the network. I'd rather have it completely inside the network, on a system with different security.

Subject: [PLUG] OpenEMR, doctors, and "chickens"
Message-ID: <20110513182947.GA28582@gate.kl-ic.com>

The lead volunteer coordinator of the OpenEMR medical records
software ( http://oemr.org ) is Tony McCormick, who lives in
Tigard.  There are other open source medical records packages,
most notably WorldVista (not the so-called OpenVista, which
is proprietary!) but OpenEMR appears to be the most complete,
has the most certifications ($$$!) and the most likely to
integrate with clinical practice and future requirements.

In the Portland area, most doctors are getting absorbed
into Providence, Legacy, Kaiser, or big practices such as
Portland Clinic and Cascade.  Most of these are moving to the
proprietary EPIC software.  Although this is allegedly fully
interchangable with HL7 data interchange standards, folks
here are familiar with the effects of "embrace and extend".

There are about 300 small/individual practices left in Oregon;
at the rate things are going, there will be none in 5 years.
The small general practitioners are being squeezed out, partly
because of predatory pricing for EPIC (it can be upwards of
$20K/seat/year).  It is not quite so bad in most parts of
the country, but for some oddball reason, the insurance and 
medicare reimbursements are lower here than elsewhere.

Practice margins are slim, and for some doctors take-home
is less than 15% of clinic revenue.  That's why the visits
are expensive, short, and delayed - 12 patients/day rather
than 14, and you go bankrupt.  When the squeeze gets too
high, doctors retire early, or retool for other trades. 
I know one MD who is working as a software tech writer.
She says the hours and pay are better.

There are stories from the 1930's depression about patients
paying doctors with chickens and garden produce.  Obviously,
that will not work with big clinic industrialized medicine.  
However, there still might be a niche for that in Portland's
"weird" open source culture.  Coding, customization, and
adapting to EPIC "embrace and extend" shenanigans, in return
for visits to the doctor?  I don't know whether such a thing
is practical or even legal, but it might be both lifesaving
and fun if we can figure out a way.

OpenEMR is a web app based on php, with a mysql back end.  Lots
of room for customization to individual practices (which are
often idiosyncratic, patient and not business standards driven).

Further, being open and web based, OpenEMR may be compatable
with new kinds of patient interfaces, new kinds of apps, etc. 
Two examples might be bicycle exercise management (perhaps
connecting to apps for safe routes and air pollution) and
allergy exposure management ( which parts of town have the
fewest or most allergenic plants?).  A healthy EMR system could
be part of a large fabric of life-management applications,
supporting a lot of new software startups in Portland.

Let's not just be weird, let's get rich exporting weird!

If some of you might be interested in participating, perhaps
we can pull Tony away from his code and his family for a 
presentation to PLUG.  I don't think he has time to perform
in front of non-participating looky-loos.

May 15 - 3rd Sunday - is Linux Clinic.  According to Wikipedia,
On May 15, 1911, the United States Supreme Court declared Standard
Oil to be an "unreasonable" monopoly under the Sherman Antitrust
Act and orders the company to be broken up. 

So (assuming John is available with the keys) we will meet at 1PM
at Free Geek at 1731 Southeast 10th Avenue (about 3 blocks south
of Hawthorne), and break up the M$ monopoly on PC hard drives.  We
have many Linux Distros suitable for your ancient or modern hardware.
We have keyboards, mice, and monitors, wired and wireless internet.
Bring your laptop, bring your CPU box, bring your tales of woe, 
we've got the rest.

We have knowledge, skills, opinions, attitudes, and neuroses which
may or may not help you solve pesky Linux problems, but will at
least keep you amused.  If you have similar traits, bring them
along and inflict them on others.  If you don't, come get some!

Breaking up is hard to do.  Stop by Sunday, for a break.

   How interesting. I'm trying to use CMS Made Simple which is also written
in PHP and uses ADOdb-lite for its default MySQL back end. While I had
version 1.8.4 working with postgres-8.x, I cannot get it working with
postgres-9.0.3 and cannot get help from the CMSMS, ADOdb, or PHP-postgres
communities. I understand that while it supposedly supports SQLite it does
so no better than it does postgres. From my perspective, this sucks big
time. I've been using postgres since 1997, and SQLite since 2003; I don't
want to install, maintain, and learn a third dbms to run a single
application.

   Yet, Ledger-123 (and its progenitor, SQL-Ledger) are also web-based apps
but they are written in Perl and can use many different rdbms back ends
(postgres is the most popular but not required) and many different browsers,
including text-based ones.

   This approach of allowing choices of database back ends and browser front
ends seems much more rational to me, particularly for open source
applications, than the approach of requiring MySQL (or at least not actively
supporting any other). Is this lock-in to one specific dbms back end due to
a single connecting layer, ADOdb-lite, that does not equally support all
open source back ends?

I don't use centos by choice but most of my clients do (and so i am
dealing with it frequently and even have a VM on my laptop with it
in).

i have to admit my involvement with the centos community has been slim
of late, but the last time i had to report a kernel driver issue, i
just filled out the bugzilla form and they responded quickly,
usefully, and most importantly handled getting me in touch with the
right people upstream at redhat and the driver maintainer to determine
a fix (incidentally, redhat were also really quick and useful,
especially considering i am in no way a customer of theirs)--before
they were even convinced my bu was a real bug that others might
experience (it was, but it wasn't due to the hardware i expected--it
was the (brand new) motherboard's bios that wanted an update.  that
was about 5 months ago, though.

so i would say things were looking good back then, at any rate?

Most of the noise on the Centos ML is due to the lateness of release Centos
6.
Right after RHEL6 released a RHEL5 update 6 from RHEL came out so it pushed
the development team in
mulitple directions at the same time.  It looks like they pushed through
most of the 5.6 updates
and made a 5.6 release.

Yes, SL 6 is already out.  It doesn't have the same overriding policy as
Centos - be 100%
binary compatible.

The LWN and other blog articles about this lateness is churning up people
that want to help
but don't go through the research to know where and how to help.  They just
start blasting away
on the ML to the developers.  They have been harsh to these people but
having to answer the
same type of question 20-30 times a week is very irritating.   The noise on
the Centos-users list
is so bad that I don't even read it anymore.

My involvement in the community has been small (almost nil) but I mostly
lurk on the developer mailing list.

Centos is not going away and Red Hat acknowledges that they are there.

The problem with CentOS is that it is based off of RHEL. Red Hat has taken
some steps to make it harder for CentOS from using their RPMs. (Like
having the kernel source as one large tarball instead of clean source and
patches.)

I have two big problems with CentOS.

The versions used are OLD. (As they are in RHEL.)  There are features in
SSH I would like to use on my home system, but the version used by CentOS
is about 5 years old.  If I wanted to use out of date, bitrotten software
I would install Debian.

The packages are quite limited.  I was going to install a program that
needed a pile of Haskell packages and most of them did not exist for
CentOS. Compiling the packages would have meant updating a number of other
packages just to get it to build. If I wanted to go through that headache
I would just install something that is current and upgrade every six
months.

Ubuntu has long term support for some of their versions, but they are
Debian based and I really have no love for the Debian package manager.

Granted, they were a bit overloaded when redhat released both rhel6 and
rhel56 at pretty much the same time.  At the time they made the conscious
decision to focus their efforts on 56, to keep existing users up to date
with security fixes, rather than on 60, which had no existing users.  My
impression is that these people are overworked and underpaid.  Heck, they're
not paid at all!

With that said, I've got a brand-spanking-new box under my desk, waiting
(im)patiently for centos60 to be released.  From what I hear, it's been
built and went to QA the day before yesterday.  So I should be able to get
it Any Day Now.

My best understanding of the issues besetting CentOS right now is that 
there are at least three issues:

First, Red Hat released RHEL 4.9, RHEL 5.6, and RHEL 6.0 within a 
short period of time. CentOS decided to go after the 4.9 and 5.6 point 
releases before focusing solely on 6.0. So CentOS has released *final* 
versions of 4.9 and 5.6, but not 6.0. SL chose a different priority 
set, so it's released 6.0 and 4.9 but not 5.6.

Second, for CentOS developers, 100% binary compatibility is required 
for a release. That means that every library and executable will have 
exactly the same linking and dependencies as RHEL. Running ldd against 
a library on CentOS will show the exact same dependencies as the same 
library on RHEL. SL aims for a bit broader target, and the 
dependencies aren't tracked as exactly.

Third, CentOS has suffered from a transparency issue. Some devs have 
made some strides in this area lately, but all too often the wider 
CentOS user community has little or no understanding of how much 
progress has (or hasn't) been made toward any given release.

That said, CentOS is alive and well. I'm sure that SL 6 has been taken 
up by its share of disappointed CentOS expatriots. It'll be 
interesting to see if they stay in the SL camp after CentOS 6 hits the 
streets.

I gather CentOS-6 is close. See these tweets from one of the main
developers -- http://twitter.com/#!/centos 

Thought I read somewhere that the expected time through QA is about a
month.

Nevertheless, the delay in CentOS-6 suggests that their updates might
not be timely.

Thanks,

I run CentOS on multiple servers and Fedora 14 on my desktop machine.

Here are the real problems that I see:

RPM and yum can still be improved.  I want to be able to list all the
non RPM owned files at a glance.  This is useful if a tarball is
installed and you don't know where it's files were placed.

Redhat Enterprise Linux is binary compatible with a lot of the
commercial software available for Linux.  Is Debian, Slackware, or
Ubuntu able to run everything that RHEL can?

Fedora which is so new and cutting edge is constantly receiving patches
for everything imaginable.

Dirk Dashing secret Agent still doesn't work correctly on my 64 bit AMD
system.

The idea of an enterprise Linux system is to do a feature freeze of
sorts and focus on critical bugs more.  Unfortunately, this means a
feature weak system.

I prefer CentOS over SL if SL is not binary compatible with RHEL.

I very strongly suspect that SL's somewhat less stringent 
compatibility with RHEL would matter only for installations reliant on 
third-party binaries. Even then, it would probably only be an issue in 
a fraction of the cases.

EMR systems are certified for particular configurations,
and the certification process is very expensive
( around $100K ) and slow ( months to years ).

I'm not sure what level of modularity and reconfiguration
the "modular ONC meaningful use certification" allows (see 
http://onc-chpl.force.com/ehrcert ) but swapping the database
engine probably means "back to square one".  Right now, the
focus for OpenEMR is to achieve complete 100% certification
for all the modules, which they expect to complete within
the next few months.  Progress info at:

http://wiki.oemr.org/wiki/OpenEMR_Certification

They already have certified CCR (Continuity of Care
Record) data interchange support and will have CCD
(Continuity of Care Document) support by 2012. See:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_of_Care_Document

The doctors, hospitals, and government agencies are very 
cautious about this stuff.  Lives are at stake, and there
are myriad opportunities for lethal errors.  Agility and
customizability are valued, but are much less important.

So "open source" will not always translate to "easily 
modified with modifications sharable" in the GNU sense.
The free software community's development processes will
be vital and active, but big changes will funnel through
certification agencies before full deployment. 

Still, I would rather trust my life to readable source code.
rather than closed source code, even if I can't tweak the
code quickly.  Usually, it is more important to know where
the bugs are, and avoid triggering them, rather than
patch them immediately (possibly introducing more bugs).

Perhaps someday, with exhaustive regression testing and
complete code test coverage, we can certify the meta
processes which produce FLOSS medical software.  Then
we can go at warp speed.

But the remaining hurdles for complete deployments are small. 
OpenEMR is partially deployed in clinics in North Carolina
and Texas and elsewhere, and some of us are helping some
local Portland clinics evaluate the software.  By the time
these clinics are ready to deploy, the code will be fully
certified.  With more software talent, and more savvy open
source folks evangelizing their physicians, both processes
will move forward faster.

Now, now.  You are suggesting that Debian == Debian/stable.

Aha!  Now the truth comes out!  You rpm enthusiasts are still sore

As always, Paul makes excellent points.  As an example of the
way SL deviates:  about a month ago a security mod to glibc,
propagated through the RHEL5 update process. The update broke
gnome-panel.  The Fermilabs support team for SL released a
partial patch a few days later, and a full patch about a week
later, pushing the patch back upstream to RedHat.  I welcome
that kind of response, but it doesn't conform to 100% binary
compatability to The Upstream Vendor.

I run some $$$$ proprietary chip design software targeted
for RHEL5, but use SL instead.  I also use EL5 and CentOS5
repositories for upgrades, and have not had any problems, so
"less than 100% compatability" has never been an issue for me. 

My biggest problems are with the bleeding edge developers
attracted to projects like OpenOffice and Firefox, who insist
on very recent versions of libraries.  Since I've written an
enormous collection of small one-off programs for Real
Scientific Computing ("Horrors! Using a computer for computing?
HERESY!!!") over the years, the biggest problem with the
upgrade treadmill for me is breakage (excuse me, upgrades)
of the libraries these older programs depend on.  That kind
of breakage affects the chip design programs I use, too.

The Scientific Linux support team is sensitive to this, and
occasionally will release SL security updates of Firefox and
other tools that don't need new libraries.  Most scientific
computer users are in the same boat I'm in.  Some of them
run multi-month compute jobs on kilo-processor parallel
machines, and don't take kindly to security upgrades which
break the programs they are using.

Legacy code doesn't work for everyone.  Some people do
best with the latest and greatest code (and ride 20 year
old bicycles).  But when developers are too clueless to
realize that the world that feeds and clothes and houses
them is strongly dependent on legacy code, they should not
be in charge of the upgrade process.  Fortunately, there
are clueful support teams who understand legacy code.

In any case, I'm glad the CentOS folks are still doing good
work.  I hope they get back on track for a timely 6.1 release.

Keith

yes, link local is just that, local to that link.  so unless you tell it

True reconciliation is never cheap, for it is based on forgiveness, which
is costly. Forgiveness in turn depends on repentance, which has to be
based on an acknowledgment of what was done wrong, and therefore on
disclosure of the truth. You cannot forgive what you do not know.

Hi.  I'm coming up to Portland for the first time next month to teach
"Introduction to Automating System Administration with Cfengine 3"
day class at the USENIX (international Unix Users Group) conference.

I am writing to let you know about the conference and the class
(http://www.usenix.org/events/fcw11/training/tutonefile.html#f1)
and to invite you to attend, if you haven't been invited yet.

There will be other great tutorials, Linux Performance Tuning,
SELinux, etc.  You might want to check it out if you haven't already.

The day class is for pay, but if there is any local interest, I'd be
happy to give a free presentation on the same subject, maybe 1-2 hours
long, or whatever you can stand. :)


Yours truly,
Aleksey Tsalolikhin

"Probably more work then it is worth.." ... I should leave that to you 
to decide, however one could try this to get a bit more information ...
    (a) save the (eml) file to disk some where convenient (I typically 
put it in a special directory on my desk top so I can remember to delete 
the whole thing when I am done)
    (b) at the CLI (command line interface) cd to the place one put the 
file and run file against it (file filename.eml) and see what one gets back.
... usually that will give one enough information on the type of file 
and the contents, that one can decide what to do next ... but write 
again if you still have a question
Good luck

I'd most definitely be interested; we use Cfengine 2 extensively and 
I'd love to get a decent intro to version 3. If your presentation was 
during the workday, I could likely provide a conference room in 
downtown Portland -- complete with a projector and wi-fi -- that'll 
seat 25 people or so. (That's subject to availability, so it would 
depend on the specific date and time.)

Thanks, Paul.  My full day class is Friday, June 17th.  I could do a 2 hour
intro presentation on Saturday morning before heading back.  Would enjoy
meeting other Cfengine users.  How does that date and time sound?

Subject: [PLUG] Dubbing commercial VHS tapes...
Message-ID: <1305361853.2935.25.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I want to do away with VHS.  VHS tapes take up too much space 
compared to say DVDs or a Linux server with a single hard drive.

Trouble is, those darn Disney tapes seem to be copy protected.  I
believe it is legal to make a backup copy of a commercial VHS tape
for personal use, but how does one get past the copy protection?  
The LiteOn DVD burner / VHS tape deck my Dad bought years ago works 
for going from VHS to DVD when a camcorder is involved, but forget
copying any commercial tapes.  The minute you pop in a VHS tape of 
say Aladdin and hit the copy button, copy protection flashes on the
television screen.  The copier obviously knows somehow that the source
VHS tape is copy protected material.

I having nothing against Disney per se trying to make it impossible 
to copy Disney VHS tapes, but Disney should offer a send in your VHS
tape and we will give you a rebate on a replacement DVD copy program.

What do people know about going from VHS to a local area network 
file server legality wise and technologically speaking?  What 
works and what doesn't work?  Is it legal to stream commercial 
videos from a local area file server for private home use?  Is 
it legal to copy the VHS case pictures to put on a private local 
area network titles web page?  I'm thinking a thin client can 
connect to the actual television and use that television as the 
monitor so to speak.  Streaming would involve pulling so many 
minutes into a large memory buffer off of the network before 
that many minutes is played so that there is no jitter.  The 
thin client would run NFS root off of the network.

Once the commercial videos are copied to say DVD discs, is it 
necessary law wise to keep the original VHS copies?

Are there companies that convert commercial VHS tapes to DVDs
for you legally?  I'd happily pay $10 plus the VHS tape to 
trade up to a legal DVD copy.

The only problem with replacing VHS tapes with DVDs is that even DVDs
take up a lot of space and you end up with a my DVD library is too big
problem.

If it isn't legal to even back up commercial VHS tapes, just say so.

And so there you have it ... it is a text file ... not something that 
could be played with an  audio and/or video application.
Hope that helps

Subject: [PLUG] pygtkconsole.py troubles
Message-ID: <4DCEC9D7.3070407@comcast.net>

I'm trying to work with the PyGTK 2.0 Tutorial.

http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/index.html

Early on it wants me to use the script pygtkconsole.py.

http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/examples/pygtkconsole.py

When I run the script from a terminal window, I get:

rsteff at Moonguide:~/Documents/Python Examples$ python pygtkconsole.py
Python 2.6.5, PyGTK 2.17.0 (Gtk+ 2.20.1)
Interactive console to manipulate GTK+ widgets.
 >>>

However, it doesn't respond to normal characters typed at the keyboard. 
It will respond to <ctrl>c and produces the following:

 >>> pygtkconsole.py: Fatal IO error 11 (Resource temporarily 
unavailable) on X server :0.0.

At that point, the program exits, but typing in that terminal no longer 
produces text.

Googling that error message turns up one hit, in German. The Google 
translation indicates that 'This is the normal error message when an X 
program is terminated "from outside", so far nothing unusual.'

Any idea what I'm missing?

following the same CLI instructions from above, run this to see its
contents:

cat jan.eml

I could guess that this file was sent to you via email, and you tried to
save the video file, but wound up saving the email itself instead. How big
is the file? It's possible that the video was saved along with it.. encoded.

It could contain an encoded attachment but file isn't smart enough to 
detect that. It would have to be opened by Thunderbird or similar and 
the attachment extracted.

Note also that Open Source Bridge is June 21-24, and the PLUG Linux
Clinic will be June 19 at Free Geek.  If we move the Linux Advanced
topics meeting to Monday June 20, avoiding conflict with OS Bridge,
we will have two weeks of nonstop Unix/Linux/BSD goodness!

Just do a Google for Video Stabilization Box.

Set you back 100 bucks or so and a lot of time, but if you are really into
preserving hardcopys of
low-res Disney movies, I think its your only option.

maybe instead of bashing your head against the wall determining how to 
open a proprietary format in a non-proprietary system, you can ask your 
pal to re-send the content in a proper format, with a brief word about 
the importance of using standard-compliant communications?

just a thought.

I'll have to see about rearranging a rehearsal that's been on my 
schedule for many months. If that works out (I'd give it a 50/50 
chance at the moment), would a 9:00 start time be OK?

Absolutely.  Both the full day class and the shorter intro talk are
geared as beginning classes.  Basic UNIX/Linux system administration
knowledge is the only prerequisite.  Somebody who's had no
experience with automating system administration would benefit
from attending.

I believe .eml files are actually RFC2822 compliant email messages,
and thus no lecture needed.  Normally you wouldn't find yourself
saving the message rather than the attachment, but if they forwarded
the message it's commonplace for forwarded messages to be attached,
and thus downloading the attachment might get you the email message
rather than the attachment of the attachment. I can't think of a handy
tool for automatically extracting all of the attachments, of
attachments out of an email file, but there is a good chance that you
can get it to load in a mail program. Email is ASCII text even the
binary attachments are encoded in ASCII. So you should be able to open
it in a text editor, and be able to seek down a ways, and see header
information with filename, and mime type followed by a huge block of
text that is probably in base64 encoding, it will say the encoding
type in the header. If you make a copy of it to be safe, and then
deleted the text before this  header you can probably extract the file
using a base64 utility.

I can.  It's called metamail, and it's been processing attachments
from rfc-compliant messages for at least as long as I've been on the
internet (20 years now, yikes).

Those who are interested in Aleksey's very generous offer of a 
two-hour Cfengine introduction on June 18, 2011:

* Is downtown Portland (6th and Washington) an acceptable location?

* Is 9:30 to 11:30 an acceptable timeframe?

If so, I'll try to rearrange things to make that happen. I should know 
within five or six days.

If not, please let me/us know as soon as possible to save me needless 
work.

If you plan to work as an IT engineer and maintain your sanity, I would
consider it far more than merely "appropriate". :)

It may well be worth the drive from Richland (and go to Usenix if you can!)

Config management is a core part of a set of practices called DevOps that
is trying to do for systems-management what CNC did for manufacturing:
automate the boring stuff and replace skill with process stability.

I don't have enough material for a proper PLUG talk on DevOps, but as you
can tell, I belive it's an important subject.

And dang it, I'm going up the gorge on the 18th...

Subject: [PLUG] Self-generated browser start page
Message-ID: <20110517204010.GA13865@gate.kl-ic.com>

I've been using iGoogle for a while.  I like the idea of
customizing my browser start page, adding maps and weather
and calendar.  However, google is increasingly taking control
of the page, and forcing "features" that I don't want, to
the point that I am looking for another option that gives
me more control (and launches from a local html file).

I can imagine a local file that can still access third party
Google applets, while allowing the creation of local applets. 
For example, I use an applet called "mysearches" or sometimes
"Multi Search", which allows me to enter text then choose the
site or search engine to process or search it.   I would love
to add more search sites to it.

But in the short term, a local page that can handle existing
google applets would be dandy.  Is there anything like that
out there?  Is there a website which (perhaps for paypal
donations) allows me to design such a page and download it
to a local directory?  

If not, is this a business opportunity for a javascript-
proficient web page designer?

Keith

You're on the right track. Bookmarks > Organize Bookmarks bring up the 
Library.

There's a frame on the left with All Bookmarks highlighted. On the 
right, I see a list containing Bookmarks Toolbar, Bookmarks Menu, and 
Unsorted Bookmarks. Either click on Bookmarks Menu in the frame on the 
left, or double click Bookmarks Menu in the panel on the right. Scroll 
down to the bottom and you should find the last thing you bookmarked, 
assuming you didn't put it in a specific folder.

   You're correct. They're now in the Bookmarks Menu section. I got them

Subject: [PLUG] Linux set top box...
Message-ID: <20110517191104.7os6pkou80gwwk8g@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I have a 65 inch rear projection Hitachi Ultravision Digital  
television with a DVI/HDTV input.  I assume that a Linux based set top  
box if one exists will connect to the television through the DVI port.  
  I want to stream videos that
are loaded onto a local (private) Linux based file server.  I also  
want to be able to stream say online television stations that aren't  
affordably available any other way to this television.  I want to be  
able to replace the traditional VCR by allowing the set top box to  
record over network onto the file server.

I'm intending using Grex to dub commercial VHS tapes to DVD and then  
somehow image those DVDs onto a hard disk.

If a Linux based set top box that comes with remote capable of doing  
what I want exists on the market, why build one?

How much cpu power is necessary?  How much onboard memory?  Do I need  
an HDMI output port?  What kind of video card is needed?  What is the  
smallest computer if I have to build my own set top box that I can use?

Will something from pcengines.ch work or do I have to look elsewhere?

Message-ID: <20110518013751.2751izgwug44o8ws@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

This is a 65 inch television with a DVI input.  I can plug my NVIDIA  
card in directly.  Trouble is, Fedora 12 as a test bed is going off  
screen.  The Nvidia proprietary driver is trying to run at 1920x1080.   
Is there a specific modeline
I can put in xorg.conf and if so, where do I put it and what is the  
exact line?
If I try changing to a lower resolution, the problem gets worse.

My intent here is to be able to stream video into the television off  
my Linux based network.  For example, I may have camcorder footage  
among other things.

My NVIDIA is a GEForce 6200 AGP card.

There doesn't seem to be any way through the television to shrink or  
move the picture at all.

Not a specific answer to your question, but there are LOTS of sites that help with computers in home theater setup. More than likely, the answer to this (and any other questions you may have about hooking this hardware up to that TV) is already posted on some board somewhere. 

I use http://www.avsforum.com a lot.

   Thanks, Frank. It's interesting how xrandr can determine the modeline for
us. There are certainly more steps involved than I thought, but as long as
they all work, it's fine by me.

Frank,

   Close, but not quite there yet. Each call to xrandr reports it failed to
get size of gamma for the default output (the only one active). Then, when I
get to the last step on that series of instructions I also see: "Configure
crtc 0 failed." Whatever that means. However, both resolutions are listed as
available, but the 1280x800 is the default and I cannot seem to switch that
to the 1440x900.

   So, I need to hunt for a source of additional xrandr expertise.

Thanks,

Rich

Hi Rich, 

I hate that too. I avoid it in Tools -> AutoCorrect Options 

Under the Options tab, you'll see, and should be able to disable:
"Capitalize first letter of every sentence"

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

   Aha! That's it, then. Abbreviations are followed by periods but they're in
the middle of a sentence, not at the end.

   I was looking in the wrong place for a solution.

Much appreciated!

Rich

This can be chipset and driver dependent.  One desktop mother board
had an Intel graphics chipset that would not talk to my 1400x1050
desktop screen through the DVI port.  That mobo got returned.

Assuming that your laptop graphics chipset (which?) was designed to
talk to your 1440x900 screen,  you may be having a software driver
problem.  Some drivers suffer from programmer "IWFMIDCAY" ( "It works
for me, I don't care about you" ).  If the driver doesn't support the
resolution, xrandr won't see it.  Fortunately, many chipsets have
more than one driver.  Sometimes, only the open source one works.
Sometimes, only the proprietary one works.

Look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log .  Your driver may list the available
modelines there.  If 1440x900 is not listed, you need to find another
driver.  If the log file shows the EDID information, you can find a
EDID parser program to interpret that.  If you are hypergeeky, you
can decode the EDID bytes manually.  That will tell you what the 
screen actually supports.

Keith,

   I think this is a continuing problem. Here are the specs:

Chipset         Mobile Intel HM55 Express Chipset
Graphics        Intel HD Graphics with dynamic frequency
Display Options 14.1" WXGA+ Anti-Glare LED Display (1440x900)
                 14.1" WXGA Anti-Glare LED Display (1280x800)

   Is the difference between WXGA+ and WXGA the driver?

   Only 1280x800 is listed.

Thanks,

Rich

The Free Geek site says they don't often have SATA.  I saw a 500 gig
SATA drive for 50 at Best Buy, and a few bucks less at Walmart.  Was
wondering if there was anywhere cheaper than that, or if that's about
as low as it's going to get.

most places aren't going to take up shelf space with items priced much lower
than that. Walmart might just be your best bet.... I had actually forgotten
they sell hard drives.

   Might be a false economy. I go to ENU for local purchases because they
sell quality drives. Historically, some brands and capacities were not as
reliable as other capacities in that brand. They'll not sell you junk
because it comes back to them and also denigrates their reputation. Best Buy
and MallWart don't have those concerns.

Given gas prices, I'd take the nearest location if the price 
difference isn't any more than five or six bucks...

Does it have to be local, rather than Internet?

If so: +1 for ENU and Fry's; but... your best bet is to check all the Sunday
ads (or Friday, in the case of Fry's)... and see who has the one YOU deem to
be the best deal (based on your needs, your budget, your brand and
performance preferences, and your location). Also... most of those places
will match an ad price from their competitors (helps with the location).

However... I saw an ad for CompUSA.com a couple of days ago... NEW Seagate
Barracuda (5900 RPM variety) for $29 (after rebate)... but I just checked
and they are now sold out.

A friend of mine paid $8 for a 40 GB Western Digital SATA from a guy who

If you want it, contact me off list and we'll make arrangements.

I see what looks like a HDMI port, nice.  Thing is, I specifically don't
want a built in wireless card as I have already put a network line in
for this.

This is why you run linux. So you can choose to not run the module that turns on the hardware you don't want to run. Besides from the looks of the picture, the wireless card is removable. Take it out and toss it.

I would liken this to saying, "I don't want that inexpensive car because I specifically don't want a spare tire."

I'm trying right now to get an old Intel D845PEBT2 to use the HDTV as a
monitor.  I certainly need to find a micro computer to replace it and
these recommendations are nice, but until I figure out how to get the
picture to fit on the television, I'm not ready to buy.  I'm trying the
standard monitor port on the NVIDIA card, maybe that's a mistake.  It
has to be possible to get a picture that fits the screen and doesn't go
over.  The HDMI input port is meant for a Digital DVD player.  I'm
having the same trouble in Windows that I'm having with Linux, so I may
need a very low level fix.  If the solution is to replace the Nvidia
GEForce 6200 though, I might as well pick a new board with built in
video.

Turns out under XP that the video driver has a special tool to fine  
tune the resolution so that the picture fits the screen.  XP Home 32  
bit is not going to work with MythTV let alone a dual core Atom.

How under Linux do I fine tune the resolution in X?

Message-ID: <20110522010811.n2bjw7fagookw844@web.robinson-west.com>

Is there an AGP 4x video card specifically designed for making an HDMI  
connection to an HDTV?  VGA is the standard, but a television is NOT a  
VGA monitor.

I still am wondering how to fit the picture to the screen in Linux.   
Worse, Linux text mode is nice to have but the GEForce 6200 I'm using  
doesn't fit the screen in text mode.

Why fight a video card designed for a standard monitor if I can get  
one that is designed for connecting to a television?

I'm beginning to think that getting Linux to install to a Wii is the  
way to go because of the video issues when a standard computer is used.

Surely someone makes an embedded board or a video card that is  
intended for HDTVs.
If not, somebody should.  The whole idea of a set top box is defeated  
if you have to have a computer monitor as well.

There is an old X application, xvidtune, that can help.  It's
still available, as part of the xorg packages.  I used it a LOT
in the old days when I had to create my own mode lines for the X
config file.  (Boy am I glad I don't have to do that anymore!)
There are a few HOW-TOs out there (Google should find them,
probably at the Linux Documentation Project), plus the man pages
for xvidtune(1) and xorg.conf(5).  It's been a long time since I
messed with building my own mode lines, so my memory is a bit
hazy, but here's a little info, for what it's worth.

Running xvidtune without any options will pop up a small gui that
allows you to modify the scan mode on the fly.  It will also pop
up a small window warning you that you can destroy your monitor
with a badly-chosen mode line.  I don't know that modern LCD
displays are prone to that, but CRTs certainly were.  You Have
Been Warned.  The gui allows you to move the display up, down,
left, and right, as well as adjust horizontal and vertical size.
The "prev" and "next" buttons allow you to step through the
various modes, but I believe you have to have them specified in
the xorg.conf file before xvidtune can use them.  The gui will
also show you the pixel clock frequency in MHz, and the horizontal
and vertical sync rates, in kHz and Hz, respectively.

Using the -show option will print out your current mode line,
without the gui.  As an example, here's mine:

$ xvidtune -show
"2048x1152"   156.75   2048 2096 2128 2208   1152 1155 1160 1185 +hsync -vsync

The various fields of this mode line are:
"2048x1152" -- name of the mode
156.75 -- the dot (pixel) clock frequency, in MHz
2048 -- width of the display, in dot clocks
2096 -- horizontal sync start time, in dot clocks
2128 -- horizontal sync end time, in dot clocks
2208 -- total horizontal scan time, in dot clocks
1152 -- height of the display, in scan lines
1155 -- vertical sync start time, in scan lines
1160 -- vertical sync end time, in scan lines
1185 -- total vertical scan time, in scan lines
+hsync and -vsync are the polarities of the horizontal and
vertical sync signals.

It is also possible to specify various flags, such as "Interlace",
at the end of the line.  See the MONITORS section of the
xorg.conf(5) man page.  I found a calculator to be very useful
when working with this stuff.  :-)  Once you've determined which
mode lines you need, put them in the xorg.conf file, and restart
X.  Be sure you back up your original xorg.conf file!

Anyway, I hope this helps.

   I have an application whose source code I download weekly from the

options are many and I keep them in a text file, then copy them line-by-line
to the command line. Is there a way to include the entire

including that command in the file) in one step?

If you always download the Subversion repository to the same 
directory, then just keep your configure options in a bash shell 
script. E.g.,

#!/bin/sn
svn export -q --force http://blah/blah/blah /your/build/directory
cd /your/build/directory
./configure \
   --option1=value1 \
   --with-option2
make

   Thanks, Paul. Didn't occur to me to put the whole process in a single

Or xargs:

$ cat myfile | xargs ./configure

If you want, you could even add comments using a hash (#) to your
options file and then filter them out:

$ grep -v '^ *#' myfile | xargs ./configure

Subject: [PLUG] Is my monitor dying?
Message-ID: <20110523172905.17287d89@mailhost.pdx.edu>

My desktop computer (Lucid, x86_64, up to date) uses the nVidia 6150 on
the motherboard. The monitor is a Samsung SyncMaster 206BW LCD display,
roughly three years old, maybe four. I am using the proprietary nVidia
driver.

The monitor has always worked fine, but a couple of days ago upon
restoring from the screensaver in the morning the monitor flashed on
and off for 10-20 times before finally displaying the screen. The day
before it worked fine. Every time I try to restore from the screensaver
now I get the same flashing. The flashing is not completely regular;
the screen flashes the display for a quarter of a second every two to
four seconds. 

Today I needed to reboot the computer for the first time since this
started. When the login screen tried to display I got the same
flashing. In other words, restarting the computer did not change
anything.

I don't have any other monitors to substitute for testing purposes.

Any troubleshooting suggestions or other observations welcome.

Hi

I need to do some lettering and the letters need to be 2.5 inches tall..

The letters in OpenOffice don't go that big...

There used to be a program called Banner..  But, I couldn't find a copy of that.

Any ideas??

Before I install this?

Is this pretty straight forward stuff?   Or is the learning curve way
to long for a single application?  I am very happy with OpenOffice.
All my needs, except for this one, are met.

If you can, try connecting the monitor to your laptop.  Also, I 
wouldn't rule out a problem with your video card rather than the monitor.

Bill's suggestion about checking the cabling is also a good one.

Subject: [PLUG] Netgear GS116 Gigabit switch died. Maybe.
Message-ID: <20110523182728.36257831@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I have had a Netgear 16-port gigabit switch, model GS116, for several
years. There is also a D-Link gigabit ethernet router, a Linksys WRT54G
wireless router, and a cable modem in the network.

Today I returned home and heard no tunes streaming from
AllClassical.org. This happens every once in a while, as their server
sometimes decides it's tired and takes a nap. When reconnecting did not
work I tried Radio Classique, but it didn't work either. When a couple
more stations failed to connect I started checking the internet.
Firefox could not go anywhere and I could not connect to e-mail either.
Then I tried my laptop, but got the same results. 

Further checking revealed that I could not ping any of my laser
printers from either computer (all connected via ethernet). My laptop
kept saying the network was unavailable, although it could connect to
the Linksys wireless router. But having connected to the Linksys, I
still couldn't reach anything, not even my printers.

I reset the modem, then reset the ethernet router, but still nada. I
unplugged the switch and then plugged it back in, but still no
connections. The lights on the switch were blinking, but not normally;
that is, there would be an occasional long blink, and from all
connected plugs at the same time instead of the usual jiggly blinking. 

Finally I bit the bullet and made a trip to Best Buy (closest place). I
bought a new Dynex 8-port gigabit switch for $58. After plugging it in
and restarting the network, all is back to normal in network-land. 

I have modems die. I've had routers die. But I've never had a switch go
out. 

Are there ways to reset switches? Can they be repaired?

Does the flashing occur when you turn your monitor off and back on
again while the session is active?  Is it connected to a KVM?  Is it
using VGA or DVI cables?

Inkscape lets you re-scale lettering arbitrarily.

There is a bit of a learning curve to Scribus, but it certainly will do
what you want.

But I am curious why you cannot get letters 2.5 inches high (180 points)
in OOo. I just did it here. No problem at all.

NetGear GS108 switches are (in)famous for having two caps of
questionable durability on one of the supply rails. If you can power
it on with nothing plugged in to anyport and it sits there without
blinking, but starts blinking once you get a few ports hooked up/busy,
that's a good sign.

Pop 'er open and see what value the larger electrolytic caps are.

Here's a reference:

http://qualapps.blogspot.com/2007/05/netgear-gs108-gige-switch-failure.html

If you want to try fixing it I've got a bunch of 1000uF/6.3V caps
leftover from a party pack purchase from DigiKey.

If you don't want to try fixing it perhaps you'd be interested in
selling/trading it to me?

Turning off and back on again was an easy test. The monitor did not
flash. Not sure what that means, though.

It is connected with a VGA cable. It does have an HDMI connector,
but the video out on the motherboard has only a VGA connector.
I don't know what a KVM is, so probably it is not connected to one.

After turning off and back on again I checked the cable. It was tight,
but I reseated it just on general principles.

I should have added that it works fine once it stops flashing.

If you unplug the monitors power cord and then plug it back in while the
computer is on does the screen flashing occur?
If it does, I am going to vote for bad ballast capacitors on the monitor.
If it is the capacitors you will see the screen take longer and longer to
get the back light lit as it fails.
If this turns out to be the problem, you need 6 bucks and a soldering iron.
I suppose that I should put an fi in here somewhere because that is a whole
lot of ifs.

I pulled the power plug, waited 15 minutes, then plugged it back in.
The monitor did not flash. It also did not flash previously when I cut
the power with the switch.

Just now it occurred to me to check /var/log/Xorg.0.log. The current
log is brand new, since I rebooted this morning. I read through it and
the only error message was that I don't have some Cyrillic font
installed that apparently Xorg wants. 

To summarize: The only times it flashes are upon restoring from
screensaver, and when X is trying to present the Ubuntu Lucid login
screen. 

I haven't tried connecting it to my laptop because I have work to get
done tonight and I'd have to set the laptop to screensaver and restore,
or reboot. I'll try that suggestion later.

Fixing, selling, trading are all options. But the trip to Best Buy
today was an emergency measure, as I had no other switches to
substitute for it. Amazing how critical net access has become. 

What I really want is a gigabit 24-port switch, as I have a 24-port
patch panel that is connected to the 20+ wired jacks in the house. Such
are expensive, however.

At the moment I need to put the discussion of fixing, trading or
selling on hold as I have some critical work to do in linguistics over
the next couple of weeks. And yes, it requires access to a web-based
corpus over a reasonably fast connection, hence my panic at not being
able to get on the net.

A KVM switch is one that allows connection of one Keyboard, Video 
Monitor, and Mouse to more than one computer -- typically two, but I've 
read about ones that can share the Keyboard, Video Monitor, and Mouse 
between three computers.

Whatever is causing the problem is related to how long the screensaver

screen goes just black. And it also happens at the login screen after
rebooting.

I use some that do 16.  Data Center, rack mounted.  And they can be 
piggy backed to do even more.

Maybe there's a bug in the screensaver. You can turn it off and see if
the problem still shows up, or switch to another screensaver.

This probably won't be of much help, but...

I've seen behavior like this before where the described problem occurs when
the monitor is switching "modes" (from one resolution, refresh rate, and/or
color depth to another). I can't say for sure, but I THINK I've only seen
this on CRT's (not LCD's) - but I can't swear to that fact.

So... I don't know what that really means - if it even applies to your
situation at all - but perhaps it will serve as a cluestick to someone else
around here that knows more about the electronics/electrical engineering
behind monitors and/or video cards. The capacitor issues (in monitor and/or
video card) mentioned earlier sounded promising to me (with my limited
knowledge of such things).

Best of luck.

   My Acer LCD monitor flickers when switching between text and graphical
modes. There's a message box in the screen center telling me that's what
it's doing.

   I don't use screen 'savers' but blank the screen. I see this adjustment
flicker when I start X and when I kill Xfce. Otherwise, not.

While this might be a software problem, I'm voting for hardware
because that is something I can make suggestions about.  The
backlight on some monitors powers off when commanded by the
video driver (and whatever power management driver that is
also controlling the screen saver).  It may be having troubles
turning back on.  Fluorescent backlights use high voltage,
and an "inverter" board to create it.  

Worst case, the fluorescent backlight tubes are wearing out.  
Those are very fragile and difficult to fix.  If the inverter
is going bad, that is a lot easier to fix, if you can find
the right circuit board.  If you can find someone with the
same model of monitor and anger management issues, they might
have a broken screen and a non-broken inverter circuit board.


But the easiest thing to fix, and a likely cause of your 
problem, is dust.  High voltage systems attract dust, and
cat hair, and all sorts of crap, which can overload
(temporarily) the inverter.  Bachelor lifestyles are not
good for dust control.  Taking the monitor apart and
cleaning the dust out with vacuum and Q-tips might help. 
Compressed air is fast, but creates static electricity.

Keep in mind Mr. High Voltage likes to romp in power supplies
and inverter boards, and he will romp on you if you let him. 
Unplug the monitor and wait an hour before opening it, so he
will get bored and go away.  But assume he does not.  Use
insulated tools, and an insulated work bench, insulated
shoes, and one hand.  

I recently bought a cheap used computer projector with a bulb
that failed after 3 minutes of power-on.  I opened it and
cleaned out a wad of dust around the high voltage section. 
It worked fine after that, and worked all day at Bar Camp
last Saturday.  Dust sucks, but they invented vacuum
cleaners to suck it.

I respect your education and experience on hardware issues, but I have 
to ask about it anyway. Years ago I was taught not to use a vacuum 
cleaner to remove dust because it creates static electricity by the high 
velocity air moving through the plastic nozzle of the vacuum, and that 
canned air was the non-static solution.

Did the rules change, or was I given a bum steer?

Enough facts there to be almost possibly correct, on occasion ;)
{tongue somewhat [*ONLy* somewhat] in cheek}

The basic kernel of truth in this is that static electricity can 
and does do nasty things to semiconductor devices {including any 
consumer monitor in last several decades}.

I personally would not worry about a vacuum - think about which 
direction air is flowing.

As to using compressed air to clean:
  1. never use air from typical air compressor - too much
     dirt/oil/water/crud/etc.
  2. canned compressed air (preferably dry nitrogen) probably OK:
     a. I guess cans with plastic tubes to direct stream *might*
        theoretically produce static charged stream.
     b. My personal experience is using an all metal
        nozzle/trigger assembly attached to a metal canister
        while I was connected to equipment ground with an
        anti-static wrist band. {I also tended to work on
        equipment for which a fingerprint was a short circuit.}

I would probably be more concerned about the brush and how it was 
used.

P.S. - understand there is a new technology out - transistors ;/

   To take pressure off John and his monitor I've a question for you hardware
gurus about my HP 5200C scanner. What might make it produce garbage rather
than clean text and photos?

   A few weeks ago I asked about an issue scanning color photographs. Today I
tried scanning a technical paper and saw gibberish in black and white rather
than color. The last time I scanned paper it worked just fine.

   Has anyone ideas about what might have gone wrong, and whether it could be
fixed? Or, should I just replace it with another legal-size flatbed scanner?
(Note: I don't want a multi-function machine as I already have two printers
and a fax machine here.)

Message-ID: <4DDC46D0.6090408@gmail.com>

This should be a simple Google search, but I must not be using the 
correct syntax.

I was dual booting WinXP and Fedora 14.  I decided to install Debian 6 
to a blank partition.  When all was said and done, I rebooted and, to my 
surprise, no Debian in the boot menu.  I think Fedora uses Grub and 
Debian uses Grub2.

Can someone point me to something that will help me sort this out.  I 
told Debian to install Grub to the MBR (I am fairly certain, anyway), 
and I would have thought this would override/overwrite the Fedora Grub.

Any thoughts on what I may have done wrong, and or what caused this 
minor mishap?

Any quick fixes would be appreciated, also.

Thanks,

Bruce

Last night I downloaded 32- and 64-bit of:

Fedora 15 (Gnome 3 default)
Fedora 15 KDE Spin
Fedora 15 LXDE Spin
Fedora 15 XFCE Spin

Plus, I downloaded the 64-bit Fedora 15 DVD, although not the 32-bit
version. I need the 64-bit DVD myself to upgrade. 

If someone wants any of the above and would prefer me to burn them a CD
or DVD, just holler.

(assuming that is a good match to your machine) doesn't seem to address 
what you are describing.
    Are there any error message ... I assume not since you didn't 
mention any, but I thought I'd ask anyway?

OK then, this only a scanner with no other capabilities (copy, print, 
etc), so one cannot test other function like the copy function output.  
But what you have noticed is that the quality of the scan output has 
deteriorated.

Has anything changed between the time of acceptable and unacceptable 
output?  The usual stuff ... OS, driver, interface, cable, etc?  On the 
subject of interface and cable ... have you unseated, cleaned, and 
reseated these connections?  If not, can you, and if yes, then was there 
any change in the operation or output?

If all of the above is good, except the output continues unimproved ... 
one might not be faulted for suspecting the lamp.  Or maybe dirt/dust 
inside the scanner (low probability, I think)?
Hope that helps

While I like the Ubuntu documentation on the subject
(https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 ), I've stuck with GRUB 0.97,
because it's easier to configure and customize in a single configuration
file. 

LMK if you'd like to see a copy of my grub.conf file, which is in a
similar triple boot (RHEL 6/Ubuntu Lucid/W7).

Thanks,
Mike

   Not that I can recall. I use the scanner infrequently but there's been no
system upgrades in a while.

   I'm calling Portland Printer Repair this morning. They will know if 1)
they fix scanners and b) if there are parts/repair kits for this guy.

Even more details - when I worked in a semiconductor lab, we
used a dry nitrogen jet with a metal nozzle, inside of which
was a largish chunk of radioactive Americium 243. Am243 is an
alpha emitter which ionizes molecule-thin tracks in the air
inside the nozzle, and paradoxically removes the static
(shorts it out).  Good tool.  Requires a purple trefoil and
a D.O.E.  permit, displayed in a class-10-clean transparent
box on the clean room wall near the nitrogen spigot.

However, I doubt that John has a clean high pressure air
source, or even canned air, though he might have a shop air
compressor and be erroniously tempted to use it.  He probably
has a relatively feeble vacuum cleaner, which I hope to steer
him towards.  There are proper cleaning brushes, which I
doubt he has, and Q-tips, which leave large lint.  A vacuum
cleaner helps with Q-tip lint as well as the dust.  He may
not have a good inspection magnifier, so whatever he uses
as a scrubber should leave visible (not tiny) lint.

Engineering is about making do with what's available, and
providing simple instructions to the worker bees so they
do the job "least badly".  My main concern is that John
is clever, and might try some of the same superficially
plausible but disasterous improvisations that I've tried
over the decades.  Those could result in a permanently
dead monitor, or a permanently dead John.

All that was packed into my two lines.  John is far
less resistant to reading than most production workers
I know, but over-simplified and clear is better than
wordy and unread.  All who suffer through my prolix
emails wish I would remember this more often.

Actually, ask now.  Or rather, ask two or three months ago.  Personal

Both these elements are alpha emitters.  As such, they are prone to
sputtering and creep--they at best walk out of their containment.  For
Polonium it can become air-borne.  I do not know about Americium, but I was

Of course it is.  Chromium is Google's Web browser.  In response,
Microsoft will release Polonium, which will be creepy, as you say.

Stop sputtering ... :-)

   To contiue the stream of bad puns, Microsoft has a history of alpha
emitters sold as production releases. The toxicity has been widely reported

Dear David, 

I don't have a Knoppix installation currently, but
http://www.knoppix.net/wiki/Hardware_FAQ#Q:_How_can_I_set_up_my_printer.3F. suggests you can configure a printer from the "Printer Configuration" tool in the Knoppix menu.

When you successfully add a printer, you should then be able to select
it from the libreOffice print menu. 

Thanks,
Mike

I'm not sure how the process works. Both of the times that we had a
booth (three years ago and last year) it was arranged by Dave Mandel,
and was a kind of last minute thing. In fact, last year we got word
like two days before the opening of the exhibit hall. 

I don't know who to ask, and I'm afraid to do so for fear of messing up
whatever Dave might already be doing.

Message-ID: <20110525162241.4c440b87@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Fedora 15, released yesterday, comes with Gnome 3. So far I see only
one person asking how to go back to 2.x, but there are a lot of users
asking how to do stuff. The number one problem seems to be how to
configure panels.

I haven't upgraded from Fedora 14 yet, and I don't plan to for a couple
of weeks. If you can't wait, best plan for some confusion.

A former client of mine has an embedded Linux application that's having

If anyone here in the Portland area knows their way around the Linux

I booted the computer with a live CD.  I found the grub.cfg on the 
Debian partition.  Looking the file over I note an entry set root=' 
(hd1,msdos6)'.  I'm thinking I misdirected the grub installation.

If my thinking is correct, do I need to reinstall, or is there a command 
to reinstall to the MBR?  Or can I tell Fedora to find Debian and add it?

Thanks,

Bruce

You don't need to reinstall, nor touch the mbr.  The beauty of grub is 
that the MBR looks at that file.  Change the file and your boot should 
work.  The trick is determining where the partitions are and setting the 
locations in grub.cfg appropriately.

Subject says most of it:  I'm looking for a good PDF editor.  Adobe

the one I use now can read the files, but can't extract pages.

I often get contracts in PDF format; rather than printing, signing,

contract.

I haven't tried printing to PDF yet to see if the blockage is stripped

Not sure exactly what the issue might be for you ... my recent 
experience with Adobe Acrobat "improvements" involved a "fillable form" 
that the creator had "locked" in such a way as to prevent the user from 
saving a copy of the completed form to disk (one could print it only) 
... silly but there you have it.  Is that your issue, or is it something 
else?  By the way ... no matter which PDF reader I might try, the result 
was the same.

I have found Scribus to be the best. It is not a pdf editor per se, but if
you want to add information to a pdf file, you bring the pdf in as an image
then insert text fields in the places you want to add text. Can also add
graphics, or make drawings, etc. Then export as a pdf and it is all there in
one pdf. Works well for filling out forms, signing pdfs, etc. I never could
get pdfedit to work for me, and gimp is harder to deal with than Scribus. It
is in the Debian repository, so I assume it is in others.

Scribus is what I used to use until I found xournal. You open the PDF in
xournal, then you can add text, lines, objects and shading, among a few
other things. You can save it as an xournal file, or as a new PDF. And
xournal pays little attention to restrictions in the original PDF file.
It's just a simple little light applet that works perfectly for filling
out PDF forms, whether the PDF was created to be editable or not.

I'd really like to know how to do this as when I attempted to import 2
different PDFs into Scribus  it threw a "format not acceptable" error. With
PDF Studio I could add text but it didn't print out on the line, e.g.
"Name:_______" It just shows a little pdf icon on the line.
ee
I finally tried http://www.pdfescape.com/ (free) and was able to create a
text box above the "name" field, then enter my name. It actually looks like
if was a form field that was filled out.

I haven't tried xournal yet...

John,

Very nice...just tried out xournal, and I agree, it is even easier to use
than Scribus to annotate a pdf!

Thanks for the tip!!

Mike,

Scribus does not import pdf files. What you do, is start with a new
document, then click on the graphic icon to add an image to the document.
Drag the graphic icon to the document, expand it. Then right click on it and
add the pdf file to the graphic window. Expand the window to fit the page,
then add text boxes as needed.

However, I just tried xournal, and it will open the pdf and is even easier
to use.

@Mark - Ah, thanks for the info.

@John - Yes, xournal works quickly and easily!

It's so great not to have to go frantically searching for a way to enter
simple text into a pdf now. :-)

Related request (I think) -- I'd just like to be able to turn on the
"Comment and Markup" toolbar in Adobe Reader for Linux, without having
to beg my editors with the full up Acrobat for help.

Does anyone know how to do that? It makes life a lot easier for
documentation to be able to mark up a PDF with cross-outs, replacements,
insertions, etc.

Thanks,
Mike

I'll second that. And though it's labeled as "experimental", the 
Windows version seems to work well.

It would appear to be reading grub.conf from the Fedora install.  Debian 
seems to be invisible at this point.

That's what xournal does. That is, xournal can add *to* an existing
PDF, but cannot edit the underlying PDF. You can save it as a new PDF,
however, which then makes your additions part of the new PDF.

There are FOSS tools that claim to be able to actually edit a PDF file
but, frankly, about all they can do is add page numbers or something
simple. If you really need to edit a PDF file you have to bite the
bullet and get Adobe Acrobat - and a Windows or Mac to run it on as,
last I checked, it won't run under WINE. Or be a graduate student at
PSU and use one of the graduate student computer labs. 

And even Acrobat is limited as to how much editing it can do. The
problem is that when a document is exported from the originating
program as a PDF the text is made into chunks of text so line wrapping
no longer works correctly. And some programs export the text as
outlines or the whole pages as bitmaps, where there no longer is any
text at all. Real edits to a PDF file are a PITA. A PDF is the end
product that is not meant to be edited by design. Save the original
document for future editing.

It seems to have one feature that is lacking in xournal, that is, you
can move an object after you create it.

However, I don't like being dependent on a web-based app. Yes, it's
free, but xournal is FOSS.

This guy's grub setup walk through might be helpful as one Linux install has
GRUB on the MBR and the other one is on it's own partition. Which is what
may have happened with your install. He uses parted magic to sort it all
out.
http://reddevil62-techhead.blogspot.com/2009/02/how-to-edit-grub-menu-to-dual-boot.html

Also, you can run the "update-grub" which will update GRUB with kernel
installations/removals or other updates which would affect its output.

HTH!

Very interesting. But after reading it all I'm not sure exactly what I

   To close this thread and preserve the information for posterity: the HP
Scanjet 5200C is not repairable. HP produced no service manuals and parts are
not available either.

   I replaced the HP with an Epson Perfection 3200 Photo. Xsane immediately
recognized it, but as a GT-9800 (same epson2 driver) and it works great on
documents, photographic prints, and negatives.

This morning it has been flashing for the past 45 minutes. It is
getting worse and worse, which makes it pretty likely that it is
a hardware problem.

I have also connected my laptop to it and it still flashes. The laptop
has an nVidia NVS Quadro 140M and uses the nouveau driver. The GUI
showed that the Quadro detected the Samsung monitor and got its EDID
correctly. I set it to mirror the laptop, but the monitor is still
flashing.

The next step is to find a different monitor to try out.

Edit:

Just used Samsung Support Live Chat and confirmed that the monitor is
kaput. Now I'm trying to find the sales receipt from Fry's to see if
it's still within the 3-year warranty. Else, I'll just buy a new
monitor. And not a Samsung.

No chance of repair?  It sounds like a power supply problem.  Maybe just a
capacitor replacement.

I just confirmed that it is out of warranty (more than three years).

I'll be happy to donate the monitor to someone who has the time and
wants to mess with repairing it. I don't have the test equipment /
tools / knowledge of electronics to do the repair myself. 

I'm just going to buy a replacement. I want a bigger one anyway.
The 206BW does 1680 x 1050, but I want one that will do 1920 x 1080 at
least.

Yeah, I've fixed two displays like that which had been thrown away by
others.  If I didn't now have a substantial surplus as a result, I'd
ask for yours too! ;-) The capacitors cost about a dollar.  Much
cheaper than a new monitor.  Whatever you do John, don't throw it away.
Someone can (try to) fix/use it even if you don't want to.

The old monitor is up for grabs.

I just got back from ENU where I purchased a new ASUS 21.5 LED monitor
that does 1920 x 1080. It is connected and working fine. The vertical
height is the same, but it is wider. After adjusting the resolution in
Lucid to 1920 x 1680 it looks much nicer than the old monitor. 

It cost me $168, less a $10 rebate, if ASUS actually sends it to me.
(Hate mail-in rebates.) I shopped and ASUS, Samsung and Viewsonic are
the only ones left offering a 3 year warranty.

Well, I know a little more than I did...Grub was installed to the MBR of 
the memory stick that held the Debian install iso.  Once up and running 
I had more issues than Grub.  More on that with a new topic, maybe.

This may be as far as I get to play with this problem.  A simple 
reinstall may be the easiest fix for me.  I just wanted to see and 
tinker with Debian.

/home directory issues may keep me from mixing Fedora and Debian.

Thanks for the help.

I assume you figured out how to use grub-install to get the GRUB pointer
into the MBR of the appropriate physical drive?

I have RHEL 6 and Ubuntu Lucid on the same laptop, sharing the
same /home directory. The key for me was to set up all UIDs/GIDs in the
RHEL database starting with 1000.

I boot into either, and can still use my /home configured tools (e.g.
browser, PIM, e-mail, etc) in the same way on both systems.

Thanks,
Mike

Well, doesn't changing the major number mean a major freeze?
In essence, the first 3.0 release should be a massively bug 
fixed 2.6 kernel.

I'm a little confused about the seemingly arbitrary decision to jump to
Linux 3 over say Linux 2.6.50 or Linux 2.8.0.  I was expecting a 2.8
series to come out at some point.  I think a new kernel that does not
significantly depart from 2.6 should be called 2.8.xx instead of 3.0.xx.

I suggest the Linux kernel developers work on NFS root, I've seen slow
change since the 2.4 kernel which has lead to much confusion on my part
because the HOWTO's don't seem to be catching up.  Getting error
messages like don't use mknbi-linux, use mkelf-linux is a bit much.
Turns out, there is apparently some other tool now that is supposed to
be used instead of mkelf-linux.

Oh, another area I suggest focusing on is how you connect a Linux box to
an HDTV and actually get the screen, text or graphical, to fit.  I've
had no shortage of frustration dealing with this problem and so far I've
only been able to use Windows XP which is totally unworkable.

Another thing, around 2.6.18 or so some major compatibility issues
cropped up.  There have been some creeping changes in the 2.6.xx
kernels, I hope decisions that need to be made are made and that
the kernel stabilizes for a while.

Mike,

Is there a way to do that without going through the list one by one and 
making the changes to fit the Debian uid/gid model?

I have not yet done the enough research to find the total answer for the 
grub issue.  I have found several web pages to start the learning 
process of booting from a live cd and reinstalling grub2.  I suppose I 
could just update the Fedora grub and Debian would then be listed...

Ok, but don't you think the kernel developers are the ones that would have input into this?

Is this the kernel developers mailing list?

Consider your audience, Michael. Mostly, this is a list of linux users and professionals helping each other out. I don't know if there are actually any kernel developers on this list, and that audience would be your target. 

If I want to get a change to some law in Beaverton, I don't go talking to some citizens in West Linn.

Looks like usermod and groupmod might be the way to go...may have to fix 
something outside of the /home at some point.

Yup, that's the start of my approach. I then proceeded to chown -R
1000.1000 on my home directory. If you have other regular user owned
files, I suppose some sort of find exec command combo would take care of
that. 

As for GRUB, your description is why I found it simpler to stick with
GRUB 0.97 (what's on RHEL 6, and what I think is still the default for
Fedora).

Thanks,
Mike

Reading the note from L.T., this is a major sociological hack,
not a technical one.  The interesting aspect of this release
is how tiny the changes will be from 2.6.X, and that is VERY
INTERESTING.  This is Not How Things Are Normally Done, and
the reason I usually avoid the X.0.0 release of anything.

Given that the 3.0.0 release will have no major architectural
changes, but instead represents the culmination of years of
improvement of 2.6.X and previous kernels, this may be a 
raspberry at the whole arrogant, unreliable process that
normally accompanies major new releases.  Because 3.0.0 is NOT
a huge experiment that makes the rest of us beta testers, it
may last a very long time, even as subsequent 3.0.X kernels
incorporate all the latest and greatest (and bug-ridden)
experiments that we know and love (and fear).

Torvalds has always struck me as a moderately competent
technician and a brilliant tactician.  I hope he succeeds.

Keith

P.S.  Perhaps you still think Torvalds was joking about
"world domination?"

Subject: [PLUG] Changing nfsroot system to Slackware 10.1...
Message-ID: <1306793855.2991.6.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

This is what I have on my other NFS root server where I have Fedora Core
1 on the server I want to change.  Trouble is, I can run Perl 5.12.x on
the Slackware 10 box but I can't run that on the Fedora Core 1 box.  So
I can't set up checking the current temperature from a sensor because
the perl-Storable module doesn't match.  The obvious solution is to back
up the Fedora Core 1 system and replace it with Slackware 10.1.
Question is, what is the easiest way short of throwing a hard drive at
the problem to do this?

Here is the idea I'm mulling over:

     Wipe off the dedicated partition on the server and untar Slackware
10.1's aaa_base package in that directory.  Will that create the proper
directory structure and put everything in the right place or do I need
to do something else?  After that, I figure I need to install the bash
package.  What else am I doing to need to unpack to get the system to
boot?  At the point I can boot, I should be able to add packages from
the client side.  

Next question, does anyone know of a set of Slackware rc scripts I can
grab that have been redesigned for NFS root?  It would be convenient to
be able to say reboot remotely and have that work.

It's not Open Source and requires Wine to run under Linux, but this
has worked for me:

http://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-viewer

"I often get contracts in PDF format; rather than printing, signing,
scanning, etc., I'd rather just drop my signature and the date into the
contract."

That's exactly what I use it for.  I have a few signatures uploaded
into it as graphics.  I just stamp them where I want them, save, and
send.

Regards,

I received a survey call "connect".  It asks for names of people in our
community whom you consider to be valuable contributors.  I think that there
are some PLUGers here who should be on that list.  Maybe if you feel so
inclined, you might respond to the survey  with your choices.

You add objects as in graphics?  I can't see how to do this.  (xournal 
0.4.5, on Ubuntu 8.04).

No, xournal cannot add graphics. You can make your own "graphics" with
xournal - shapes, lines, etc. But you cannot import graphics from
outside. Xournal is mostly designed for markup. If you have a form to
fill out that the creator stupidly did not make as an editable PDF
xournal lets you enter text boxes over the blanks. You can also
highlight and a few other things. But it can only add its own native
objects.

If I need to add a graphic on top of a PDF I use Scribus. There may be
other, simpler tools that will do so, but since I know Scribus it's
simpler for the rare times I need to add a graphic to a PDF. 

And note that neither xournal nor Scribus can actually edit the PDF.
All they can do is open the PDF and let you place things on top of the
PDF, then resave as a new PDF.
