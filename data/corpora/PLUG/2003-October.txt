Check if it's getting loaded as a module (/etc/modules). But if it's not
loaded as a module, and you won't either compile a kernel and you can't
find a kernel for the system that has no usb support, there's not much
you can do. Of course it really isn't a lot of overhead--mostly it's
just a little extra startup time.

Subject: [PLUG] ACPI and suspend on a Dell Inspiron 4000 with Debian unstable
Message-ID: <1065003437.672.6.camel@localhost>

The title says it all, I suppose.

I have tried for hours, to find some fix to this, and I haven't found
any good clues. Here's the situation:

I am running debian's kernel-image-2.6.0-test4 on a Dell Inspiron 4000.
ACPI loads at startup, and dmesg doesn't have any obvious errors.

But cat /proc/acpi/sleep gives me no file or directory
and echo 1 > /proc/acpi/sleep gives me:
bash: /proc/acpi/sleep: No such file or directory
(same if I'm in /proc/acpi and type echo 1 > sleep)

And my suspend button, which works fine under 2.4.x, doesn't do anything
anymore.

So I can't get the laptop to go to sleep. Closing the lid does nothing
(except /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID/state shows closed instead of open,
which is amusing, as I have to type that on my external keyboard, blind,
to find that out =).

Ideas anyone?

Jeff

Thanks, we ended up using commitinfo to run a ksh script that examined the
committer's uid and grepped the CVS Entries file for tag strings.
Shudderingly ugly, but it works.

I want to agree with you here -- in many cases, DNS just doesn't do
what you'd expect any more -- but "purpose of" arguments nettle me.

Who's to say that folks can't find new ways to use an existing tool? I
may not appreciate the end result of some forms of creativity, but
that doesn't mean that all software should do only what its original
coders wanted, and nothing else.

All sorts of cool things are the result of someone using or modifying
an existing tool in a unique way:

* The "purpose of" HTTP and HTML was one-way Internet publication --
  so Slashdot and every other web-based bulletin board that uses them
  for two- or multi-way communication has violated their purpose.

* The "purpose of" Unix was to provide an operating system for
  multi-user login and processing servers. So Linus adapting it to run
  on personal computers, PDAs, and embedded devices has violated its
  purpose.

Like I said, I share your frustration with the way DNS is often
administered -- but I don't think that shoving software into a box and
saying "you can do this, but nothing else" is the answer.

No. For some reason having nothing to do with reality, I always pipe
stuff into sed rather than pointing it at a file. I don't know where I

Subject: [PLUG] pdf file and ocr: closure
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0310010630380.13957@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  A couple of days ago I asked for help in disassembling a pdf file. Turns
out that the file was scanned, not generated from the original digital text
file so it's in bitmapped format. I tried printing the file to produce a
postscript output that I ran through 'convert'. But, when gocr chewed on the
output of that step only the first page printed as text.

  I now know the solution and offer it here to close this thread: pdftopbm.
This is a tool found in the xpdf tootbox. It converts each page of the
scanned pdf file to a one-page pbm file, each of which can then be
individually run through gocr. For this pdf file, I'll have 129 output files
so I'll throw together a shell script to process each file.

  This restores my faith in linux/FOSS: there _is_ a way to do almost
everything.

I don't think he was saying that, though - he was saying, "If you're going

I'm not worried about the resources, just having it out to save the
potential for errors, sounds like too much hassle to avoid a _potential_
problem.

I am a chip designer and a hardware weenie - sometimes it seems I
can't write a "hello world" program and get it to compile.  That
said, I have recompiled Linux kernels to add and subtract features -
the procedures described in the Redhat reference manual are pretty
good.  The kernel sources install easily from an RPM (as opposed to
the *.src.rpm files, which are a bit trickier) and the procedure is
a series of simple and reversable (if slow) steps.  The main thing
you need is patience, a good procedure for saving .config files, 
and about 300MB of space in /usr/src .  Redhat 7.1 uses grub, and
that makes it easy to add an alternate kernel for testing, then
switch over once you are satisfied.

Learning how to compile and install a kernel is an empowering thing -
you have ultimate power over the core of your own machine.  It is
kind of like sex;  after your first time, the world looks different.
You will have a much better understanding of *why* GNU/Linux is there
and why so many people spend so much time adding to it.  

The Linux Clinic is probably a good place to do this (if you have
a slow machine, get there early;  this could take a while).  I'm 
sure the folks running the clinic will get the a voyeuristic thrill
out of helping a "kernel virgin" through their first time.  Much
better than helping find some obscure hardware flaw.  Take notes!

Finally, regards USB and Hotswap - the 7.1 Redhat kernel probably
didn't do that very well, it gets better in later kernels.  But it
is handy - I use USB2 hotswap on my server, as part of my disk-to-disk
backup system.  I am running a 2.4.20 kernel with custom mods and
patches, and *.20 does single-drive USB2 hotswap pretty well.  See
my page  http://www.keithl.com/linuxbackup.html  (under development).

I'm not saying you should keep USB - you should learn to compile
it out, then compile and run a more recent kernel (they are usually
backwards compatable), then learn to modify the new one, then add
USB2 back.  Not because any of this is necessary to running an
off-the-CD distro, of course, but because it is *fun*. 

Compiling kernels - do it with someone you love, today!

I'd guess that kudzu is looking for new hardware, and also that usb is all
done through modules.

Try putting this in your /etc/modules.conf
  alias usb-controller off

Note that I haven't done this myself, it's just my best guess.

If I were setting up a server, the first thing I would do would be to
recompile my kernel for the hardware it was made up from, and only that
hardware.

Why don't you want to recompile your kernel?  :-)

As somebody else suggested, USB might be (is probably?) being loaded up
as a module.  Do an lsmod to see if that's the case, then use RH's
module setup to disable those modules from automatically loading.

This should work, although you may want to run the output through some
perl/sed/whatever to make it into a simple file list:

find $HOME ! -type d | xargs file | grep script

Sounds to me like a chipset issue, as well.  It looks *a lot* like the
errors I get with my SD11 and VA-503+ motherboard-based systems with
*any* default 2.4.x kernel.

Do you know what IDE chipset you're running there?

On the above mentioned systems, they usually boot, or get halfway
through booting before the chipset just finally gives up and stops
serving any data at all, spewing forth messages like that constantly.

When I run file on an RH 9.0 system, the output looks like:

script.sh	Korn shell script text executable
script		Bourne shell script text executable
script.pl	a perl  script text executable
text.txt	ASCII text
etc.

...so I can see which is which.  Does your version of 'file' not do this?

Why not just disable USB in the system BIOS. Then the system won't try to load the module for USB. I do the same thing for IDE controllers and it seems to work fine.

It talks about an evil bit which essentially seems to suggest
a packet be labeled as to it's intent.  Considering that any
protocol can be run through any port if I'm not mistaken, isn't
the API to label packets as friendly or evil going to be hard
to implement?  This is more than fixing dns as it suggests a
way to have intermediary servers label the packets of malicious
transmissions, but isn't it going to involve forcing ISP's and 
others to do certain things which haven't happened for dns?
Is it really possible for the Internet backbone to do baseline
packet filtering for malicious packets going through it?

We don't even have legit sites such as schools running proper
reverse zones where my ISP controls my PTR zone.  As long
as they aren't abusive with the information, I can't be
either.

One oddity with monster.com is that their reverse record is to
a different name than their A record is from.  I can resolve 
monster.com to a number where that number resolves to a
different name.  Is this a correct configuration?  Why would 
someone set up their dns this way?

Sure spam can come from valid addresses, so far I haven't had
much trouble with that though.  I'm not just after filtering,
I want to unsubscribe from spam also whenever possible as the
loss of good bandwidth is another issue.  You want the
blocking of a spammer to get as close to the spammer as 
possible.  Even if that means that the local police at this 
person's location visit him/her.

The prupose of wanting correct dns is to be able to detect
where a message is coming from, this doesn't take into account
though that a spammer could forge a valid address of some other
place.  If a site spamming you won't deal with abuse
where else can you send a complaint?  I'm talking UCE or
even worse.

This has a pretty good chance of not working, once linux is booted, it
doesn't care what the BIOS settings are, it still looks for the devices
and gets them working if it can.  I've had IDE devices do this too
(turned off in the BIOS, but found as the kernel boots up).

The important bit is the "Domain of sender address ... does not
resolve".

They have their mail server (hercules.syi.pcc.edu[209.152.61.185])
configured to look up the sending domain. 

Now, I just tried it, and robinson-west.com doesn't resolve, even though
goose.robinson-west.com does. (Results below)

I suggest adding an A record for robinson-west.com, and see if that
doesn't help.

How do you do that?  I've never added a record for a hostname of " ".domainname.
I'm using bind 8.4.  I wonder what address I should set it to?  Should
it be the network address?

Since you apparently didn't get the gist of rfc3514, you might want to
refer to this one.

This is normal - consider hosting multiple email/web/whatever domains on
a single host with a single ip address. Many many different dns A
records can point to the same IP address, but a reverse or PTR record
for an IP can only return one host name.

That's what I would guess, although, there's probably an RFC that covers
this. :)

I only have one ip, so my domain is set with an A record pointing to
that. 

As per the DNS how-to, I don't have any cname records. Everything is an
A record, even though I only have one ip. 25 names, 25 A records, one ip
address.

Is it a co-incidence that there are 42 characters, including spaces, in the following sentence:

Subject: [PLUG] Procmail Ignores Rule
Message-ID: <1065035590.23326.306.camel@sparticus>

All,

First, I have an environment variable in /etc/procmailrc that grabs the
"user" portion of the recipient's email address:

  # The recipient's address
  ENV_TO=$1

I have this rule so that all emails addressed to "good at host.domain.com"
are placed in the /var/spool/mail/reported_good file:

:0: fwh
  * ^To: good at host.domain.com
  /var/spool/mail/reported_good

Fine. I know this worked before I added the rule outlined below.

Now, I want to say, "If the sender's address isn't good at host.domain.com,
forward the rest of the mail to user at forward_host.domain.com after
having first re-written the "To:" field (remember the "$ENV_TO" variable
I mentioned above. Never mind why...well, okay, it's because Exchange is
stupid:

  :0 fwh
     | formail -I"To: "$ENV_TO"@"
     :0
       ! "$ENV_TO"@forward_host.domain.com

The only trouble is that even though the "To:" rule is above the
"$ENV_TO" rule, procmail simply grabs onto the "ENV_TO" rule and
processes it first!

Would anyone like to give me a clue why the latter rule is processed
before the first rule?!!?


Best,

In your zone file for robinson-west.com:

@	IN	A	209.210.202.172

If that in fact is what the problem is, it is pretty broken for pcc.edu
to use that as a requirement for accepting mail.

probably not, because each $i will have a format like 'foo.pbm', and your
do line will try to read foo.pbm.pbm and write to foo.pbm.txt.

Using bash's parameter substitution capabilities, you probably want to do
something like this:

for i in *.pbm; do
	j=${i%%.pbm}.txt
	gocr -o $j -i $i
done

the second line says, "take whatever's in $i, chop off .pbm from the end,
feed the results into $j, and tack on .txt".

Cooper,

I suspect what's happening is that the To: rule is being processed - but in
procmail's cache. The second recipe doesn't see that change. I believe what
you need to do is let your MDA do the rerouting to the new delivery address.
Try...

    # deliver it
    :0 w
    ! -t

...instead of your second rule. Have your set VERBOSE=yes to see exactly
what's happening?

Sandy

actually, you know, I forgot to ask: have you tried adding a boot arg

a) that's not what backticks are for (if you don't know what they do,
   you shouldn't be using them);

b) $1 is a typo;

c) .pbm is already part of what I assume you intended to be $i; and

d) (as stated elsewhere) $i.txt should probably be ${i%%.pbm}.txt.

Yeah, RH announced the end of retail awhile back.  I prefer to use 
store-bought media for OS installs.  The homemade disks often have problems. 
  Plus you'd get a bumbersticker or something.

 From the article, "Fedora will be more bleeding edge and, therefore, 
possibly less stable and less secure than Red Hat Linux."

Sounds like irresponsible FUD, but will be determined in time.

Thinking of finding a new distribution.  Any one have any recomendations? 
Kidding.

Over the weekend I DL'd and made CDs and installed RH9 (Shrike).  Works
like a champ, with only 2 issues (and those, I'm sure are Linux newbie
issues, but I'll detail them anyhow).  I have an old IBM LaserPrinter 5E
(it's a Lexmark 4029-010) and I can't make it work.  Also, I haven't
figured out how to enable the digital audio out to my digital spkrs on a
SoundBlaster Live! card (analog headphones work fine).  I've used
several distros, starting with an old SlackWare, but this is the
<easiest> so far...

This isn't a slam on SuSE, they have their good points. I have a couple
of SuSE boxes, as well as RH, Mandrake, Turbo, and various others. 

The only problem I have with SuSE, is that you can't get a "real" set of
CD's from them without purchasing a box. 

The demo they have is a demo iso, and runs from the CD. 

You can install over the net, but that's long and virtually requires
broadband. Not something I have everywhere I want to install. 

I've burned a few coasters, but in the long run, I've had very little
trouble with burned media. Basically, check the MD5 after burning.

Well, I thought I found the problem. The Debian kernel images have the
following config option:

# CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND is not set

So I compiled a new kernel, with everything else the same, but

CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND=y

But I still get 

cat: /proc/acpi/sleep: No such file or directory

and echo 1 > /proc/acpi/sleep gives me

bash: /proc/acpi/sleep: No such file or directory

So nothing's changed. 

For people curious, the reason I'm harping on this is that with the 2.6
kernel my computer is actually usable again, as far as a desktop is
concerned (in comparison, the 2.4 kernels are slower than beyond belief,
even with the preempt patch applied). Of course, there's still this
problem, and the problem of the Synaptics Touchpads not working because
the only driver for them in XFree86 is experimental, and they stopped
doing the psaux emulation of them in the 2.6 series.

So...for desktop users, try upgrading to 2.6. For laptops, well...good
luck. It's absolutely amazing the difference.

You probably want to read the docs on software suspend that came with
the kernel source.  I don't think it has to do with ACPI (or
APM).. hence the "software" aspect, it was designed to work regardless
of the hardware.

Not that this isn't a solution, it just may not be what you expect.

Subject: [PLUG] ext3 journal fixable?
Message-ID: <002c01c3889c$64d6f2b0$570a0a0a@GATH>

After being forced to power down my RedHat Linux 8.0 box without doing a
proper halt or reboot, the system comes back up and naturally starts checking
the filesystems.  The first 3 partitions are fine, but I get an error on the
4th:

fsck.ext3: Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read while
checking ext3 journal for /home

All the stuff I've read so far on ext3 is just praising its stability--with
few clues on how to fix a journal file.

Can this be fixed?  Any hints would be wonderful!


Thanks,

David Cornelius

Message-ID: <20031002053452.GB31254@gate.kl-ic.com>

< Redhat becomes Fedora ... >

I buy Redhat for the network effect - my solutions help others, their
solutions help me.  Also, they have from time to time helped me 
resolve problems.  

The move towards Fedora will probably destroy the network built up 
around Redhat - there won't be a lot of newbies asking stupid questions
about Fedora, so I won't be as likely to find the answers I need to
the same stupid questions by searching the web.  I can afford Enterprise,
but most of the newbie network can't.

Redhat has usually been about the right distance back from the
brink of the bleeding edge.  Also, I am one of those benighted fools
who has tried both KDE and Gnome and likes Gnome a little better.  

Suse seems a little more bleeding edge, while Debian-stable seems to
be built like a tank in an age of aircraft.  I know I ought to like 
Debian better.  I tried running Suse for a while;  configs and such
weren't where I expected them to be, and of course Suse is a little
more geared towards KDE.  

So the Redhat move has me a little worried, yes.  But I think it will
create opportunities.  The need for a domestic boxed distro hasn't
gone away, and maybe Debian will move into that slot.  Manual sets?
I assume Tim O'Reilly can do a better job, especially if he buys the
rights to the Redhat set as a starting point.  Also, this makes a
Cygnus Solutions style support business just that much more
attractive.   Perhaps a bunch of you unemployed types should make
contact with the folks out at Stream about setting up a 1-900 Linux
support group for Fedora.  More ideas in a following email.

When it all settles out, the new possibilities will be great, because
open source permits rapid commercial innovation.  But for now, the
uncertainty about new directions is difficult to live with.

The perly ways are probably the ways I'd do it... or use my copy of sed
which includes a friend's patch so that it takes a perl-like -i switch.

Have you considered just sucking down the pages with wget using the -k
option (--convert-links)?

>From `man wget`:
       -k

       --convert-links
           After the download is complete, convert the links in
           the document to make them suitable for local viewing.
           This affects not only the visible hyperlinks, but any
           part of the document that links to external content,
           such as embedded images, links to style sheets, hyper-
           links to non-HTML content, etc.

           Each link will be changed in one of the two ways:

           o   The links to files that have been downloaded by
               Wget will be changed to refer to the file they
               point to as a relative link.

               Example: if the downloaded file /foo/doc.html
               links to /bar/img.gif, also downloaded, then the
               link in doc.html will be modified to point to
               ../bar/img.gif.  This kind of transformation works
               reliably for arbitrary combinations of directo-
               ries.

           o   The links to files that have not been downloaded
               by Wget will be changed to include host name and
               absolute path of the location they point to.

               Example: if the downloaded file /foo/doc.html
               links to /bar/img.gif (or to ../bar/img.gif), then
               the link in doc.html will be modified to point to
               http://hostname/bar/img.gif.

           Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a
           linked file was downloaded, the link will refer to its
           local name; if it was not downloaded, the link will
           refer to its full Internet address rather than pre-
           senting a broken link.  The fact that the former links
           are converted to relative links ensures that you can
           move the downloaded hierarchy to another directory.

           Note that only at the end of the download can Wget
           know which links have been downloaded.  Because of
           that, the work done by -k will be performed at the end
           of all the downloads.

This is not true. A reverse lookup may return numerous PTR records.
Whether the software asking the question will understand multiple
answers is another matter.

Why not set it to the address of your Web server (if you have one)?
Then configure your Web server for robinson-west.com as well as
www.robinson-west.com. People will be able to access your Web pages
without having to type the www part.

Amen to that. My oldest daughter has worked there for several years and 
she describes quite the cesspool of corporate mismanagement and employee 
abuse. Personally, I think the IWW (Wobblies) ought to plant a couple of 
folks out there and try and organize it. Stream is as good an argument 
for the union as any I have seen in the computer industry.

No and yes.

The system works.  It just doesn't do what you want it to do right now.

As I've written a million times before, efficiency is a red herring.

Efficiency is a quality of an entire system.  Your computer is just one
small part of the system.  Accepting the data and then deleting it may not
be efficient in your little closed space, but that approach makes the
whole system of email delivery VERY efficient and effective because it
ensures that all mail gets delivered.  If there is then a failure, it is
your fault in the deleting.

Effective is more important than efficient.

Efficiency isn't something that a person can imbue.  It is something that
is born of complexity and evolves.

I've never considered SuSE bleeding edge but they sure do a nice job of 
supporting their distos for at least two years. I just got notice that 
they're dropping support for SuSE 7.2 now that 9.0 is going to be 
released. 

That still leaves versions 7.3, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, and 9.0 with support. I 
don't know how that compares with RedHat but I did see that RedHat is 
EOL'ing all their 7.x versions the end of this year IIRC.

I've been mostly working with SuSE for the last 5 years but I work with 
several RedHat servers at work and they aren't all that different IMHO. 
I've had no problems configuring the RedHat boxes although it's 
different in the way some of the config stuff is handled so I've had to 
do a little searching on a few things.

Debian is actually newer than any other distro out there.  Stop
thinking "stable" and try "unstable" sometime.  Stable is maintained
for the sake of people who need absolute stability and new users,
unstable is more geared towards the lunatic fringe.

Not normally.  You either get what will be the next stable, or you get
stable.  Right now, there's testing, which will become frozen any time
now, which is the closest you'll get.

Why would you need something in the middle?

Because getting money to deploy something that is advertised as 
"unstable" is much harder than getting money for something "stable", but 
you might need something newer than "stable".

Don't forget about "testing".  It is a good compromise between the
lunatic fringe and the old stable stuff.  Start with "stable", if it
doesn't have what you need, then try "testing".  If that doesn't have
what you need, then try "unstable".  FYI, the "old-stable" (potato) is
still getting security updates.

Not true.  Recent experience with gentoo indicates that, for example,
ssh updates came through faster on gentoo than on Debian unstable.
Gentoo has Xfree 4.3, while Debian unstable is still (seven months
later) on Xfree 4.2.

And yet, I still like Debian, even without the exaggerations.

News to me.  Testing has been around for quite a while (3 years?).
Can you point to where you got the idea that "testing" is "temporary"?

A year and a half, two tops, IIRC.

Prior experience.  Unstable forks a testing, which rolls over to
frozen, which then becomes stable by bumping the incumbent stable into
the archive.  testing and frozen have been mutually exclusive so far,
and it's usually several weeks to months before a new Testing forks
off.

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix relaying...
Message-ID: <1065093333.3394.33.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I forget how to detect if a postfix server is an open 
relay.

I've gotten a null client going, but I'm wondering how 
set up relaying or secondary exchangers for my mailhub.  



The strange thing on my gateway is that I was blocking 
loopback traffic yet it was still working.  Couldn't 
figure out why the host lookups to my fast gateway's 
internal dns were so slow.  I figure my 386 server 
shouldn't outrun a Pentium III. :-)

If I queried my fast gateway's dns when loopback was 
blocked from another server I could resolve names quite 
fast.  Why would you block 127.0.0.0/8 addresses?  That 
must have been a mistake in the iptables firewall I was 
looking at.  As far as what test-net and other blocks
are that are "bad," where can I get a good list to verify
the other rules in this firewall?  I've done some change
to it which makes it easier to see what rules go to which
protocol at the expense of multiple files instead of just 
one.  Then again, the sourcing section where I stamp
in the other files gives a quick glance at supported
protocols, which is nice.  I'm not a big fan of long
scripts or programs anyways.  On the upside, my 
add/remove forwarding for a single host command works 
quickly for the first time as I'm not waiting to time out
anymore every time I run it.

BTW, I have the source tree I installed sendmail-8.12.9 from.
Is there an easy way to remove the files sendmail installed
from a make command or something in case I missed one?
I could do rpm -qf on every file on the hard drive, but 
there could easily be a lot of files that aren't owned 
by any rpm.

I installed Redhat 7.3's Postfix to Redhat 7.2, seems to
work right.  I had to replace chkconfig with the
7.3 version along with db3 and db3-devel to get Postfix on
there.  After that, I manually created the same accounts for 
Postfix that were on an actual Redhat 7.3 server right down
to the user and group ids.

SuSE has always been my favorite commercially-oriented Linux distro., but

But hey, if you're looking for new OSes to try, I have to get a plug in

I thought the Enterprise Edition, if it's worth the extra money, paid
for the lower cost version.  I've bought boxed sets, do they really
lose too much money?  I think part of the problem is that there has
been too much focus on emulation and not enough on moving people
to new software where your company can program for Linux from
day one and do better programming.

One problem I see is that there needs to be more focus on getting
Linux considered first.  Seems like Linux distributions are unfairly
having to adapt to new hardware at a disadvantage because the
information to do this either has be hacked out of electronic
devices or developers have to wait for it to be made more broadly
available.

A lot of people aren't considering Linux because there is a software
environment where still for the most part only people willing to
go out on the net for software can really get it.  This
becomes more true with the discontinuation of a low cost boxed 
Redhat product.  

The other problem area is how instabilities are integrated into Linux
distributions.  The ideal way to do this is to make any instability  
easily removable or circumventable without making a future fix of
the problem more difficult or cumbersome than it has to be.  I 
wonder what would happen if Redhat did a $100/year subscription 
for a well ironed out, reasonably cutting edge, distribution without
tying anyone in to a proprietary quagmire?  This is about what 
Windows users are shelling out, isn't it?  The focus should be 
not only more stable, but also easier to learn how to administrate 
and reliable local support.  How many people are unhappy about not
having a place to go to take their computer, tell someone what they 
want, and know they can pick it up later with the confidence the 
job was done right?  If it can be shown Linux provides a better
software environment than Windows and the Internet is grounded to
standards that are not Miroshaft centric, Linux really has a
chance to compete.  And not only Linux, but all the other
alternatives as well that have been languishing.  One thing Linux
users should be able to afford is training, but it's going to take
advertinsing to develop demand for any such service and the focus
has to be using the money you save on cheaper licensing and greater
freedom get this training.  

My dad won't try to move to Linux talking
about picking up an expensive subscription for Windows software
even though I have told him have a dozen things have been done
to his computers that are flat wrong by a certified Windows 
system builder who should know better.  I have no MCSE, but
I know this guy is screwing up big time.  I also know my
dad is talking a lot of money for software that probably 
won't be worth what he'll pay for it.

His hard drive failed, but he didn't even come to me to 
get it fixed.   I know what kind he needed and even where 
to get one because I've been working on making his machine 
not only fixable but Linux compatible too.  His complaint 
is that he can't come to me because he doesn't want to rely 
on me.  That said, he got a hard drive his motherboard and 
even on board upgrade card won't support properly where the 
drivers this dork installed are totally the wrong ones.
It cost my dad $140 where I could have gotten the right
hard drive twice as big for $80 and fixed it right.

Red Hat has been at least vaguely resembling profitable for quite some
time now.  I know it's an understatement to say the Red Hat IPO did
gloriously well.  I'm not sure there's words in the English language
that describe just how well Red Hat did at IPO.

Fortunately, some people have gone out and actually written an IDE
that I can tollerate, and is fairly welcoming to new users.  kdevelop
fits this nicely and I hope to see it grow, though I hope people don't
forget the necessity of staying small and doing one thing well instead
of a dozen craptastically.

Because at the time LinuxCare was launched, there was relatively
small amounts of Linux installed in environments that had the
money to pay for support. While there was lots of Linux running
in Corporate America, most of it did not get there as a result
of dictums from upper management. IT staff and middle managers
installed it on their own initiative using existing budgets.

Of course, Linux is more popular now and a Linux support organization
would likely do better. Still, a support
organization will have to be bootstrapped and there may not be
tons of money to be made - at first or ever. But there should
be enough to live on for an organization that's not top heavy
like LinuxCare.

Yes, testing, aka Sarge. Libranet 2.8 is Sarge-based, and it works fine. The 
main drawback is Sarge security updates are a lot slower than stable (Woody). 
However Libranet issues security patches swiftly. I use plain-vanilla Woody 
for servers, and Libranet for desktop systems. 

Unstable (Sid) usually works fine, but when it blows up, it's spectacular.

Alex,

	I'm just going to go out on a limb and assume the laptop is either brand new or
that you have flashed your bios. My 1100 worked fine right out of the box, but the newer
ones have a new bios that really messes up video support not only in Linux, but in Windows.
You probably haven't noticed in Windows because Dell has made their own driver for the card.
The stock intel drivers will no longer work. The good news is that there is a patch for it.
Go to this website for lots of helpful information.
	Once you get that fixed, if you need anything like XF86Config files or Kernel config
files (for the 2.6 kernels, anyway) just let me know. Mine's running quite nice now.

I haven't tried it, but it seems like it should work if you mount it as
ext2, then delete the .journal file, then run "tune2fs -j
/dev/devicename" to remake the journal.

Message-ID: <36953.68.107.223.201.1065117789.squirrel@webmail.pdxlug.org>

Let's say you have an HTML document with two frames, a top and a bottom. 
A large JPG is displayed in the lower frame and the browser scrollbars
allow you to move around to see the image.

Next, would it be possible to have navigation elements within the webpage
that would move the image to a particular x,y coordinate for you?

As an example, let's say I have a list of items in a menu.  Clicking on
each item would scroll to the portion of the image that corresponds with
the menu item.  There would have to be some logic built in that said "Menu
item 3 is at x,y coordinate 400x250", of course.

Any ideas?  I'm not too concerned about which language would be needed to
accomplish this, as long as it can work in a web browser.  I've been using
ImageMagick to dynamically crop the image to the location I want and then
display that new image, but that's painfully slow, especially if the user
wants to move through the menu items at any reasonable speed.
Thanks,
~M

Yes. The answer, as some have said, is testing. 

Testing was introduced a few years ago with the intent of providing a
step between unstable and stable. There were no plans, as far as I know,
for it to go away. There will be a frozen (and there has never before
been a frozen and a testing, but there will be now) because testing was
introduced with the intention of providing users who didn't want to
trust unstable with a little testing.

If you want to know what it actually is, here's the current standard:
unstable is where the developers put updates and new packages. Testing
is anything that was in unstable for two weeks and passed the build
system in that time. So testing is two weeks behind unstable. Which is
usually enough.

There is a movement to use experimental more, so code snapshots, things
which are truly the bleeding edge, will more and more be put into
experimental (hopefully), and there is no automatic method for moving
from experimental to unstable.

With that said, I use unstable, generally. Sometimes when you apt-get
update && apt-get dist-upgrade, you'll get caught in a bad place for a
little while. But most of the time, you don't. 

Now, if only someone would rewrite apt-get to allow it to rollback
previous actions. If anyone else is interested in this project, tell me
and maybe we could actually do it. I just don't have the energy to do it
myself.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux support business
Message-ID: <20031002182403.GA3480@gate.kl-ic.com>

This is an elaboration of an earlier suggestion about forming a Linux
support company.  As others have pointed out, places like Linuxcare
haven't managed to fill this niche, and places like Stream are hell
to work for.  The first question to ask before starting any unique
venture is "why hasn't this already been done?"  If the answers seem
to involve dark conspiracies or mass evil, then this indicates a need
for psychiatric help, not a business startup loan.  I won't go into
details of starting a business, there are books out there for that,
and if we can't roughly agree on that information it is a waste of
time to proceed here.  So let's proceed on the assumption that normal
business principles ( legality, profitability, salability, productivity,
scalability, tolerability, etc. ) apply.  If you want to argue with
those, go start your own business, succeed, and write your own books.
At least, start your own thread about the wickedness of commercialism;
we are focused on a different problem here.

Since this is an innovation in software, I would suggest reading the
books "The Inmates are Running the Asylum" by Alan Cooper, and "The
Innovators Dilemma" by Clayton Christensen. The first book is about
product design for use, with a focus on software;  the second is about
how "cheap plus good enough" takes over existing niches.  You can find
out a lot more about these two books by Googling. 

A business solves the problems that others perceive, in return for
their money.  While that process can get mighty distorted, you do
not succeed by betting against it.  So the question is, whose money
do we want, and what problems do they have that we can solve?

Companies and rich people have money.  We want them to give us some
of that money.  They also have problems, some of which have Linux
solutions.  We can solve those problems.  At some point, we can also
solve consumer problems, but consumers have more varied problems and
their individual piles of money are smaller and more trouble to get
at.  It will take a fairly large service company to serve consumers,
and we aren't there yet.  However, when we go after the big piles
we face some competition;  we have to look for those piles where we
face less competition.  If we can manage to keep those simple facts
in mind, we can build a business.

I suspect the biggest available piles with low competition are 5-50
employee companies in the category "other".  They are big enough to
have a company network, there are no targeted software solutions
(restaurants, medical offices, auto shops, etc. already have solutions,
though weak ones), and chances are the owner or manager also spends
time taking care of the damned computers - when they should be growing
the business, so they have more money to pay us.  

So the "avatar" customer (see Cooper) is a middle-aged small entrepreneur,
fairly tight with money, who wants to get more out of her computers
with less time spent.  She doesn't want problems, but she doesn't care
about manuals and RFCs and standards (that's OUR problem).  The company
must be able to share data with suppliers and customers using Windoze,
Mac, etc.  The employees use email and the web (browsing and website),
and most are not computer-hygenic.  While she would probably like
specialized software focused on her individual business, it isn't
there yet.  She probably needs Quickbooks running under Wine, so we
can't afford ideological purity.

All that said, we can keep the machines up, provide basic applications, 
keep viruses out, write little functional scripts to solve point tasks,
and do 24x7 maintenance far more effectively and cheaply than she can
get the same things done with a Windoze solution.  Maybe we don't have
the chrome, or the games, or the industry-specific apps (though many
of those can run under Wine or Win4Lin or even offsite).  We cannot
give a flashy demo, so we will have to trade on our strengths -
FREEDOM, availability, adaptability, and - potentially - attitude. 

Attitude will be the big challenge - software people are intellectually
smart, and this leads to bad attitudes and ego.  Nobody pays for that.
In years past, Microsoft displayed slightly less attitude during the
critical growth period of the industry.  Because they were slightly
less disgusting for users than their competitors (or at least convinced
people of that, which amounts to the same thing in business), they
captured the desktop, and captured the interchange standards, and now
own the commons.  So they are now back to the "screw you, luser"
mentality, and act like they are invulnerable.  This is a hell of an
opportunity for folks who are smart enough to write and support code
that turns lusers into winners.  I think, with some attitude adjustments,
we are those smart people.

The first thing needed are enough friendly, generalist problem solvers
to form a 24x7 2x redundant first-response phone/web team.  Asterisk
might make a good rallying point.  Can Squeak Smalltalk be made to run
as a background process, and drive browser windows?  I understand Smalltalk
is good for rapid prototyping, which will be needed for numerous point
solutions and quick-fixes.  The day team will need folks that can meet
with customers, learn their needs, and code them rapidly.  Of course,
we will have VPN tunnels into customer machines, and some fairly
fine-grained permission systems to maintain customer security.  That will
need some backroom geeks, but not many.  As things evolve and the process
scales, we will need to develop securely accessable customer profiles, so
strangers can help strangers.  And we will need ways to profitably exchange 
point apps and code modules with other service providers, so we can
maintain profitability as we expand downwards towards the complexity
of individual consumers. 

Well, that is an awfully long ramble.  Perhaps we can discuss it more
tonight, at the Lab.

I use it all the time, since many of my workstations are based on eight
year old IDE drives that have been stuffed in questionable storage areas
for much of that time.

The only problem is every now and then I'll "lose" one partition off of a
disk and then I need to dig up the command to use to reinstate it.  I
don't know what causes the RAID system to think the partition is bad, but
it seems to happen even without any I/O errors logged.

I was just thinking about that same idea only minutes before I got this 
message.  I wonder how much demand there would be for such a service, at 
least initially, because Linux users still tend to be mostly fringe 
people who can solve their own problems and businesses are likely to 
find gurus out there who would gladly work for a reasonable wage right 
now, but that will change some day (hopefully soon) whenever the economy 
picks up.

Linux has only been embraced by certain businesses, although it seems to 
be growing.  Another huge market would be government if anyone can ever 
convince state and local governments that wasting our money on systems 
that are full of problems and then wasting more of our money on 
high-paid "experts" to fix those problems is a bad idea.  I know about 
this first hand, my dad used to be the CIO for another state.  (I never 
heard if the Oregon legislature voted to start using open source 
software whenever possible like they were discussing earlier this year.)

I had another thought too.  While you are right that the money to 
support such a venture would have to come from wealthier individuals and 
companies, reaching out to individual users, non-profits, schools, 
libraries, etc. would affect greater numbers of people.  And the way I 
see it, it is kind of in the open source spirit to make such a service 
availabe to all users.  So I had an idea about how this might be done 
and still remain profitable.

Create a for-profit business that would make money from supporting 
companies, governments, and wealthier individuals.  Create an affiliated 
501c4 (or other type of non-profit?) that could have a few paid 
employees (more like entry level positions, interns, etc.) and charge 
people based on income level, system, type of support/problem, number of 
computers, or some other criteria.  I believe there are ways that you 
can deduct money donated to a 501c4, but if that would be a problem I am 
sure there is some other way around it (a 501c2 perhaps??).  Charging 
people an affordable fee for service would minimize the expense of 
subsidizing the non-profit while providing a deduction for the portion 
that was subsidized.  Then you would have two distinct enterprises and 
two distinct markets and would be supporting the entire Linux community.

I think it is a good idea to make something like this grow out of the 
Linux community rather than letting venture capitalists come in and 
saturate the support market as Linux becomes more popular and try to 
water it down to support their own personal business interests (not that 
they could ever do that, but they would certainly try).

Anyway, that was the idea that I had just this morning.

I'd say the answer is simple: we are computer nerds, not salesmen.

I doubt any of us (okay, I'll admit I'm talking about me) find any
enjoyment calling strangers about 75 times a day, dealing with the
inevitable rejection, in order to get to the one or two interviews
that might actually lead to a sale. And if one doesn't get the sales,
how is one to get the work?

Yes, there are people who hang out a shingle, & get a steady stream
of computer-related work. But their customers are the ones who say,
``Gimme some of that stuff I saw on tv last night." And they're talking
about Microsoft-oriented software & hardware -- which is what gets
advertised.

So how do we sell the salesmen on the idea?

Gosh, Keith, you mean Linuxcare didn't come to an untimely end due to
VC mismanagement, which forced them into an MLM scheme to keep their
doors open -- but which only delayed the inevitable? From what I've
read in the media over the last few years, it would seem that Venture
Capitalists are ``mass evil" incarnate. (Or at the least not the
super-businessmen that they've been portrayed to be.)

Unfortunately, Christensen's book has become something of a cliche. He
presented his thesis in a simple, and convincing manner, but the thesis
can be explained in a few sentences. I'd say that it is describing
the situation Microsoft is facing right now -- that not only is Open
Source less expensive & at least as good as many Windows-based
solutions -- but their own business model has locked them into a
strategy that is growing less effective in competing with Open Source
on a daily basis.

I think it's not a statement of faith to say that Open Source
solutions will eventually push out traditional MS software in all
significant software catagories, but an accurate fact. However,
it's also a fact that unless one of us figures out how to use this
to make a living & shares the secret, none of us will benefit from
this deveopment. (Unless you can afford to short MS stock over a
sufficiently long term basis.)

Like most things, it depends on the job that needs to get done.  The
Linux implementation of software RAID doesn't have much overhead, which
is good, but it does seem to have some minor problems.  However, I've
found that once the RAID is configured and synced, it works quite well. 
I don't like the hoops that need to jumped through to get a software
RAID device to boot.

The biggest advantage is $$$.  IDE drives are not just inexpensive (the
I in RAID), they are getting to be downright cheap.  This is a very
small cost for an added layer of recoverability (this is not a
substitute for regular backups).  For workstations and low overhead
servers, I have a hard time justifying NOT setting up mirrored
partitions these days.

Yup, it's a nice thing to have, for all the reasons you said.

Well, I suppose if I wanted to be overly pedantic, I would say "even with a 
RAID controller, software is running the show." :)  I think for hardworking 
servers it's more important to have SCSI drives, RAID or not. And I agree 
that a good hardware RAID controller is a lovely thing to have.

I have been running Debian since '98.  I would run stable on my servers, and
unstable on my workstation.

Only twice did an 'apt-get update' cause my workstation to break beyond use.  But, I
waited a day (two at the very most), did another 'apt-get update', and everything
was back to normal.

These days I still run stable on my servers (currently woody), and testing on my
workstations.  No issues.  When testing moves to stable I move my workstations to
stable for 6 months or so before going into testing again.

I've also had very good luck with getting testing/unstable deb's to install in
stable.  Sure there was one time where it kicked off an perl dependency upgrade from
hell, but other than that.. ;)

Why has there been so much talk of buying out or controlling Linux?
Doesn't everyone know that Linux cannot be bought out?  You can't
even sell a proprietary system derived from Linux code only being
able to replace the system libraries and utilities.  The kernel if
it's a true Linux system is going to be open.  It's discouraging
that Sun, Microsoft, etc. are focusing more on being able to sell
proprietary systems in place of OSS than providing services for 
users of OSS.  Is it just me or are we hearing software isn't
"profitable" yet the price of it is steadily increasing? 
I'm starting to wonder how much of that is inflation.

I think a proprietary OS can make it but it's time for a different
business model that is Linux friendly, because Linux is the server
now.

I did this in Java and .gifs in 1996, so there should be a number of
applications that do it.

The tricky thing is that everything must be in Java, since getting
information from one doc (frame) to another, and then into the applet
can proved impossible (esp when you have different browsers, and browser
versions).  "Liveconnect" from Netscape was supposed to fix this, but it
was never rock solid.

I do not know of any browser that scrolls horizontally by anchor.

You might do some trick by breaking the image into tables, and jumping
to a cell.  Or making the "window" of visibility limited to the open
frame, and move when you select or hit the edge, just like mapquest. 
But as you mention it is slow, though with small images, and
precropping, you can speed it up.

Maybe.  Java may well be toast anyway because Sun never let it leave home.  
This has frustrated IBM and other companies that wanted to really push Java 
for years.   Losing its parent could kill it off completely.

I thought that OO.o was more or less independent from StarOffice now and that 
the code base was being hacked by a fairly independent group.

While MS may push C#, I'm not aware of any C# implementations that run on big 
non-Windows backend servers.  Mono is definitely not ready for any kind of 
prime time use.  On Windows platforms, C# will cannibalize VB and C++ more 
than Java I suspect.  Is anyone really deploying much Java on Windows these 
days (apart from the odd applet)?  I know most development of Java is done on 
Windows because that is where the good IDEs are, but deployment?

So, the shops that use Java will probably continue to do so provided that the 
licensing is handled by the company that buys it.  I cannot see Sun's 
management selling off anything to MS even in extremis. I'd guess that IBM 
will pick up Java and then throw it over the wall to some other organization.  
IBM makes a lot of money on Java.

There is also the point that Java on Linux has never been that strong, so if 
Linux is taking over the server world, Java really isn't in the picture 
anyway.

Productivity and Sun were the two reasons that made me shift away from Java 
coding four years ago.  I haven't felt that to be a mistake yet.

If Java sails off into the land where FORTAN and COBOL live, will universities 
still use Java as the primary instruction language in CS courses?

Best,
Kyle

P.S. is anyone else getting a bit nervous at this ongoing shakeout and 
consolidation of the computer hardware and software industry?  There are not 
many companies left.    The whitebox world is the only one I can think of 
where there is actually some competition and margins are so low I cannot see 
how that industry remains in business.

If you want a more up-to-date Debian based distrobution then check out
Libranet (www.libranet.com). It's not free, but it's put together very
well and has newer packages than stable Debian.

Oops, one of those things that goes without saying.  I don't consider
the IDE "RAID Controllers" to be real RAID cards.

As far as I know, the only "real" hardware RAID controllers are SCSI,
the IDE controllers that claim to be hardware RAID controllers are
actually using software to do the controlling (I think this is inherent
in the IDE control scheme, with most of the control on the drive, not
the card).

For a robust configuration, hot-swap RAID, with SCSI drives is the only
way to go.

Some IDE RAID cards do the work on the card and look like one big block
device, just like SCSI RAID cards.  3Ware makes ones like that.  Others
are simply multi-channel IDE cards with a special BIOS to ease booting
from software RAID devices.  Promise makes ones like that.

As an aside, I'd like to note that hardware RAID is not always faster
and easier to manage than software RAID.  It really depends on the card,
driver and application.

That is indeed a good way to go when it fits budget, needs and usage.

Possibly, but quite unlikely. For enterprise and on large scale,
framework supported server side there is .NET and Java.

The reason most Java developers are on Windows has nothing to do with
the development tools. There is Forte, Eclipse and others. They work
beautifully on Linux. 

There are still not many Java client side applications in general. Main
reason is limitations of the GUI (AWT and then Swing). There is a new
star on the Java GUI sky: SWT. It is excellent and may well make the
difference. Eclipse is built using SWT. It is still young but we are
already moving over from Swing. SWT roots to and is backed by IBM btw.

That is true. Java has become a big chunk, not only for IBM.

That's no longer the case. For a while Java even run better on Linux
than on Solaris. Java will grow with Linux on the server side.

Lately, Java has been doing better than expected. This has surprised
analysts who expected .NET to take a bigger chunk out of the Java server
market. One indicator are job openings, and they speak for Java, nation
wide and here in Portland. 

Also, don't forget other areas Java is penetrating quite successfully:
mobile and wireless, and the embedded software field.

You'll sorta have to.  There won't be a testing after sarge freezes

I did quite a bit of work with Swing for a 3 year period and did some 
fairly complex GUIs that were used in a client/server system that 
manages airliner maintenance data. Initially we were using NT 4.0 
clients with 500MHZ PII and things didn't perform all that well. Later 
one when all of the clients got upgraded to 1GHZ PIII running Win2K it 
was hard to tell the difference between the native Window programs or 
the Java ones as the performance of the Swing clients was quite good. 
We used the Java look and feel "Metal" by default so it was obvious we 
were using Java.

The biggest problem for our UI client was that Swing seems to having all 
of the objects holding references to every other object and so the 
swing objects didn't seem to get cleaned up in a timely manner actually 
causing our client to throw OutOfMemoryErrors. I had to write gobs of 
extra code to try to do things like empty  out all of the Containers 
recursively within a window to try to give the GC enough hints that it 
would actually reap the objects. 

I spent weeks running the client through JProbe taking heap snapshots 
and adding code to get things to be garbage collected. The Observable 
pattern is used extensively in the Swing/AWT so objects are holding 
references all over the place which makes it hard to get GC working 
well sometimes. Anyone that says (and I've heard it) "That you don't 
need to worry about memory leaks and other problems in Java." is 
smoking something.

On the server side, where we had no GUI code and only did DB access and 
business rules, we never saw any huge memory leak problems. I found a 
few minor memory leaks with JProbe but nothing compared to what 
AWT/Swing seems to do on its own. I'll have to look at SWT if I work on 
an other Java-based GUI. Lately I've been only doing a bit of EJB work 
in Java and most of my work has shifted over to C++ using Linix and 
Oracle.

C++ was a bit of shock for me after doing nothing but Java programming 
since 1996. Before that I did 5 years of C++ programming under HP/UX 
and thought I knew C++ but it's changed allot with the addition of a 
Standard C++ library. I had a bit of a rocky start but after a couple 
of weeks I've gotten back into the C++ groove and it's been mostly a 
matter of getting up to speed with the STL for me. I've found the 
Josuttis C++ library reference pretty indispensable and I wouldn't be 
as far along on my C++ project had it not been for that book.

Thats a good suggestion--don't know why I didn't think of it.  Then again, I
know just enough to be dangerous and not enough to creatively fix anything
that might arise.

I'll work on this.


Thanks,

Javascript:

window.scrollTo() - for horizontal scrolling
window.scrollBy() - for vertical

I don't have a list of browsers that'll work in, but I believe the last 
few version of IE and Mozilla/Netscape support it, though probably not 
in IE for the Mac (because it IE for the Mac sucks).

That's what weak references are for.  Doesn't Java have weak
references?

Yes Java has weak references. It's been a while since I've looked at the 
Swing code but AFAIK neither AWT or Swing use weak references to hold 
references to other objects. I would expect to see some interesting 
failures if they did since as soon as object only has weak references 
to it, it can get garbage collected. 

For example, if I registered some listener object with a component and 
that component used weak references, I'd have to make sure I didn't 
lose the reference to my registered listener as it would get GC'ed if I 
did. It would make debugging a nightmare as the GUI would quit 
responding to events since the listener I previously registered would 
be non-existent.

At it stands now you can create a listener object reference, add it to 
the list of listeners in a component and then drop the reference to the 
listener in your own code. Everything still works since AWT/Swing 
doesn't appear to use weak references. If the Sun implementers had done 
a few simple things like cleaning up all of the containers of object 
references that are inherent in their GUI components it would have 
helped a great deal in dropping object references thereby forcing 
objects to be reaped by the GC.

JProbe's heap snapshots clearly showed that they didn't do that sort of 
cleanup. It's possible that over time the GUI components would get 
cleaned up. We found that GUI object instead tended to linger around 
far too long and if many windows were opened and closed in a short 
period of time, the huge number of lingering GUI objects caused memory 
problems eventually. 

Just doing simple things like emptying out the Container objects and 
setting object references to null when they were no longer needed helps 
the GC to reap objects more quickly. So for a language that supposedly 
frees the programmer of allot of the responsibility in terms of 
deallocating memory, it's not always the case depending on the quality 
of the classes being used. In may cases I couldn't even find that a 
finalize() method existed on many of the GUI-based classes. :-/

Tony,

Earlier this year I discovered the C++ library ACE and that changed my
C++ world: http://www.cs.wustl.edu/%7Eschmidt/ACE-overview.html. You
sound like one to appreciate the pattern technology and platform
abstraction layer it offers. Enjoy.

Funny you should mention that. Yes I remember the ACE library and I used 
it at at the company that I eventually got sucked into doing Java 
programming with the JDK 1.01. Along the same lines, I've also found 
the GNU Common C++ Library pretty nice for some things. It provides C++ 
wrapper classes around many of the common Unix facilities. 

If we needed to do our own communication between our components I'd of 
used ACE. We've got some Java and C++ code and we've been using CORBA 
as a way of avoiding doing any JNI programming to allow the Java code 
to uses some C/C++ libraries we have to use in our system. We're using 
omniORB 4.x for our C++ code and it works quite well. The JDK 1.4.X 
includes a decent IDL compiler and we haven't had any problems 
generating Java code from our IDL.

I've had to use some Mutexes in my C++ code as omniORB deploys services 
that are multi-threaded and I didn't want to have to make pthread 
function calls directly. The Common C++ library provides some nice 
Mutex and Thread classes that make multi-threaded programming much 
easier IMHO. I think I've been "Java-tized" a bit and so having a 
Thread class is real comforting. :-)

Jon,

    To tell ya the truth, I messed around forever trying to get it to work.
The closest thing I found that was "step-by-step" was at freevo.org and
using their software.  It is pretty good but I never could get XMLTV to work
right with freevo.  So to say the least my dreams of having a mini-itx form
factor computer, tv capture card and 200 gig hard drive sitting on my
television were dashed.  Maybe in anouther 6 months I'll try again.

Not to discourage you or anything, hopefully you'll have better luck.
Freevo and MythTV seemed to be the better solutions.  I'd just go to their
site.

Thank you,

That looks like a good site, thanks.

That's very, very funny, but, oh, the verbosity! If he's really trying
to spend less time at the chalkboard:

  #!/usr/bin/perl
  print map {"I will not throw paper airplanes in class.\n"} (0..499);

or, less elegantly,

  #!/bin/sh
  for n in $(seq 1 500); do
    echo "I will not throw paper airplanes in class"
  done

:-)

Hi,
Just wondering if there is an Open Office/Star Office equivalent to
Visio? I'm just doing some simple flowchart/ERD drawings for school
and I know "Draw" will work for that, but it did raise the question in
class last night if there was an equivalent program.

Thanks in Advance,

   I've not made my own.. I did research it for a while though and 
started making parts lists.  I decided to not do it when I realized that 
I couldn't make a decent capacity/capability one for less than ~$300 
and many, many hours of my time and it still would probably still suck 
compared to a Tivo, so I just ordered a Tivo.

   A big stumbling block (at least for me) was getting a computer case 
that looks somewhat like a piece of AV equipment - those cost nearly as 
much as a Tivo!  I could certainly put up with having a normal computer 
case running the show, but I'd much rather have something that didn't 
look like ass.  The GF wasn't too keen on having one of my salvage 
computer cases sitting under the TV either, even if it could pause live 
TV; she barely puts up with all the computers as it is.

   That doesn't mean I don't want to make my own however - it'd be quite 
fun to do I think!

Harry,

  Dia and sketch are supposed to be. However, let me highly recommend
'tgif'. I don't remember the URL but google turns it up #1. Fast, easy to
use (the meaning of the buttons shows up on the left of the status bar at
the bottom of the window). Of the five vector drawing programs I tried the
past few weeks (the above plus xfig and ide), I like this the best.
Excellent documentation and support from the creator.

I'm taking CS161 this term, just because I haven't ever touched
programming before, and was wholly expecting to begin with a Hello World
program.

No such luck.  :-(

We didn't say Hello World in the first in-class example, and really the
first code we were given just made a sort of adding machine.

That and they're starting us out with C++.

right, you can't just replace references with weak references and

Message-ID: <1065229124.31877.651.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I block spam for a number of my customers. There's been a
sharp increase in spam coming from large ISPs such as
comcast.com and rr.com. One customer now wants to block all
e-mail from any Comcast or Road Runner e-mail address or
IP address. They'll accept mail from these places with their
white list.

I'm at a point where I may do the same. I've built my white
list by sucking e-mail addresses from my address book and
mailing lists. I'd like to add the PLUG list to my white list
as well for those times where PLUG members want to communicate
with me directly. Two questions:

1. Does anybody mind if people on this list have a copy of
   everyone's e-mail address for white list purposes. 

2. Can whoever runs the mailing list produce such a list?

The spammers already have my e-mail address, I'm hardly concerned about you
having my address in a whitelist.  If I want private mail addresses kept
private - I don't advertise them.

The sign up page says "The subscribers list is only available to the list
members.", so since you're a list member, I guess that would be available.

But I would think there would be some method by which you could whitelist by
the "to" line, since it's being sent to plug at lists.pdxlinux.org.

I haven't seen a spam on this list in quite a while.

What's ironic about that to  me - is that rr.com and comcast are both
getting very active in blocking 'noisy' mail servers, and in fact have
blocked our entire half a million ip network based on the mail from a single
open relay.  They actually have a good budget for keeping spam out of their
network from coming in, but apparently your feeling that the spam
originating from their network is too much to handle anymore, hmmm?
interesting to me.

Yeah.  I am thinking it might be expensive.  Even if I could put a
system together for a few hundred dollars, add a tuner card for $150 and
I am way over the price of a TiVo.

My big thing is what happens when TiVo goes under.  Could I get the TiVo
but use one of the free services?  Not sure.

Ed,

  Many of the RBLs that postfix checks from here on incoming mail block
specific IP addresses or originators using comcast, rr and others (including
wanadoo). It's working quite well for me. I get no more spam from them
slipping past the filters than I do from any other place.

There are ways to classify (and filter) spam that are about as effective
as simple whietlists, but are much more flexible and involve much less
fiddling.  And keep in mind that the From: address is generally faked,
often with domain names and addresses that belong to legitimate users.

Try SpamAssassin.

We're talking about a large volume of mail. One goal is to
turn away the spammers before they consume our bandwidth.
Techniques that require us to receive the message before we
decide that they're spam are not acceptable.

I thought that we used similar RBLs. Can you send me your list of
RBLs - privately if you wish?

Spam originating from comcast.com IP addresses has increased at least
tenfold in the past few weeks.

Yes, but is a simple list available or do I have to do some
processing on some HTML rendering of a list? Not that this
is a major issue. I could use more awk practice.

That's not the goal. I sometimes receive mail from list
members who contact me off the list.

Again, that's not germane.

FWIW, I bought my TV tuner card for $45 at Fry's about six months ago,
and just bought one for another system for $50.

They aren't, by any stretch of the imagination, really high quality, but
they certainly get the job done.

I understand.  There are several techniques that work well at that stage.
I'd recommend you look a little further into modern spam-fighting tools
and techniques (especially RBLs) before you invest too much effort.

One bandwidth-saving technique that I'm told works surprisingly well is to
give a temporary (4xx) error to unknown senders.  Spammers rarely retry
errors, so if the sender retries, it's probably OK and can be whitelisted.
(And have its mail subjected to further classification.)

The important bit here is to do something effective without incurring
excessive costs in programming or maintenance time.


The spammers don't deserve it,
  Aaron

main() return value sets $? in the shell. (*cough* (int))
wait 'till you're asked to write a C/C++ program without semicolons,
or swapping the values of 2 variables without using a third|temporary
variable.

if you're really bored, print out the environment variables not using
getenv(3)...

or if you're really, really, really bored.... do a google search for
'quine'

or if boredom has stuck so deep that you're gonna stop reading this
email...check out:

The newline probably wasn't part of his assignment ;)

main(void) is in fact different to main(). Later allows variable
parameters but with void you specifically say no parameters.

You might try the "expand" utility which converts tabs to spaces. By 
default it converts each <TAB> to 8 spaces but I believe you can tell 
it how many spaces you want each <TAB> converted to. If you want to 
convert spaces to <TAB> use "unexpand".

Yeah, I'm getting a lot of it!  

I've found out that the numbers in my postfix maillog and in the postfix
defer and deferred queues match up.  So, I figure if I want a deferred
message out of the system that I can just delete the correct numbered
files from the two queues directly.  Seems like some messages got 
stuck in a bounce to sender loop, the sender address probably bogus.  

How this happened in the first place, I'm not certain since I wouldn't
send email to these addresses where I've always assumed that any
transmit attempt eventually ends with success or failure making
transmission certainly a finite operation.  I worry about being
turned into an open relay.

Is there a utility to give a list of and help me detect what program,
etcetera, is acting as an MUA?  Isn't there anything other than a bounce
that can cause an infinite deferred loop?  You can't source address an
email through two email addresses, can you?  Make the receiver send the
message elsewhere?  Is there an easy way to tell in the maillog if the
message is trying to come in or go out?  I've been working on my maillog
daily so I've been clearing it daily in an attempt to understand what
much of the frankly noise is and clear that noise by limiting what's
logged to a small number of current messages.  I wish I could use
something like webalizer on the logs on my log hub and view those 
on a locked web page.  After that the focus would be to keep the 
html logs backed up and just have the system log storage 
implemented in a queue like fashion where the oldest log 
is the first to be thrown out to clear space for more 
logging, LIFO.

Is there something in the maillog that would say mailx
etc. injected postfix offering perhaps enough info to
verify that that's the mailx etc. I installed and not 
a trojan?

One concern of mine with forging is that bouncing off of  
my email server, someone may have a way to spam others and remain 
undetected.  If a message is legit and it bounces, the bounce is 
helpful as it informs the sender of a problem.  Is there a good
way to program Postfix's bounce procedures getting around the 
possibility of bounce being abused by someone?

Bounce is inappropriate if the address to bounce to is wrong.
If the sender won't take replies, I don't know how Postfix is
configured by default to behave.  For all I know, attempting 
to bounce the spam may in fact trigger further transmission 
of garbage as this reveals that I'm still in existence.  The 
best thing to do is to not reply, don't even bounce spam, 
focus on not granting a connection to the spammer if this 
is at all feasible.

That's a great list, but what's the sure fire bullet proof way to
determine that in fact the domains these black hole servers block 
are ones that should be?  Are these blocks fine grained down to
individual abusive hosts or are they coarser referring to whole
subnets?  What's the cost in network bandwidth of using these
or is there an effective way to cache them in your own local
dns, etc?

I don't believe TiVo is going under anytime soon, I think I read that 
there is now over a million TiVo units out there (mostly due to 
DirecTV's efforts) and at $12/mo/unit I don't expect them to roll up any 
time soon - but I have no real idea of course.

If they do fold I'm actually fairly sure an enterprising hacker will 
figure out how to hack XMLTV into it.

I do think that the only advantage to making your own PVR (and really 
making your own of almost anything) is flexibility of features.  It's 
not cost or convenience, that's for sure.  Right now you can't skip 30 
second blocks on the TiVo (you can on the ReplayTV I think), nor (out of 
the box) move the files off the TiVo and onto your computer's hard 
drive, both of these were done to keep the lawyers off their backs. 
Being a hobbyist at home nobody is going to sue you for making a 30 
second ad skip, or having the ability to click and burn an ad-removed 
SVCD of a show (now THAT would be a cool feature).

There is no sure fire bullet proof way.

You'd have to ask the administrators of the lists. Many or most
of them refer to individual hosts. But some list blocks of IP
addresses for an ISP's dial-up addresses, for example.

A local DNS cache can cache these RBL lookups just like any
other DNS answer. There's nothing special about a RBL lookup
from the point of view of a cache.

I have Red Hat 7.3 installed on one system and am playing around with 
installing Debian 3.0r1 on another system.  Red Hat always recommends 
that you create a boot partition but I can't find any explanation in any 
documentation about the benefit of booting from a seperate partition. 
 Debian's installation guide discusses various partitioning schemes, but 
I haven't found any mention of a boot partition.  Does anyone know of a 
good reason to boot from a seperate partition, or why this seems to be 
only a Red Hat idea?

It's a workaround for older BIOSes that can't boot from high-numbered
cylinders on large hard drives. What Red Hat's installer does is make
sure that /boot is the first partition, guaranteeing that the boot
loader can find the kernel. For an explanation, see the LDP's Large
Disk HOWTO:

  http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Large-Disk-HOWTO.html

If your hardware/BIOS is reasonably recent, it's not an issue.

But at some loss.  The TiVo TV Guide is far better and more complete
than *any* free web guide.  That's worth the $12/month *right there*.

Yes you can.  You have to enable the feature using the well known
"select play select 3 0 select" backdoor, so that probably gets TiVo corp
off the hook for providing a "skip commercials" button.

There's a new product out that is a TiVo bundled with a DVD
burner/player and satellite decoder for about $1000.  So, soon, you'll
be able to burn all your soaps to a DVD to take on a trip.  Not sure
what kind of DRM they'll use.  And if you own two TiVos... you can
already share them with the Home Media Option... record on one TiVo,
play on the other.

It's outdated advice.  Older kernels couldn't read a boot partition past
a low (1K?, 4K?) cylinder boundary, so it was recommended to put a boot
partition lower.  Recent kernels (past 2.2 or 2.4.x?) removed the limit.
You still might want to define one though, if you want it as read-only.

Brian,
I believe that this concept is intended to overcome the limitation of
booting from a partition beyond the 1024th cylinder. Following this idea,
you place a small boot partition somewhere before the 1024th cylinder, then
place everything else wherever you want. I'll be expecting some additional
comments . . .

Sounds as if you are quite a TiVo fan.  Is it really worth $13 per
month?

another good reason for the boot partition is that _most_ systems unmount the 
boot partition right after the machine gets up and running. this way, if your 
filesystem corrupts, your boot partition is sitting off by itself, safe and 
unmounted.

Tony,

  I'll post the solution to this perplexing problem in the hope that others
benefit from what I learned. The problem is that regex search-and-replace
did _not_ work in versions prior to 1.1.0 (or, as it's still known: RC5). I
kept putting '\t' in the search box, checking the regex checkbox widget, and
getting no results.

  So, yesterday afternoon I downloaded the RC5 -- which is the 1.1.0
release, installed it and moved all my templates and configurations to it.
Lo and behold: regex works!

  Now, finding all underlined text and rplacing it with the same text but
not underlined still doesn't work for me, but I'll pass on how to do that,
too, when I learn how.

Thanks for your suggestion,

Rich

Michael,

  As a broad, simple answer to your question: I dunno. They work for me.
However, let me see if I can provide some more useful information.

  First, for the foreign RBLs, the only time I see -- or expect -- messages
from those countries is on a mail list to which I subscribe and they come
through just fine. As far as I'm concerned, coarse is better (you should see
the size of my badip list: 1701 IP addresses and address blocks -- and
growing).

  Second, I very frequently see individual accounts blocked for the major
cable operators: rr.com, comcast.net, adelphia.com and so on. I know these
RBLs (including SpamCop's) are fine-grained enough for me because I get
messages from folks on those domains without explicit notation on a white
list.

  Third, I am neither sufficiently smart or clever to know of a bullet-proof
way (sure fire or not) to tell if they're good lists. I'm also unqualified
to know how to determine bandwidth cost or ways of effectively caching
locally. I do run a local dns cache; I've not yet finished setting up the
tinydns server.

  About two years ago I had an interesting experience when e-mail from an
out-of-state trade association (of which I am a member) could not get e-mail
through to me. It was rejeted. I could find absolutely no rule in my UCE
checks that was triggered. I ran traceroute and found no blocked IP address
or domain name. However, when I placed that domain name (and that of their
upstream ISP) in header_checks with an "OK" action, the problem disappeared
and has not recurred. Shrug.

HTH,

Rich

  Well, thank you, Paul!

  I thought it was a good idea to have a separate /boot partition (although
I could not give you a good technical reason for that belief). Then, when I
tried to make such a partition on my Slackware boxes, I couldn't.

  Now I know why.

Absolutely.  I've been a TiVo user for over a year.  Recently upgraded
from 40G (40 hours at the low rez) to 120G (122 hours).  The week
that I didn't have TiVo (I broke the hard drive :) I kept muttering
"Must have my TiVo crack... must have my TiVo crack".

I pay $70-ish per month to Comcast for every movie channel out there,
but I draw the line at PPV (which seems a bit redundant :).  The TiVo
makes it all worth it too... I can grab two or three movies per night,
and three or four shows per day, and watch them in batches when I
return from my trips.

A separate boot partition can be small, which means it will boot with
old BIOSes.  One of the really cool things about Linux is that it
bypasses the BIOS for normal operation, so you can put a 120GB disk on
an ancient machine that only supports 1GB directly with the BIOS.  
This is true for GRUB at least, I assume LILO is as smart.

If you have a modern BIOS, or use a small disk, this is not an issue.
But I imagine RedHat got enough support calls that were "fixed" by 
using the separate partition that they made this a general recommendation.

I follow this recommendation when I put Linux and Win4Lin on old
Thinkpad 560 laptops; those only support 8GB disks natively, but will
happily talk to a 40GB or larger with Linux.  With Win98 running on top
of Win4Lin, you get a Windoze machine with more space, running faster
(ext2 is better than fat32), rapidly "rebootable", and back-uppable.

Subject: [PLUG] Radio Free Linux - a stand-alone Wifi linux download node
Message-ID: <20031004164318.GB15134@gate.kl-ic.com>

Help me construct a "canonical" linux distro iso image list (and perhaps
the best places to download them).  I have been thinking of getting
involved with the Personal Telco Wifi project.  However, my Comcast
Terms Of Service forbid me from rebroadcasting internet access, so I
cannot offer the usual kind of PTP site with www capability.

As a substitute, it would be fun to set up a stand-alone Wifi server
built around an old laptop running HostAP, with about a dozen distros
on it in iso image form, set up for downloads.  I was thinking maybe:

Redhat 8, Redhat 9, Fedora Core 1 ( "redhat 10" ), Suse 8, Suse 9,
Debian Woody, Debian Testing (sarge?), Knoppix 3.3, Slackware 9.1 .
Maybe also versions of FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD.    About 35GB
of stuff.

I do NOT want to upgrade frequently, but 4 or 5 major releases of new
distros per year should be manageable.  I want to only download iso's
with wget and check with md5sum, upgrade the index page, no more work
than that, hopefully semi-automated.  With the net connection normally
missing, and the download and executable partitions set to read-only,
this should be pretty easy to configure and tripwire and keep secure. 
No DNS or gateway or NAT or iptables or Xwindows to worry about.
I could keep the tripwire md5s on a write-protected floppy.

In fact, if I use 20 character random-string passwords, perhaps I can
make the entire machine world-readable, so it functions as a running
example.  Yes, the NSA could grab the password file and use an acre
of computers to crack it, but what would be the point?  J. Random
Script-Kiddie won't have the cycles.

I would probably set this up with an SSID of "linuxdownload".  I
see no need for authorization, just serve up a static index page
on port 80, and let the Wifi box provide dhcp service.  My TOS
would be pretty simple - "Be nice.  Turn off your engine.  Don't
leave trash.  Hack this server and I slash your tires".

It would be fun to meet the people parked out front, doing downloads.
Also fun to make complete drive images for folks wanting to replicate
the setup elsewhere.  We could put some of these in local libraries.
It would be a good way for some of you consulting types to *literally*
attract clients.  Heck, the neighborhood kids could set up a CDROM
stand out front during the summer.  Linux and lemonade ...

No, I don't need more features.  Any ideas that would make this even 
simpler?   Anybody want to help me locate and collect distro isos?

I think...

The BIOS has a 10 bit address space for the fixed disk cylinder number
which means it can only deal with cylinders below 1024.  The BIOS is used
at boot time to read the the MBR.  With a stock MBR, the active partition
and kernel need to be located below cylinder 1024 (todays drives have tens
of thousands of cylinders). 

If GRUB is installed to the MBR, this is not a problem.  Other
configurations require a boot partition below cylinder 1024.

Cheers,
Mike

That's why I bought a used, 2000 series ReplayTV. Even if the service (free for a 2000 series) goes away, I can still program it to manually record. It just won't have the features that require the tv schedule.

I've been playing with Gentoo a little lately, and they also talk about a /boot partition. The docs I am reading say it's not mounted when your system boots. Sounds like it might be a security measure, but I'm not sure of the ramifications. I haven't thought it through, so to speak...

I would get the "lifetime" service since this tends to actually increase
in value.  Should you ever want to upgrade your TiVo, the lifetime service
massively boosts your original unit's resale value.

I.e. I paid $250 for the lifetime service on my Series 1, but on Ebay
units with lifetime service sell for $300 more than units without it.

Of course all this assumes that you sell the TiVo instead of just using it
until it breaks.  I suspect I'll run mine until it can run no more, and
probably have a very, very sad day when it goes.

FWIW, recent versions (released in what - the last three years or so?)
of LILO also don't have the 1024 limit.

This limit really doesn't exist today with modern linux distros.

Many distros started using BitTorrent to distribute ISOs - I'd suggest

It might be nice to put a 'newbie-ized' distro up, too.... although I
don't know of any free ones off the top of my head.  Xandros, Lindows,
and Lycoris seem to be the popular ones, although none of them are free
- Lycoris seems to have a free download version, however.

I don't know about putting Debian on there - it, like gentoo, seems to
rely on you having a fast internet connection.  I'm sure (as with
Gentoo) there's a way around that, though.

All the reasons listed so far have been good ones-

Security - it ain't so easy to get in and see what's in /boot, letalone
write to it.
Safety - if you main filesystem is hosed, you might be able to still
boot, a little.  Of course, if your main filesystem is hosed, you have
bigger problems than losing your kernel.  ;-)

I keep my /boot partition seperate and unmounted because that makes it
more difficult to accidentally do damage when I'm playing kernel games.

  Yes, after the initial load is is much quicker. They've changed the UI,
however. Uglier fonts (IMO, of course) and checkbox widget buttons that are
grey/up instead of white/down. Little things like that which I'm sure that
I'll no longer notice in a few weeks. One function I finally learned how to
do correctly (if I haven't forgotten) is how to do a mail merge to envelopes
without having the text migrate up and to the left with succeeding
envelopes. _That_ was a major PITA when I did mailings.

  I avoid release candidates and betas for all applications I used in my
business. However, I was told that RC5 is the 1.1.0 release so I went ahead
and got it.

I can't speak for Debian packages, but none of the kernel rpms I've
ever seen make any effort to mount /boot before copying new images and
updating grub.conf.

On any given system, that's not such a big deal. You just mount /boot
before installing the package. On a larger network, however, it'd be
just that much more work -- mount /boot, do the upgrade, umount /boot.

I think I'd rather stick with a bootable CD recovery disk. :-)

You could just add the right incantation to /sbin/installkernel.

Me personally, I don't use a separate /boot partition.

I think that's only for the series 1 TiVos, nobody has found the special 
remote control dance to get 30 second skips on the series 2 yet I 
believe. :(

Yeah, the Home Media Option isn't the finest of options I've read - it 
takes many, many hours to move shows from TiVo to TiVo (even if you're 
on ethernet).  Having never used it I don't really know though, that 
might all be wrong - at 10Mb you should be able to watch an MPEG2 stream 
from your other TiVo directly I'd think though!  Most of my DVD's 
average 5-ish Mb/sec.

No, SPS30S works fine on series 2 systems.  I've got one.

If you're using hmo to watch shows on another tivo, speed depends on the 
compression level.  For recordings at the highest quality (thus largest 
size on disk), transfer is slightly less than real time.  Anything else 
is faster than real time.

hmo can also of course be used for other things (pick up mp3 files from 
your home system; pick up jpeg files; various internet streaming radio 
stations, etc.).

No, the general backdoor code is not known, but I have a series 2,
and the SPS30S code works just fine as a special code.

Subject: [PLUG] Why create a boot partition?
Message-ID: <200310042226.h94MQ3ws045322@m5p.com>

There is a bigger reason that hasn't been mentioned. LILO had a (very)
little bit of understanding of ext2. For a long while if you wanted to
use other filesystems for your root filesystem you needed a /boot which
was ext2 or minix to load the kernel. ReiserFS has fixed their
interactions now, but I don't know about other filesystems.

As to security and safety in case of crashes. Mounting your entire root
and /usr filesystems read-only is far more effective than merely having
/boot unmounted (though why not read-only, gives you similar advantages).
In case of a crash at a bad moment, you're going to need the tools that
are located on the root filesystem (notably fsck). If a cracker comes
they're probably going to be more interested in sticking trojans and
backdoors in /bin than in corrupting your kernel in /boot.

Subject: [PLUG] Comcast problems?
Message-ID: <200310041604.49299.kyle@silverbeach.net>

At the last PLUG meeting a couple of people mentioned Comcast DNS as being 
iffy.  I have Comcast as my ISP, but point my DNS elsewhere.  

The last few days, I've been noticing that the transfer rates are just fine, 
but getting connected to a web site takes up to a minute.  Things that I hit 
multiple times per day, like lwn.net, take a minute just to route.  I'm 
fairly sure it isn't DNS since I don't point to Comcast for DNS.  I've tried 
switching around the DNS server entries in /etc/resolv.conf just to see if 
that helps, and nothing changes the results.

Anyone have any idea what is happening with Comcast?

Also, traceroutes seem to be permanently disabled.  I can no longer traceroute 
to any site out of Comcast.  About five hops into Comcast's network, 
traceroute packets drop off the face of the earth.  Ping does work.

Best,
Kyle

Message-ID: <86wubkclz5.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I have been "off" of network file systems for a while, but after some
network reconfiguration I am reconsidering its efficacy for things
like home directories and shared source archive (tarballs) trees.
This is an all-linux network, pretty much, so I don't need to worry so
much about cross-platform compatibility.

What are people using these days?  Is it still NFS uber alles these
days or are there workable/preferable alternatives?  If NFS,
kernel-space or userland?  Thanks for pointers/recommendations.

The database only goes back to mid-March 2002 though.

Yeah, they seem to be doing something recently that breaks ICMP.  I do
*not* find this to be cool behaviour.  Would be nice if I could get
cable through @Home, who wouldn't have pulled such stunts.

Subject: [PLUG] Red Hat 8.0 weirdness.....
Message-ID: <3F801367.7060508@pobox.com>

I have been using Red Hat 7.3 on my development system for over a year. 
 It seems like Red Hat based a lot of stuff on 7.3 so maybe that was one 
of their really stable releases.  But I got a system to play around on 
and I had Red Hat 8.0 on some disks, so I installed it to check it out 
and let my housemates browse the web and use OpenOffice etc.  Anyway, 
8.0 seems to have some strange bugs.  One of them is when I use the 
shell terminal application, sometimes (for no apparent reason) the text 
I am typing jumps to beginning of the line and starts typing on top of 
the command prompt as if I inserted a CR with no LF.  So the commands I 
type are all broken up but when I hit enter the command executes exactly 
as I typed it, and backspace still works properly and everything.  Even 
though it is annoying, it seems to be harmless, but I still wonder what 
other kinds of problems are in there that I haven't discovered yet. 
 Does anyone know anything about RH8?  Should I download RH9 and try 
that instead?  I'm glad I didn't upgrade my development system.

Something else I noticed (albeit harmless) is that even when the RH8 
system is off, the light on my router is still on as if it is still 
connected.  But I guess that could be something to do with the ethernet 
card, I have no idea, but it seems like the machine would have to be 
stuck in some kind of dorment mode rather than being powered down in 
order for the ethernet card to be noticed by the router.  No idea, I'm 
just guessing.  But when my 7.3 system is powered down, the router does 
not show it connected.

Does anyone know anything else about RH8 that I should know about?

I haven't tried any of the NFS alternatives (Coda et al.) so I may not
be the best source of info -- but the kernel-space NFS stuff has
worked very well for me.

With its 8.0 and 9 releases, Red Hat started making a serious push
toward internationalization, trying to use unicode wherever it could.
Once casualty is xterms, which sometimes behave oddly -- though I've
never seen the symptoms you described.

I like 9 better than 8.0, mostly because the font support is superior
in 9. The main 'gotcha' is that the rpm binary doesn't work well with
non-Red Hat kernels. You've either got to a)  recompile rpm without
posix mutexes or b) use LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 in your shell
environment when you run rpm.

Other than that, Red Hat 9 has been stable for me.

This sounds familiar, think it was fixed in an update, but I can't prove it. 
  In any event you want to grab the updates and apply them as necessary.
http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/rh8-errata.html

Avoided RH 8.0 since it was so different in many ways than the 7 series.  In 
good ways no doubt, but had growing pains.  As Paul said, 9.0, might be more 
worthwhile.

Dunno why the network card would now be hibernating when it didn't before. 
Maybe "wake-on-lan" go turned on?  Wouldn't worry about it too much.

Yeah, but then you'd of been sold off to Comcast and stuck with it 
anyway.  I was one of those that was originally @home.  DSL is not 
option so...
Every so often I get wierd behaviour as well.  DNS not working or the 
web page loading delays as well.  But then, I think I'm in a luddite 
neighborhood.  I suspect the people across the street are the only 
others that use the net.

I'll have to second Paul's experience.  NFS has worked very well so I 
haven't explored the alternatives.

Brian,

You ethernet card is maintaining link to the router even when your
machine is off because of some power management settings.  You should be
able to set your machine's BIOS and/or the network card driver to one of
the following behaiviors:
1.	No Power Mangement / Don't maintain link on power off.
2.	Power Management / wake from power off on link change
3.	Power Management / wake from power off on any traffic directed
to NIC's mac address.

Some NIC / BIOS combinations allow for more options.  Some for slightly
less.  I've listed the most common.

The BIOS setting are fairly easy to find.  The NIC settings are entirely
different.  If you are using an Intel based NIC, you can use PROBOOT.EXE
to modify the NIC's settings, but I think you'd have to boot to DOS to
do it.  I'm unsure if intel drivers allow to modify these setting from
within Linux.

Hope that helps,
EcD.

Isn't a drive something that can be looked at as a series of writable
locations from 0 to some high number where some of these locations 
need to have partition start and partition end written to them?  Why 
won't Microsoft and everyone else agree that partitioning should be
defined outside any operating system where a recognized hardware API
could then be made to work for everyone wanting to access that drive?  
I would think this would solve a lot of problems with the OS not 
looking at the drive geometry correctly. 
 
What does partition alignment really mean?  Is it like memory 
alignment where you use packing of nibbles to create bytes 
because the architecture has a certain word size or something?  
If these counters were part of the drive controller would we 
ever have had the 10 bit counter limit or 1024 cylinders?
I guess this as a red herring though like the making
everyone implement PTR records in their dns.

It's a shame you can't treat an eighty gig drive as two seperate
drives accessed as drive one and drive two.  This would allow
partitioning in one way on one half and a different way on the
other half addressing the issue of Windoze or dos wants the
drive to be set up differently quite nicely.

An annoyance regarding PC's is that there are assumptions built
into them about drives and such that just seem to needlessly 
lead to trouble.

Michael, if all the different companies could agree on one standard for 
everything, it would all be so much more simple.  But then again, there 
would be less incentive for people to try to come up with alternate 
solutions to old problems.  There is a lot of information about 
partitioning and how it all works, and the different kinds of partitions 
on the Internet (too much for me to list here).  Most operating systems 
are designed to use their own proprietary partitions, but many of them 
recognize others as well.  As far as I know, most distributions of Linux 
recognize up to 100 different types of partitions.

You can have two different partitions types on one drive.  I have a 
dual-boot system (I am using it right now) that has Linux with a big 
ext3 partition and the other boot option is Windows XP Pro (with NTFS) 
that I use for testing Java code on Windows and a few other things for 
which there is not comparable software available for Linux yet.  So I 
created a special partition of type vfat that I use to store files that 
I need to read from both operating systems because they both recognize 
vfat.  That way, no matter which boot option I choose, I have access to 
those files.  I think having a lot of different types of partitions is 
very beneficial.

I don't think it's a matter of one standard, it's a matter of being able
to simply tell where the partitions are from within any environment.
I'm not interested in the physical partitions so much themselves as
the alignment issues that come up trying to mix types and trying to
use XOSL for example.

I guess the only solution for those who want to be especially safe is
one operating system per hard drive.
 
One problem with information is getting the information that fits
the situation you're in.  So much patching for so long suggests
understanding how hard drives work in PC's today is hardly worth
it over developing a replacement standard.  Though that's happening
it looks like with serial ATA.

You may be confusing partition types and file systems
depending on what you mean by "recognize". Linux can
mount numerous file systems but nothing close to 100.
Perhaps you're thinking of the long list of partition
types you see when you use the fdisk program. You can
create a partition using fdisk and set it's type to
any of the 200 or so possible values but that does not
mean that Linux will be able to use the file system
normally associated with that partition type.

That's roughly the way it works now.

It already is. It's not the operating systems that impose the
1024 cylinder limit that's been discussed in this thread.

Didn't we cover this in one of the Linux classes that you
attended?  :-)

PC partition tables specify the start and end of partitions
in two ways:

1. the legacy heads/sectors/tracks method that is geometry
   specific.

2. using sector numbering that is independent of drive geometry.

Two completely different things. When IBM designed the PC BIOS
they thought that the product would have a short lifetime. They
had no idea that it would be with us decades later. They
designed the BIOS for hard disks of the day, where a 10-bit
cylinder count was reasonable.

When technology moved past that, we should have replaced PC
architecture with something better. We didn't. Whose fault
is that?

Why two? Why not 4, 8, 16, 32, etc?

You can treat it as separate drives. That's what partitions do.

There is a standard on PCs for partitioning drives.  It has some 
restrictions, like 4 primary partitions, and cylinder alignment, but is 
used by most PC operating systems.  Other platforms and some OSes like 
the BSDs have other schemes.

There are also two BIOS hardware APIs to access the hard drive.  One is 
the old CHS method that uses the drive geometry.  This is the one with 
the 1024 cylinder limit and 8 GB drive size.  DOS and Windows 95/98 are 
limited by this because they are old.  The other is the LBA method that 
Linux and Windows 2000 uses.  The BIOS does not care one bit about 
partitioning.

Partition alignment means that the partitions are aligned to cylinder 
boundaries.  The old disk access mode used the disk geometry of 
cylinder, head, and sector (CHS) to address sectors.  For the most part, 
the partitions needed to start on cylinder boundaries.  The CHS access 
mode went all the way to the drive controller.

All modern hard drives and BIOS support the linear block access (LBA) 
mode which treats the drive as a linear sequence of sectors.  The drive 
hides its real geometry.  The partition table also stores the begin, 
end, and size in sectors.  It is usually a good idea to keep the 
partitions aligned with cylinders so older programs (like Windows) don't 
get confused.

I'm suggesting equivalent to plugging one of two 40's in as opposed to
one 80 gig drive under fdisk.  If you unplug one and it has something 
on it you protect that something.  Yes you can partition the 80 but 
you see all the partitions and as far as I know you can't delete the
first partition and redo it without dumping everything.  It can be hard
to tell which partitions you want seeing all of them from all of
your systems at once.  One change I'd like to see is allowing
the primary partitions to each have their own extended chain so that
it's easier under Ranish and other tools to tell what goes to what.  
Maybe a primary partition should optionally be settable as a drive
with a certain percentage of the real drive's total disk space.  
That would allow one drive to pretend to be four: hda, hdb. hdc, 
and hdd perhaps.  Now performance would be fine if each simulated
drive represented a different OS where you boot one at a time.
However, performance would not be good if you need to use
hda and any of hdb, hdc, and hdd at the same time because these
are just on one drive with one data connection that is
shared.

By having a drive act as two hard drives plugged into the same cable 
I mean that literally where you would indicate in a bios program what
part of the drive is drive 0 and what part is drive 1 you fool
Linux fdisk and other tools purposely that one drive is two 
physical drives: hda and hdb say.  The only way to get that is to buy
two hard drives where half of one will easily host an OS for me.

In Von Neumann arhitecture, instructions and data flow in together
and there's a bottleneck as far as I/O, if I remember right.
If the CHS bios had simply been upgraded to work in say 20 bits
or another multiple of 10 bits I would think a CHS scheme could
be extended to today's drives while being downward compatible
without the patches we've accumulated from translation schemes.  
A software solution means running a program on the cpu.  Isn't 
IO slow enough on PC's?  The processors are at 2 plus gigaherz, 
but the drives can't catch up.

In the rare occasion I have worked with a sub 500 meg drive, it is
so nice to not have to worry about bios issues.  Sometimes I think
hard drive technology on the PC is so preposterous that had I the
factory and the engineering nohow I'd consider building a new type
of controller and drive and release the source code to 
drivers that would make the combo work under Linux.  Microsoft 
probably wouldn't port it to Windows, but oh well.  Imagine 1 
terabyte addressing in hardware hard drives that are Linux 
compatible and between scsi and ata or at the cost of ata drives.  
To make these drives boot fast one could replace the first 100 
megs or so with nonvolatile high speed ram.

It would be nice if you pay about the same as you do for an 80 gig
drive for four twenty gig models new but that's not available as
far I know.  I'd rather have four smaller drives than one big one.

You'd think that would be the other ways around, i.e. traceroute works

Okay, so I create a windows fat32 in the first 10 gigs of my drive say
and I have 70 gigs left that I want to give Linux.  When I go to
partition, say I use fdisk, I get this warning that the partition is
not on the cylinder boundary.  Should I have created the partition
with Linux fdisk, tagged it FAT32, and then formatted it under dos?
Can I fix the boundary under Linux fdisk and line it up properly?
Strangely enough, Windows 98 misaligns the boundary and I've found
that xosl does so as well.

 All modern hard drives and BIOS support the linear block access (LBA) 
 mode which treats the drive as a linear sequence of sectors.  The drive 
 hides its real geometry.  The partition table also stores the begin, 
 end, and size in sectors.  It is usually a good idea to keep the 
 partitions aligned with cylinders so older programs (like Windows) don't 
 get confused.
 
Now I don't know why but if partition hiding is turned on for your Linux
boot under xosl you can't see your partitions under Linux fdisk.  It
doesn't seem possible to get XOSL completely off of a drive under
Linux unless dd'ing the boot sector with /dev/zero is the trick I'm
needing.  I've had trouble getting xosl completely off of a hard 
drive accidentally dumping a whole server once when I choose
the wrong drive under ranish thinking xosl could be used to 
erase xosl.  Guess I should have tried tom's root boot's dd
command.

I like xosl because ranish has a copy partition option that I use
on a Windows system.  I figure set it up, mirror it, then when
I have to set it up again I can just copy the mirror.

Now strangely enough, I have gotten Linux onto a system running xosl,
but for whatever reason the program upsets disk druid so I have to
create the Linux partitions under Ranish partition manager.  Maybe
the better approach over xosl is a program to mirror my partition 
to a network data vault, but I wonder what options I have to 
implement that.  I'm thinking this would be better in that strange
partitioning methods and boot manager software could be avoided.

Aside...

My original thinking with xosl is that I might want 98SE and
XP on the same drive not seeing each other and not in
the same partition.  Microsoft still it seems hasn't figured 
out that drive letters are a nightmere and that installing 
two versions of Windows to the same drive let alone one 
version ;-) is a bad idea.  Friends have told me not to
substitute XP for 98SE because it's slow so so far I
see no reason to get it.

Is samba working with XP yet?  Geez I hope I don't have to go
there.  At least I'd get the pro version looking into what
people have said about it.  I'd rather sink money into
pursuing my interests on a Linux or some other platform 
though.  Is there a word alternative to get Windows 
media file graphs, preferably available under Linux, 
out of science workshop into a printable document?  I have 
no choice about a course's Windows 98 software for running 
various sensors including sonic probes and sensor gates, 
etc.

What does a clicking disk drive tell you?  Experimenting
I discovered the disk was bad.  Are Mac high density
the same as PC high density disks?  I got a mac
disk to format in a PC so the first one I bought 
that day must have been bad.

... End aside

In the old days you could use Everex to low level format a hard
disk.  Anymore, there's no way to do that from a simple disk 
program.  Heck, there was a time when the bios could low level
format the hard drive.

Michael,

  Having just installed slack-9.0 on my new big box, the answer is "yes". I
used cfdisk (rather than plain fdisk), but it works the same way. I added
partitions as I wanted. All but two were type 83 (linux); one was the swap
(type 82) the other FAT16 (type 06).

  When I formatted the partitions, the dos partition was not presented. But,
when I was done, the installer recognized the dos partition, asked me if I
wanted it formatted, then did so.

While it is not clear to me what you are asking for, the LBA28 to
LBA48 transition seems to match your description.  LBA28 was restricted
to 2^28 sectors, 512 bytes each, or approx 137GB.  LBA48 will address
2^20th more sectors, or 144PB (P=Peta=1,000,000Giga).  I figure that
will last for the next decade or so, when it is replaced by some
other scheme.  

CHS died a deserved death, because modern drive platters store more
bytes on outer tracks than inner ones.  A sector based address is far
more universal than one that assumes a fixed physical architecture.
LBA48 will die when drives get smarter about managing their own data.

As far as why the cost of 80GB and 4x20GB are not the same, I suppose
it is the same principle that makes a 480 pound girlfriend different
from four 120 pound girlfriends.  Four small girlfriends are more fun,
but a lot harder to acquire (YMMV).   4 drives cost more than 1 because
it takes more effort to make them and sell them, given current technology.
Given October 2003 technology, you can get a 250GB drive for about the
same price ($208, pricewatch) as four 60GB drives ($52), but that is
because it is still somewhat difficult to build a 250GB, and the market
is still growing for drives that big.  A year from now, about the same
prices will purchase a 500GB drive or four 120GB drives.   The optimum
drive size in Oct 2003, in price per GB, is hovering around $102 for
160GB.

That said, I would be glad to sell you as many 80GB hard drives as
you want for $156, four times the current cost ($39) of a 20GB drive.

A different way to look at drive cost is that a 0GB drive costs $33 ,
and this doesn't change much over time for a given form factor.  Right
now, the cost of additional chunks of 20GB put into the drive go like
$6 for the first 20G, $7 for the next 20G, $8 for the next, etc.  The
curve isn't really straight like that, but it does fit within 10%.  This
time next year, the 0GB drive will still cost $33, and the additional
chunks will be 40GB instead of 20GB, at the same prices as above.

It's kinda scary.  If it keeps going at this rate, in about a decade
I will be able to digitize my waking life to hard disk, in stereo
video, for about 10 cents/day.  But an 80TB drive for $61 will still
cost less than four 20TB drives at $39 each.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0310051705130.13855@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I did not have the cable plugged in to the new box when I installed
Slackware-9.0 last evening, so I skipped setting up the network.

  Today I tried to get it up and running, but without success. I have copied
over all the correct content in /etc/host*. According to dmesg on the new
box, the NIC is recognized and loaded, but other modules are attempted with
failures due to resource conflicts.

  I cannot change the hostname (so it sticks after a reboot), and cannot
bring up the eth0 interface with ifconfig. I've followed the network
installation in the "book" on the Slackware site, but this time it's just
not working for me. Each of the other two times I've installed slack it's
been on a portable and the network cable has been plugged into the pcmcia
NIC.

  After flailing around a while, I'd appreciate some guidance (off or on the
list) where to start looking.

TIA,

Have you run netconfig?  Assuming this is a PCI NIC, you should be able
to just manually edit /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 to match your setup.

What kind of a network card is it, though?  When you're doing everything
manually, are you able to properly load the right module, and then run
ifconfig, set up DNS, then set the default gateway?

AFAIK, editing /etc/hostname sets the hostname so it sticks after a
reboot, but I could be mistaken there.

I'm not able to tell for sure if the PCMCIA NIC is what we're talking
about in this case - if it is, edit /etc/pcmcia/network.opts to match
your setup and see if you have more luck that way.

We can get this thing solved, you might just need to flesh out the
problem a little bit more.  :-)

Message-ID: <20031005194449.2eeaa725.russj@dimstar.net>

OK, I've acquired a laptop. Actually, my girlfriend bought it for me, so I can't complain too much. :)

Of course, it came with XP Home Edition. My first action was to install Mandrake 9.1. I didn't even let it boot Windows the first time. :)

Anyway, the install went fine. Upon reboot at the end of the install, the system locks up when it tries to start pcmcia. OK... I do a little research and find out there are lots of people having difficulty with PCMCIA on the ZE4400 series... I guess it's been an issue for some time with the pavilion notebooks. 

To make a long story short, I finally got to the point where I can boot and use the system, but specifically specifying that pcmcia NOT run upon boot. Fortunately, the NIC isn't a card. So, I'm actually typing this message in sylpheed, running on my desktop, with the display on the laptop.. :)

The only bad part of this is that I'm still wired. I'd like to get a wireless card and hub so I can get rid of the ethernet cable I have strung across my living room. That'll require PCMCIA, unless there's another add-on for this thing that I haven't discovered yet.

So, now my question. Has anyone else here used one of these things, and if so, do you have pcmcia working?

I've searched the net, and found some help, but so far, no joy. The steps taken so far are:

1> Disable legacy USB support in BIOS.
2> Disable all known IRQs in /etc/pcmcia/config.opts.

According to the stuff I've found on the net, that's all folks have done. Unfortunately, the system still locks when I try to start pcmcia. (/etc/init.d/pcmcia start)

I can't find a debug switch for the pcmcia card services, and there's nothing in the logs at all. 

Any ideas anyone has will be gladly accepted. :)

The last sentence is ambiguous. I don't know what "dumping everything"
means. I think you may be saying that if you delete the first
partition, you'll lose data in the other partitions. This is not
normally the case. Disk partitioning programs, like fdisk, don't
allow you to redefine new partitions that overlap other partitions.

Note also that repartitioning a hard disk does not alter the
data on the partitions. You'd have to write to the disk with other
programs to modify the contents of the partitions.

I guess you want a comments field in the partition table.

There's nothing stopping us from doing this now as far as the
partition table is concerned. All we need is cooperation from
the computer's BIOS and boot loader programs.

But this is solving the wrong problem. Extended partitions are
a band-aid to the limitation of four primary partitions. The
better solution is to extend the number of primary partitions.

I am running RH7.3 and I am pretty sure that my cdrw drive is set up 
incorrectly.  I changed my grub.conf for scsi emulation which seems to 
work fine because cdrecord "looks" like it is writing to the cd.  But no 
data goes on to it.  I read somewhere that if you can mount your cdrw, 
then it should be set up correctly to write to it (I did not try to 
mount it before writing though).  But after testing that, I can not 
mount it and I think that is the problem.  fstab lists it as hdd, but my 
RedHat Hardware Browser lists it as hdc.  There is a link called 
/dev/cdrom1 that points to /dev/hdd, but as far as I can see my system 
does not have a /dev/hdd.  Anyway, I used ln to create a link called 
/dev/cdrw to point to /mnt/cdrw and I created /mnt/cdrw and deleted 
/mnt/cdrom1, which was there before.  I also edited fstab to reflect 
those changes, which I discovered since then is not the way to do it. 
 Then I restarted the system, and it restored everything to the way it 
was.  I used grep to try to find any files that contain 'hdd' or 
'cdrom1' but could not find any.  So I am at a loss as to how to let the 
system know that my cdrw is on /dev/hdc (which the Hardware Browser and 
some of my software packages already know), and change the link that 
points to it to 'cdrw' rather than 'cdrom1'.  I read a little bit about 
fsck and mkfs, but I am not really sure those are what I need to use 
either and I don't want to screw up anything really important in my file 
system.  Any advice?

Oops, I meant to say that I created a link from /dev/cdrw that points to 
/dev/hdc like it should, not /dev/hdd which has not device on it. 
 Anyway, I really just need to know why the Hardware Browser shows my 
cdrw as /dev/hdc but fstab shows it as /dev/cdrom1 which points to 
/dev/hdd.  Therein lies my problem and I can't edit fstab and I can't 
just create a new link either because it all gets reset again when I 
boot up.

It lists the correct cdrw as 0,0,0.  But when I run cdrecord with 
dev=0,0,0, it gives me the whole list of output like it is writing to 
the cd, and when it finally finishes, I mount the disk on my cdrom, 
which works fine, but there is no file system there, it even reports 
that there is no file system present when I mount the drive.

Mr CLISP wasn't paying attention in math class.

There shouldn't be any ands in there unless you're dealing with
decimals/fractions.

One hundred forty-four quadrillion, one hundred fifteen trillion, one
hundred eight-eight billion, seventy-five million, eight hundred fifty
thousand, eight hundred seventy-two.

Then if you have decimals, you'd add "and fifteen hundredths" to the end
of it.  :-)

When this has happened to me, it turned out that I had the drive set up as slave. It was the only drive on the chain, but because it was jumpered as slave, the system and linux both said it was the fourth drive. I had no second or third drive in the system. 

Another thing to keep in mind. Burning will happen on /dev/sgX, where X is the device on the "scsi" bus. 

Are you burning in "test" mode?

No, I'm not burning in test mode.  I originally had someone at a 
computer shop add the cdrom after the cdrw was already in there.  I know 
that /dev/cdrom pointed to /dev/scd0 before I started messing with it 
and /dev/cdrom1 pointed to /dev/hdd.  But my hardware browser always 
told me that the cdrom was scd0 and the cdrw was hdc, but I think it 
should be the other way around.  Does that seem right to you?  Shouldn't 
it be the other way around?

When I change grub.conf back to use hdd for scsi emulation and reboot, 
the hardware browser shows the cdrom as scd0 and the cdrw as hdc and 
cdrecord -scanbus reports the cdrom as 0,0,0 and does not report the 
cdrw.  When I change grub.conf to use hdc for scsi emulation, the 
hardware browser shows the cdrom as hdc and the cdrw as scd0 and 
cdrecord reports the cdrw as 0,0,0 and does not report the cdrom.  This 
is a dual boot system and when I boot into Windows both drives work fine 
and I can write cds on the cdrw.  Does that mean that the drives are set 
up as master and slave correctly or does it just mean that Windows uses 
some kind of voodoo to figure it all out?

The only way to know for sure is to look at the back of the drive and
verify the jumper settings.  The CS jumper setting can cause all kinds
of confusion.

I have things working.  It is hard to tell what is unconfigured on
Brian's machine, so I will tell how things are set up on mine.  There
are things about my setup I don't understand (hdd in some places, hdc
in others), and no doubt things that need fixing, but it works.

----------------------------------------------
On my machine, the cdr is on /dev/hdc.  In grub.conf, a typical section is:

   ...
   title Red Hat Linux (2.4.20-19.9)
           root (hd0,0)
           kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.20-19.9 ro root=/dev/hda1
           initrd /boot/initrd-2.4.20-19.9.img
           append="hdd=ide-scsi"
   ...

-----------------------------------------------
In /dev, I have a symbolic link:

lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            9 Aug  2 23:02 cdrom -> /dev/scd0

-----------------------------------------------
/etc/fstab contains the line:

  /dev/cdr       /mnt/cdrom              iso9660 noauto,owner,kudzu,ro 0 0

-----------------------------------------------
/etc/modules.conf contains:

   alias scd0 srmod
   alias scsi_hostadapter ide-scsi
   options ide-cd ignore=hdc dma=1

-----------------------------------------------
My redhat 9ish /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit contains, out of the box:

   ...
   # If they asked for ide-scsi, load it
   if LC_ALL=C grep -q "ide-scsi" /proc/cmdline ; then
        modprobe ide-cd >/dev/null 2>&1
        modprobe ide-scsi >/dev/null 2>&1
   fi

-----------------------------------------------
On earlier versions of redhat, I had this in /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

   /sbin/insmod ide-scsi

(it is now commented out)
-----------------------------------------------
When I do an lsmod, I see:

   ide-scsi      12176   0
   scsi_mod     107512   7  [sg sr_mod usb-storage ide-scsi aic7xxx sd_mod]

-----------------------------------------------
When I do a "cdrecord -scsibus", I see:

   Cdrecord 2.0 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 1995-2002 J?rg Schilling

The setup on my laptop is very similar (except I don't have the extra
peripherals, and "cdrecord -scanbus" doesn't show them).

Now, I can't say for sure what is causing problems for you, Brian, but 
perhaps a clue resides in the above observations.  Good luck!

----
BTW, for the rest of you, when I load a blank CDR media into my drive,
I get an empty automount window popping up with ///burn or something. 
Annoying.  Any way to kill that, without killing a normal automount?

Why then if CHS is deprecated because hard drive data 
density is greater on the outside tracks than inner 
ones do fdisk and disk druid check for CHS alignment?  
If CHS is based on equal density across a platter 
which is long gone than I would think that 
partitioning software shouldn't check CHS anymore.  
I've had anaconda crash because of nonaligned 
partitioning schemes, but why?  I wondering if 
Ranish is deprecated by not showing everything 
in terms of sectors first to last instead of in 
terms of CHS.  The only other possibility is that 
I had partition hiding active but I wonder if 
that is something standard where Linux should 
be able to get around it.

As far as the jokes about Word, what part of I don't
have a choice here don't a number of people understand?  
The lab uses a certain program that outputs a Microsoft 
data file which as far as I know can only be opened by 
Word.  If your so smart, be my guest and replace the 
Windows science workshop made by Pasco porting all the 
probes etc.  While your at it, maintain the same feel 
so that the port doesn't introduce a learning curve. 
I have no need for smart aleck comments as they neither 
amuse me nor change the situation one bit.  I do think 
it's silly to do scientific work in Windows, especially
98 considering how frequently it crashes, but then 
it's not my call.

Back to the CHS, clearly you don't want one partition
to contain the sectors in another, but this whole be on 
a cylinder boundary concept makes no sense at all.  Why
would a software program ever be concerned about 
cylinder alignment?  Are there gaps between writable
spaces on a hard disk leading to the whole cylinders 
concept?  From what I've looked at it appears that a 
hard disk maps where writable media is by it's own 
internal standard.

It seems like a hard disk if it is set up in a CHS
will register as a CHS drive but how is this happening?
Is this OS dependent or is there something at the start
of the drive that records it is in CHS format?  And this
16383,16,63 patch, how exactly does that work?  Is xosl
not large drive or linear addressing compatible?  Why
does it try to create a zero length partition between
each partition or have I run into a problem with how
disk druid is reading the partition table?  Why with 
large drives sometimes is it impossible to get the 
last meg or so of the drive into a partition? Why
under disk druid do you often times not get the 
exact size partition you request?  What is the
the difference between fdisk and cfdisk?  If cfdisk
reads large disks correctly, why do the Redhat 
installers put you in disk druid or fdisk anyways?

If you can't tell what partitions are what, you basically have to
start over.  That's what I meant by dumped.  If xosl was installed but
the partition it was installed to is gone, that can be hairy too.

So the bios is totally bogus because actual sectors vary for each
track, go up to 400 and higher which bios can't represent, and
anymore the LBA trick of using all the fields to get a total
sector count doesn't even work because we have gone over 8.4 
gigs.  If the bios were upgraded to store the physical geometry
for each track you wouldn't need translation where once again you
could have a low formatter for your drive without having to take 
it back to the manufacturer.  I guess I don't understand if a drive
knows how it is set up internally why it won't take a command
along the lines of, "give yourself a low level format." The 
manufacturer could make the low level formatter available 
through the standard system bios which can be password 
protected.
  
I don't think it would cost much to put a rom on a hard disk 
that has the drive's low level formatting program.  This ZBR 
recording is neat, offsetting of tracks to avoid rotational 
misses is fascinating too.  There are a variable number of
cylinders in each track now and a greater number of sectors
than 63 per track.  It still looks like hard disks have fifteen
tracks though.  Is more than a 32 bit number needed to hold the 
geometry of a single track?  That would be what, 480 bits total?

Does your operating system do sector addressing?

This is a question that's best answered by the BIOS makers
and computer makers. I've often wondered why BIOS are so
restrictive. Most BIOS will only boot an operating system
from a primary partition but there's no difficult challenge
in booting from a logical drive in an extended partition. To
boot from a logical drive, the BIOS just needs to follow the
chain until it discovers where the logical drive starts. This
is no big deal considering that any disk partitioning program
can do it. 


> Does the bios just assume

The BIOS assumes that sector zero contains the boot loader and
partition table. This has nothing to do with the 1024-cylinder
limit. The limitation is caused by the partition table's cylinder
value being limited to 10 bits.

> Why was a limit of four primary partitions imposed?

Because:

1. At the time IBM created the BIOS, Winchester hard disk
drives were weighing in at 5, 10, and 12 megabytes of total
capacity. How many pieces would you want to chop a 10 MB
drive in to? IBM decided that four was enough. I probably
would have made the same decision because I never would have
thought that the design would still be in use over 20 years
later.

2. IBM put both the boot loader and the partition table into
the same 512-byte sector. There wasn't enough space for more
primary partitions. If it was me, I would have used one sector
for the boot loader and another for the partition table. That
would have allowed 16 (primary) partitions. There would have
been no need for the insanity of extended partitions.

Remember that hard disk technology in 1981 was very different
than today's technology. Back then, disk space was expensive.
Using 1 sector rather than 2 was not considered an irrational
design consideration.

You're asking questions about why computers manufactured today
have the same limitations as computers designed in 1981. In
addition to partition table limitations we also have a
limit on the number of video cards that can be supported.

It's because today's computers are the same basic design as
the 1981 computers. The PC design should have been retired
years ago. Instead, it's kept alive by, well, inertia I guess.

Imagine if today's space probes used the same basic design as,
say, Voyager. Now imagine the PC.

That's a bit dramatic. You'd start over rather than mounting
the partition to see what was in it? Chances are that if you
looked at a partition's contents your memory would do the
rest. 

You can always run the fdisk program to see the partition
types. It's easy to see the difference between FAT16, FAT32,
NTFS, ext(2/3), Linux swap, LVM, etc. 

As I mentioned earlier, a comments field in the partition
table would do the job but we don't have that.

Perhaps anytime you create a partition and place a file
system on it, you create a text file in the root called
.whatami that describes the partition's purpose.

It's bad news if _anything_ is installed in a partition that is gone.

Because I'm not supreme dictator of the world yet.  You should

that doesn't comply with my standards.

By the way, I found the answer to that question in 1 minute with

Probably.  I don't remember.  I stopped caring about that stuff
years ago.  It's all going to be different in a few years anyway.

Rob,

  No, I had not. That's the tool I didn't run during installation and I
didn't know what it was called. Now I do, thank you.

  Just went through the process. But, when netconfig probed for the NIC it
couldn't find one. Strange. It's a run-of-the-mill NetGear card.

  Reading dmesg I see:
eepro100.c \\ reference to Don Becker
eepro100.c \\ referfence to modifier
Intel(R) PRO/1000 Netword Driver - version 4.4.12-k1
epic100.c  \\ ditto above
ne2k-pci.c
  ...
  A bunch of drivers apparently loaded and waiting. Then this:
eth0: depca_probe() cannot find device at 0x0200.
ibmtr: register_trdev() returned non-zero.

  Then a half-dozen lines probing for a 3c503.c-enabled card. Anyway, it
tries just about everything and finds no card.

  According to the ENU receipt, it's a NetGear 10/100 NIC. I don't recall
the model number but the tulip driver was tried by the kernel and didn't
find an appropriate chip set.

  No, no pcmcia slots on this workstation.

Actually, I'm really waiting for a stable NFSv4 implementation so that
I can move away from

* unencrypted communications

I have both. Card services is installed, and the kernel has them enabled, and the module is installed.

Subject: [PLUG] swap space on separate physical drive?
Message-ID: <3F819952.3090503@pobox.com>

I am reinstalling Linux on a machine that has a 120G and a little 3G 
drive.  I was trying to figure out what to do with the 3G drive and I 
thought I could use it as a really big amount of swap space.  I have 
heard that the swap space should be twice the amount of memory, and I 
have 256M of memory.  So my questions are:

Would 3G of swap space be overkill or a waste of hard drive space for a 
system with 256K of memory?  Or might it actually be a great idea since 
I have the extra space?  Would having my swap space on a separate 
physical hard drive make the system run slower or faster, or make no 
significant difference at all?

What would be the pros and cons of using the separate 3G drive for 
/boot?  What about /var?

Any input is welcome.

Message-ID: <1065459271.1179.52.camel@rhws.theplatinumrule.com>

I've got a CD stuck in the my CD-ROM drive of my RH8 box right now.

It's apparently a bad burn. I cannot unmount it as root, it's busy. I
can't eject it, the utility does not return. I've tried forcing it both
with software and with a paper clip. 

The light flashes intermittently, and I hear it clunking like it's
continually reinitializing, but no ejection. 

I'm using the system for other stuff, and can't reboot.

What do I do?

Yes, that much swap (if you ever start to use it) would be detrimental
to system performance.  With more than 512 Megs, the system can
potentially spend too much of its time swapping, instead of running.

This depends on the other hardware you have hooked up.  If you have a
somewhat modern motherboard, then the 3G drive will probably not run at
the full speed the controller is capable of running.  If you are going
to have to share an IDE controller with the something else and the 3G
drive, then the drive itself will slow down your system (IDE controllers
run at the speed of the slowest device on the bus; even when accessing
the fast device).  Even on its own controller, it may still slow down
your system, just because it is an old, slow drive.

If you are doing a complex boot scheme, you have a pro.  The performance
issue is what really matters.  I think that you will be much happier
without the 3G slug. Save it for a test box, or a fancy router, or a
fancy paper weight.

This is a metaquestion about the plug digest mailing system.

I sent out a response to Brian's cdrw question, and included some
config file fragments.   What came back in digest form was loaded
with "control-escaped" characters, which screws up the examples,
at least if you read mail with an ASCII mail reader.  For example,
double quotes (") and equal sign (=) are getting turned into
equal-22 (=22) and and equal-3D (=3D).  If a newbie tried using
those configs as the mailer munged them, chaos would result.  This
nonsense is going into the html archives, so we are capturing the
screwed-up examples forever.

I can bounce mail off other mail reflectors and I don't see
this;  the problem is specific either to plug's mail server or
the digesting system.  Folks that get un-digested mail may see
the characters un-munged, I can't tell.

Is anybody else seeing this?  Am I plug-incompatable?  Is
this ancient news, and I'm cluelessly restarting an old
argument?  Please respond directly to me at keithl at ieee.org
to save wear and tear on the list.  I will summarize and
post the results.

*** Please include this line:  (=) equals   (") doublequote

Whatever the source, we do post config files, so whatever
software is munging characters should be re-configured or
replaced, IMNSHO.  Hmph!

If you were using cdrdao (or a frontend for it) try:

	cdrdao unlock --device 2,0,0

where the '--device 2,0,0' matches your system. You can use 

	cdrdao scanbus 

to find out what device your cd writer is. All commands should be run as root.

I've since given up and stopped all other activities and rebooted,

Ok, we're looking at a kernel issue, then.

We need drivers for the network card.

For that, we need to know exactly what kind of card it is...  :-)

Do a 'cat /proc/pci' and see if anything in there sticks out as being
your network card, then we can google for that and hopefully find you a
driver.

The way most (all?) network card autoprobe scripts work is they just try
and load all the network card modules, one at a time, until one sticks
and says "I can run a network card installed in this machine!" and that
one is kept.

That's why you're seeing a plethora of modules go zooming by in dmesg. 
That's normal, unless the card gets hit by the first module, anyway.

I've been working at Vernier for 2 1/2 years, and it is a very pleasant

Rob,

  Er, ... I think I'm looking at a dead NIC; too long since I bought it for
a warranty replacment, unfortunately.

  /proc/pci shows host bridge, pci bridge, multimedia audio controller
(yes, finally broke down and bought an audio card since my new Hyundai LCD
monitor has built-in speakers), USB contrllers, ISA bridge, IDE interface
and the video card. No NIC. Sigh.

  Well, I guess I'll go buy a replacement at ENU this afternoon. I'll call
first and see if it's under warranty. Stay tuned for details at 11. :-)

Thanks,

Rich

ISTR that Karl had set up some kind of indexing utility on Drizzle.
(I was reminded of this by the string ``lurker" in the above URL.) I
only used this tool a few times because I had so much trouble getting
it work at the time in Mozilla: javascript would not function, links
would not work, etc. And it worked even less well in IE.

I tried it right after Russell posted the link, & it blew up my
copy of Mozilla. Could a group of volunteers try that link, use it
to research some topics, & see if it generally works for everyone

I suggest you get two mobile-dock drive tray systems, put both
drives in trays, and normally use only the 120G.  Copy the critical
portions of the 120G to the 3G, (hence the second slot) and keep the
3G on a shelf somewhere.  3G is plenty for a "recovery" system if
you leave out most of /home and /opt .   Make sure it is bootable.

Now, when something nasty happens, you can try booting off the 3G
with the 120G mounted but not critically active.  You can do some
of the same things with a Knoppix CD, but the 3G drive permits
you to customize and match your existing working system, and copy
files that may have gotten trashed on the 120G.   If something
goofs up your BIOS-CMOS settings, then the 3G may boot when the
120G does not.  It certainly makes rebuilding the 120G from backups
a whole lot easier.

Using the 3G to enhance performance probably isn't wise.   It
consumes more power, and is just another item that can fail or
hang.  While it might help to have /swap on a second spindle, a
big /swap is not advantageous, for reasons others have mentioned.

I was using NFS a couple of years ago.  It was usable but a bit flakey: 
sometimes the client couldn't remount after losing connection.  But I
looked into the alternatives, and none looked as promising.  Also, NFS
development, at least at that time, was very active, working out some
minor issues; so I'm guessing it's in good shape by now.

The NFS mailing list (nfs at lists.sourceforge.net) is quite active, with
patches flying left and right nearly every day. :-) The most
frequently mentioned bugfix issues these days concern a) diskless
clients and b) interoperability with other other operating systems.
The biggest development issue is NFSv4, and that's still in early
alpha stages.

In general, 2.4.2x offers reasonable NFS performance and stability
from both the server and client side. I don't think it's as good as
Solaris, but the margin is mighty narrow.

Message-ID: <1065473295.6615.28.camel@localhost>

Fellows and fellas,

I have just installed gentoo on my new Dell Inspiron, and I have two
simple questions:

First, the gentoo installation doc' says to compile the kernel like
this:

  make dep && make clean bzImage modules modules_install

But for some reason, if I modify the config and then run that command,
nothing changes.  E.g., I set all the PPP_* flags to "y" in the config,
recompiled, etc., but still couldn't use ppp.  Then I ran 'make
menuconfig' (which apparently doesn't read that file) and turned ppp on
that way, and it worked.  What do I need to do after tweaking the config
file?

Second, the touchpad on my Dell has no middle button, which I'm used to
using for copy/paste operations.  Is there a way to paste text without
that button?

Thanks,

Their DNS has been really bad lately.  I finally threw in the towel and
installed the "caching-nameserver" RPM, started up named, changed my
resolv.conf to 127.0.0.1 and moved on.  Those web pages sure are a lot
snappier now!

Sad, since the advantage of a shared DNS is that other peoples' lookups
get cached so you don't have to repeat them yourself.  What does it say
about Comcast's DNS that a local DNS that has to do each lookup all the
way from the root servers is faster?

If you change a configuration, do

  make oldconfig && make dep && make clean bzImage modules modules_install

Just check which file was modified by 'make menuconfig'.  The time stamp
should give it away.

Middle button emulation is to press both the left and the right buttons
at the same time, your X-server may need to have this feature turned on.

Would a better combination be utilizing 'forward first' in your
named.conf - or would that always wait for a reply from the forwarders
before talking to the root dns servers?

If that caused named to query the forwarders and a root server
simultaneously then provide the first response to come back, I think
that would be an ideal solution.  Anybody know how this works in
practice?

In my experience the 2.4.x kernels manage swap very poorly.  In
particular, they seem overly willing to swap things out just since they
haven't been used in a while-- even if there is plenty of memory
available.

All of my desktop/workstation systems with 256MB or above have zero swap.
Servers will get 1x memory up to 512MB since poor interactive performance
on seldom-user applications is less of an issue on them.  (I.e. on remote
servers having your fourth X desktop pane repaint slowly since it was
swapped out a half hour ago isn't an issue...)

Supposedly, 2.6 will be better on this, but for now commenting out all
swap from /etc/fstab and running "swapoff" has helped my workstation
performance a great deal.

A 3GB /var, or /tmp would be handy-- or you could create a 3GB /home/<you>
on the main drive and software mirror it to limit your losses in the event
the hard drive dies.

Thanks, Paul.  I was thinking oldconfig was just for upgrading to newer
kernels, because of the way it asks questions about new options, etc. 
But I prefer to tweak that config, just 'cause that's more linux-like
than the menu interface.

I've found DLT to be in general one of the most reliable tape formats I've
used.  In particular, the tapes seem to go bad in storage far less
frequently than 4mm (DDS), 8mm, or AIT have.  (Though for true archival
data, I'd suggest that you use 2 copies onto optical media, even if it's a
couple stacks of CD-Rs.)

About the only trick with DLT is to be sure that you're streaming data to
the drive.  You want whatever is writing to send an uninterrupted stream
of data to the DLT since that keeps the tape off the heads.  If the stream
dries up, the DLT is forced to stop, back up to where it stopped writing,
and start over again.  This kills performance and wears out tapes/heads
much faster than normal.

Also, you'll want to clean the DLTs more regularly than you might be used
to with DDS.  Let your drive vendor be your source for the exact frequency
since they'll be the ones replacing a drive whose heads have been worn
down from overcleaning.  ;-)

If I were choosing a drive right now, I would go with DLT8000.  DLT7000s
are outdated at this point.  I have no experience with SDLT, so I can't
comment directly on them.

Here's a related question.  Compiling/installing the kernel with 'make
menuconfig' doesn't seem to update the config file.  So if I use
menuconfig, how do I form a new config file from the results?

Hmm.  It is working for me and my Mozilla v1.4.  

My biggest complaint is that when there are more than 20 hits, there
is no button to look at the next 20.  For example, a search for
"lurker" returns 0-20/~46.  I can't get to the remaining 26 messages
easily.

My second biggest complaint is that, at least as configured, it
obscures email addresses.  This makes it difficult to contact the
author offline, which, when dredging through old archives, is probably
the most likely way one would want to contact someone.

I already point my base DNS service to other DNS servers.  And, I run a 
caching server.  That's why I said I was fairly sure it wasn't DNS above.  
Direct timings on DNS show that it isn't too bad for me, but I'm not going 
through Comcast at all for it.

It is something else that is causing the problem.  I am still having it, but 
not as bad as before.

They do usually require a donation of $10 with a monitor, but since it works, 
I'm not sure what they'll do.  They've got other distros for sale in their 
shop, so I'd assume that Slackware would be a worthy addition.

The donation for monitors is due to the fact that they get a lot of dead ones 
and those cost about $9 to recycle, plus some money for transportation (the 
closest place that will fully recycle them is in Seattle).  I think they may 
actually lose money on the $10/monitor :-(

Best,
Kyle

I think you're okay, AMD switched to "performance ratings" instead of the 
traditional frequency.  See,

Last time I asked it was $15 or so and it didn't matter if it worked.  I 
guess people lie when they drop stuff off so they cover themselves.  That 
was too much for me at the time, so here they sit.  I'd like to make them go 
away to good homes but just can't swing the $60 disposal fee.

Actually, maybe you're not okay.  From the chart here,
http://www.3dvelocity.com/reviews/amd_athlon/xp2100_3.htm

the 1500+ operates at 1.33 GHz like Linux is reporting.  I'd think if yours 
really was a 2100+ it would report around 1.73GHz.

Any markings on the chip?

If it was 7 hours, then I'd say that your system thinks that it is in UTC/GMT, 
but the hour is really set to PDT timezone.

I always set the hardware clock to GMT, but then I don't dual boot anything 
other than other Linux distros.  If you have Windows dual booted, then you'll 
need to set the hardware clock to the local timezone I think.

I find that ntpdate is the perfect tool for getting the clock back in sync 
regardless of how whacked it is.  xntp will fail to sync if the local time is 
too far off of the reference time server.  ntpdate will sync the time back in 
one shot (but does not track it like xntp).

Try something like this (as root):

# export TZDIR=PST8PDT
# ntpdate bigben.cac.washington.edu
# hwclock --systohc

Replace bigben.cac.washington.edu with an appropriate open NTP server.  That 
one works for me, but I try not to hit it more than once a week.  The U of 
Washington provides that service freely and I don't want to abuse their 
generosity.

The first line is possibly necessary if you've got a bizarre timezone set, or 
it is really whacked.  My local configuration (SuSE) doesn't seem to have it 
set at all, so I'm not sure where it will be set, but this should set it 
sufficiently for glibc to figure out the time.

The last line, hwclock, is usually a good idea for PC hardware.  Often the 
hardware clock will continue to drift off into the weeds even though the 
system time is OK.  I have had the misfortune of having servers that drifted 
more than eight hours between reboots.  It screwed up database timestamps 
really well after reboot.  Since then, I always sync the hardware clock with 
the system time.  Note that the above will probably set the hardware clock to 
PST8PDT timezone.  You may need to add --utc to the hwclock command line in 
that case.

I am not a system admin, nor do I play one on TV.  YMMV.  Void where 
prohibited. Tested model price $23,596.

Best,
Kyle

Uh, that doesn't sound right.  The actual MHz might be measured, but the CPU 
model number definitely should not be.   It should say "AMD Athlon XP 2100+".

Where did you get this?

I'm trying to salvage some data off an old drive, so I hook it up as
HDC, secondary master on my IDE system. I check the boot order and it is
clearly set to HD0, the primary master. I set all boot devices to HD0,
just to be sure. (Options are 0, 1, 2, 3)

BIOS finds the extra drive as the secondary master, but for some strange
reason, my system boots to it. I tried another HDD with Linux on it,
same. I went into fdisk and removed the boot flag from the extra drive,
same. 

What's going on here?

One possibility is that the fsb bus speed is set wrong.  I've seen 
similar behavior to what you describe with Athlon XP's on motherboards 
with jumpers to set the fsb speed, and the jumpers were set to 100 
instead of 133.

Actually, the kernel knows a lot about the processor it's running on,
including often the specific model.

cat /proc/cpuinfo to see all the stuff it knows about it...

What I was trying to say is that the OS should be reading one of the special 
registers in the chip for the model number.  That should never be changable 
from any outside source.  It is part of the CPUID stuff.  Thus, if Rich is 
seeing his CPU reported as a slower model, he's got a slower model, not what 
he bought.

The actual MHz that the chip is currently running at might be measured in some 
manner via multipliers/BIOS etc.  That could be a range of valid frequencies.  
I.e. you could have an XP 2100+, but for some reason be clocking it at 
1.3GHz.  Should still work (if the multipliers and FSB speed work out).  But, 
when the model number is different...

Best,
Kyle

Kyle,

  Au contraire. The Web page confirmed what I knew when I researched which
processor to purchase: the model number is higher than the actual speed (in
GHz). However, having the kernel see the cpu as a 1500+ with a speed of 1.33
GHz does not jive with the review. That speed chip was the first in the XP
line; the one I paid for is supposed to be the latest -- almost -- in that
line.

  Tomorrow I call.

Thanks,

Yes, I misread what you were trying to say, I guess.

It does definitely look like he got a slower chip, unless the chip gives
a different ID when it is clocked lower... with their funky PR garbage.

Either way, it's not running at top speed, so if somebody assembled the
system, they need to fix it for you.

Kyle,

  If there's not a school or such that can use them, you can probably follow
my lead and donate it to Human Solutions. They serve very low income folks
here in east county. I've donated stuff to them for years (including
appliances) and the computer stuff I've given them they've used in their
office.

  I believe the new director there is the Rev. Ann Duffy. She's a fabulous
lady and a great leader for that organization.

I'm usually just lurking here, but when the discussion turns to Free Geek, I 
can contribute information and offer assistance.

If I had your word that those monitors are in working order, I could take 
them directly, test them, and put them into the system myself.  I could do 
this at no charge to you.  Normally the fee is $10 per monitor, by the way.

Just let me know when you want to bring them, and ask for me, so I can 
recieve them in directly.  Willing to go out of my way for LUSERS :-)

Rob,

  Only once since 1988 have I bought/used a system asssembled by someone
else. This was one I put together myself. And, I suspect that even if the
bus speed was set incorrectly, the CPU identification should be correct. It
ain't.

Thanks,

On my system the BIOS gives me FSB........

So on reboot I hit del and go to advanced.

And it is under a heading called

FSB Frequency.

This is dependent on Motherboard and BIOS manufacture

Marvin/Dave, et al.:

  I _really_ appreciate all that I learn from you folks! My system is a bit
different, but using the 'del' key (rather than 'esc') I got to the BIOS. I
looked at each category, but there was nothing about the FSB. Toward the
bottom of the right side was an item "Enable High Performance Features"; no
explanation. But I selected it anyway, saw a message that warned me enabling
whatever was going to be enabled might be dangerous and could have
catastrophic results and ... (gulp!) ... I pressed the [Enter] key. Saved
and exited.

  The system rebooted, I logged in a root and ran 'less /proc/cpuinfo'.
Ta-da! The cup is recognized as an Athlon 2100+, the speed is 1.86GHz and
there are about 3600 bogomips.

  Whew!

  This was a great lesson and I'm honored to learn from you.

Thanks,

Rich

PSU's 163 course.  I never used it for intensive mathematics 
which is what it was designed for.  It has sixteen math units 
on it.  Right now it runs Redhat 6.2.  It's a 366 mhz 21164A 
with 64 megs of ram.  It requires 72 pin parity simms so it's 
almost impossible to upgrade the memory.  That said, it works
beautifully.  It's had very light use.  One thought is to 
replace my 386 server with it so that I can do zebra where 
I'm wondering if I can mirror my robinson-west.com site to 
it along with my ftp site.  It has an old, probably ata-33 
controller, but it can take 64 bit pci cards so I'm wondering 
if there's a good scsi card I can get for it.  So far my 
policy has been identical Pentium III systems, D815EEA2's 
precisely, the 386 being the one exception.  My 386 is ultra 
standard AMD and it works so that's why I've been using 
it.  A 40 mhz 386 has a hard time generating 1024 bit keys 
though where I doubt I can run Linux 2.4 on it so that I 
can upgrade to iptables.  Don't know if debian would be
best choice to upgrade Redhat 6.2 axp where I want to
do dynamic routing with an existing RH 7.2 box as the
other gateway to the Internet.

The hard disk on my alpha is a bit small, I run 80 gigs on
my PIII gateway where the alpha only has a 2.5 gig drive.
Anyone know how to install a monster drive to a 21164A?

A booting, solid install. When I remove the secondary master, it boots as expected.

GRUB- on all drives

I'm going to try later and check the advanced booting options, had that thought just an hour ago.

On an Intel D815EEA2, a Pentium III system, there's an option to tell 
it which drive or device to boot from in whatever order you specify.
It may be that when the other drive is plugged it was always set as 
the primary boot device so it boots instead of the other drive that 
really should be booting instead.

Another possibility is second drive controller only one on or maybe
the original boot drive has failed so it is switching to the second.
Is the bios interpreting controller 1 and controller 2 as the same
ones you are?  Check boot device priority and where the bios thinks
drives are plugged in, on some systems these can be set differently.
Maybe they should do like the Alpha on the PC and move the bootloader
into firmware on the motherboard.  The other thing that seems to
cause this sometimes is connecting the cables in wrong.  It may
be a drive issue where some drives don't work correctly when plugged
in in certain positions on your controllers, though I'm not certain 
why.  One would hope at least this part of the ATA nightmere would
get fixed right.

I'm not totally sure how hardware works with processor architectures,
but the impression I've always had is as long as there are drivers for
the hardware that will compile under the architecture in question,
you're good to go... so, I *think* most SCSI cards should work for it.

On a 386, you pretty much want to avoid any kind of encryption... even
just ssh keys can take upwards of thirty seconds to authenticate with. 
They're great packet routers, though!  :-)

A 386 should be able to do iptables with 2.4.22 without too many
problems... it won't do too much more, but it does iptables nicely.

Unless the case is something funny, it should be as simple as adding a
drive to any other system.  Just plug 'er in.  Although, I could see
maybe if the BIOS is different or something with the Alpha hardware?  I
haven't had the pleasure to play with any non-x86 hardware yet.  I'm
keeping my eyes peeled for some old Sparc hardware or something,
though.  :-)

FWIW, if I were putting Linux on the sucker, I'd go with Gentoo.  I
don't like RedHat or Debian, and Slackware's alpha port slipped back
into non-existence several months ago.. which doesn't leave a lot of
options open.  It sure would be slow compiling on that sucker, though.

Crontabs are usually in /var/spool/cron/crontabs I think.  That's where
they are on all my systems, anyway.  :-)

It's a good idea to set up a second boot option in your
/boot/grub/grub.conf if you use grub or /etc/lilo.conf if
you use lilo for your new kernel in case it doesn't boot
so that you can get back up on your old one.  I wouldn't
overwrite the old kernel until you know the new one at 
least boots.

I may be sounding like a broken record here, but consider switching to
disk-to-disk backup.  Faster, cheaper, more reliable, more capacity,
less system load, easier swapping.  I can do full level-0 equivalents
on all the machines on my network (80GB worth) in 40 minutes, without
needing to bring anything down to single user.

I am working up a web page for drive-to-drive backups:

http://www.keithl.com/linuxbackup.html

I still need to write up the software I use for backups (dirvish) and
write up doing a bare-metal recovery with rsync.  I do have pointers
to the software, hotswap drive cages, and the like.  This approach will
get even cheaper and easier when Alan Cox finishes writing more IDE
hotswap drivers; for now I use a USB2 connected cage.  But it is 
already much cheaper and faster than tapes and a drive.

I have, on-line, two weeks worth of complete virtual backups, and
more on the swappable drive in the fireproof safe.  This setup is
REALLY COOL. 

I will have some Exabyte drives for sale (cheap) pretty soon now.

Just wanted you to elaborate on the symptoms.  What motherboard?  Are
there BIOS upgrades available for it?  What does:

  $ awk '{ print FILENAME ":",$0 }' `find /proc/ide -name model`

say under each scenario (with/without "wrong" drive installed)?  Does
BIOS agree with your understanding of which drive is where?

You might try intervening at the GRUB prompt and poking around to see
where grub thinks things might be.  Look at the various
/boot/grub/menu.lst's, /boot/grub/device.map's, etc.

Double check you jumpers, remember that WD drives have no jumper if they
are standalone, all others need a Master jumper.

What happens if you switch the drives, so that your old drive is in the
HD0 slot, and your good boot drive is in the HD2 slot?

If HD2 boots, and you have selected HD0 as the first boot device, then
I'd say you have a broken BIOS.

Another work around is to put the old drive in a box that boots to
CD-ROM, and use Knoppix (or other CD based OS) to copy data over the
network.

I guess Ranish partition manager uses a partition to run out
of that I can write to.  How hard would it be to modify the
program so that you can label every partition or in the case
of ext3 partitions see the partition labels?  I like the interface
for Ranish but I wish it partitioned the same way disk druid
does maintaining the copy partition to open space or another
adequately sized partition feature before an OS even has to
be booted up.

Good job.  I've been thinking about this too.  I figured I could unmount
a second forty gig drive I want to use for backup on one of my machines
and then unlock and remove it from it's tray.  The idea being to take it
out while the system is up, but this causes infinite drive activity. 
The latter can be done for floppy disks, why not hard disk drives?  The
only other approach I can think of is to take a dedicated computer
filling it with drives and substitute disconnecting the ethernet cable
for taking the drives out.  The latter may be better because it involves
avoiding the purchase of trays where I'm afraid I'll drop a hard drive,
something I have done in the past.  Tapes are more likely to work
after being dropped, though a system that does away with loading
altogether is very attractive.  For safety, the backup box filled
with drives can be placed in another room on a different circuit.  
I guess a simple light switch could be wired to a circuit that 
connects and disconnects the backup box from the network where 
putting it on a non externally routed ip subnet would make it 
even safer.  Closets would make good places for this box where 
it would make sense to have two in two different locations.

You don't need to bring anything down to single user to do tape
backups either, at least not the way I do them (tar).  Whatever you
lose doing "live" backups to tape, you also lose doing "live" backups
to disk.

There are still some advantages to tape, one being size.  The external
drives I just put together occupy about the same space as 32 4mm tape
cartridges.  At DDS3 densities, an 80gig disk in an enclosure loses by
a factor of nearly 5.  Tapes are easier to carry off-site.  Not sure
about your "less system load" or "easier swapping" claims either.
Color me sceptical.  _Less_ swapping, certainly.  But otherwise, I am
drifting inexorably towards disk backup too, mostly because practical
tape solutions are too expensive.  I am guessing that an IDE drive is
probably able to survive heat (e.g. from a fire) better than a tape
cartridge also.

BTW, Dirvish is using the same strategy that I invented independently
(and that probably existed long before I thought of it) two years ago:
basically, exploiting hardlinks to save disk space on unchanged
portions of snapshots.  Even before rsync got the explicit support for
doing this, you could fake it by first doing a tree copy using
hardlinks:

  cp -al <src> <dest>

where <src> was the last snapshot, and then rsyncing a new backup to
<dest>.  Since rsync 2.5.6, you can just use the --link-dest option to
do effectively the same thing in one shot.

The tricky thing about these is keeping people from changing anything
in the mounted snapshots.  Because they are hardlinks, a write to the
shared inode changes _all_ the snapshots.  Allowing the file system to
be accessible for reading/recovery and writable for making new
snapshots at the same time is a challenge.

It's a WD alright. I've tried all of the possibilities on the jumper,
and only tried the ones that correctly detect in the BIOS on bootup.

The drive is in a pluggable bay, hadn't tried that yet. I did switch the
BIOS to boot to HD2, and low and behold, the GRUB screen is different.
I'm getting the correct GRUB, from HD0, it's loading from HD2, though.

I may have to D/L Knoppix, it sounds like. I've wanted to play with it
anyway...

I'm in the process of converting a NT based mail server to a Linux based 
one.  A comma seperated file has been created with usernames and 
passwords.  I'm looking for a tool that can create users on the Linux 
host.  Initially I thought of an expect script, but I'm coming up short 
finding an example using google.  I'm wondering if anyone might have a

I'm no shell script expert, but here's a script that will read a text
file with "firstname lastname" and create users by their first name, 
with password of their first name. I'll bet someone can come up with
something better, but this might get you started:

  #!/bin/bash
  cat users | while read first last
  do
    useradd $first
    echo $last | passwd --stdin $first
  done

The text file is called "users" and could be something like this:

  fred flintstone
  barney rubble
  betty rubble

Hope this helps,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0310070730230.23009@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  What is the difference between invoking 'init' or 'telinit' to change
run levels? If I interpret the man page correctly, 'init' is used by the
system when starting while 'telinit' is the appropriate invocation to change
runlevels on a running system. Is that all the difference?

  With my Red Hat systems I would use -- when needed -- 'init N' to change
the run level to N. On my Slackware boxes the instructions are to use
'telinit N'. I'm trying to understand the subtle differences between the
two, if any.

I've had good luck running Debian "testing" on my old AlphaStation at
home. That'd be my first recommendation. There's a guy a Red Hat who's
working on an unofficial port of Red Hat 9 to the Alpha; he mentioned
on fedora-devel recently that it might be ready for testing in the
near future.

As far as adding a drive, any SCSI device with a similar pinout
to your current controller should work.

I've still got HP stuff set to run differential, one in an array...

http://theplatinumrule.com/9000parts

The HAAS array is near the bottom It's populated with 9.0 DFs. No
external cables, sorry.

There are 4? 2.0 DFs in another housing, too.

Looks like telinit is just a soft link to init.

On Redhat 7.3 does anyone have trouble in runlevel 5 using gnome with
the login screen getting trashed sometimes?  I do a ctrl-alt-backspace
and that always seems to clean it up, but I'm wondering where the
garbage is getting onto the screen from.  Another thing
I've run into using LTSP is that I see three entries under who or
:0, :0, and condor.robinson-west.come:0 simultaneously.  Shouldn't 
there be only one entry for :0?  Do I have crashed sessions?  How 
do I clean this up?

I uninstalled xsri because I don't want Redhat's default
background to override gnome's, then again xsri may be what cleaned
up the screen.

That sounds like a broken GRUB configuration.  I know that lilo will
search for other bootable devices if it can't find the default, maybe
you've had a broken configuration, but didn't notice because that was
the only bootable device; until now.

Wow, I didn't know --stdin existed.  Added between passwd ver 0.64 and

/etc/timezone says US/Pacific.  I have another machine that I
configured at the same time (also Knoppix).  The time was all
coordinated correctly on it.  But tzconfig told me I was in CET
timezone (whatever that is).  I changed it to Pacific and now it's
screwed up too.  At least it should be a clue.  The ntpdate tip sets
the time returned by "date" to the correct value, but the time in
/var/log/messages is still off.

How about a 14" Zenith 1440 or 1450? I've still got a few on special

I know a person that is running an DEC alpha box as his
primary home system on Linux.  I'll ask what distribution
he is using.  It might take a couple of days to get an answer.

Peculiarly enough, the Athlon XP will show a CPU identification not its
own when over or under clocked.  The popular overclocking of the Athlon
XP Barton core 2500+ chip to a 200 MHz FSB will result in a BIOS
responding Athlon 3200+ at a nice price savings.

Restarting the sysklogd service has corrected the log time stamp
discrepancy.  I also restartd cron and expect that to work too.
Thanks for all the ideas.   Hope this is the end of it.

That would be MET I think.

CET should be the former Eastern Bloc countries if I remember correctly.

Bulgaria isn't a bad guess.  I think they are on CET (CDT/CST probably).

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0310071445120.20794@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Reconfiguring the BIOS to "high performance" let the kernel see the Athlon
2100+ for what it is (but at 1.77GHz rather than the 1.83GHz it's supposed
to be), but now I have other problems.

  The network does not come up after booting. There have been two kernel
panics (a new experience here), and now when I try to invoke, 'ifconfig eth0
up' I see:
kernel BUG at page_alloc.c:100!]
invalid operand: 0000
<info on the cpu and registers>
eth0: unknown interface: No such device.

  This is with the 2.4.22 kernel that was put into place when I upgraded
yesterday from Slackware-9.0 to -9.1.

  So, I suppose that a kernel rebuild is the first order of business.
However, if any of you have other insights or suggestions for me, please
pass them on.

Thanks,

Rich

This doesn't smell like a kernel problem to me -- more like a hardware
issue related to the reconfigured BIOS. My hunches include, in no
particular order,

* overstressing memory
  - marginal RAM
  - RAM that's not rated for the higher bus speed
* overheating the CPU
* overheating something else on the motherboard

The overheating theory can be tested by turning the machine off for
long enough that its components settle to room temperature. Do
something stressful like a kernel build (my hunch is it'll succeed).
Let the machine heat up for an hour or so in regular use. Repeat the
stress test (my hunch is it'll fail).

My guess is your BIOS is now over-optimized for your hardware.  I would
return to the old settings and see if you can identify the particular BIOS
setting that allows the Athlon to run at full speed.  The "high
performance" preconfigured set probably made some unintended changes that
are incompatible with your hardware.

Rich,
	In my experience the high performance options usually result in an unstable machine. They tend to overclock the system some and cause all kinds of issues. What you really need to do is to find the correct settings in your BIOS for you MB/CPU. So what Mainboard are you using? Given that somebody should be able to tell you what switch to poke.

Garl,

  It's an MSI Socket-A VIA chipset KT333 with audio KT3 Ultra2. That's what
it says on the receipt.

  Supposedly, the folks at ENU sold me components that worked together. The
RAM is DDR 512M 333MHz PC2700.

  When I looked at the BIOS settings last evening (in reply to Paul's
comments), I found a section that reported CPU and ambient temperatures.
Both seemed reasonable to me. I wish there was a way to display those
temperatures on the console. (X not being run since I need to get another
mouse for this box; the Fellowes "Micro Trac" finger trackball locks the
machine.)

Subject: [PLUG] Mozilla not finding domains
Message-ID: <1065567829.14932.28.camel@kat>

A new behavior in mozilla is getting real annoying:

It stops being able to resolve domains.

It can find any domain it has already opened.

Now, I often leave mozilla open for *weeks* so this is real f'ing
annoying.

When I close mozilla I have to HUP a hanging process.

I am running:
        rpm -qa | grep mozi
        mozilla-mail-1.4-0.ximian.6.4
        mozilla-nss-1.4-0.ximian.6.4
        mozilla-chat-1.4-0.ximian.6.4
        mozilla-nspr-1.4-0.ximian.6.4
        mozilla-psm-1.4-0.ximian.6.4
        mozilla-js-debugger-1.4-0.ximian.6.4
        mozilla-1.4-0.ximian.6.4


Also I have multizilla and mozex in there.

for plugins I have 

        ls /usr/lib/mozilla-1.4/plugins/
        flashplayer.xpt  libflashplayer.so  libjavaplugin_oji.so  libnullplugin.so
        libjavaplugin_oji.so -> /usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_01/jre/plugin/i386/ns610-gcc32/libjavaplugin_oji.so
        
        ps alx | grep moz
        0   500 10240     1  15   0 186020 72644 schedu S  ?          7:02 /usr/lib/mozilla-1.4/mozilla-bin -UILocale en-US
        ps alx | grep 10240
        0   500 10240     1  15   0 186020 72624 schedu S  ?          7:02 /usr/lib/mozilla-1.4/mozilla-bin -UILocale en-US
        0   500  5000 10240  22   0 243152 1232 schedu S   ?          0:04 java_vm 


Nothing has changed in those files too recently.  It *might* be java
related, but that is iffy.

I am running djbdns on the workstation.

Ethereal show no packets going out when I type domain names into
mozilla.

Any ideas of where to look?

Rich,
	Under the Frequency/Voltage Control page in your BIOS, what do you currently have set? Specifically what is the FSB set to?

  More info: by default the MB is set to a clock speed of 133MHz. I did not
change this during assembly.

The trays ($12 @ Fry's) have handles - makes them harder to drop.  
Someday I'll make a padded foam storage box for a bunch of trays.
But the trays don't even have to be moved.  With the USB2 cage
(and probably with the Alan Cox IDE hotswap) you simply turn off the
cage power, and the drive is pretty much inert in place.  I change
the drive out with the drives in the fireproof safe for the very
slight possibility that the backup server gets stolen - and just in
case the current drive fails, so I don't lose as many days of backup.

Michael C. Robinson writes:
> ... For safety, the backup box filled

Another good idea.  I am moving more activity to laptops, so data from
the laptop and the backup server are almost always in two different
locations.  Right now, the backup server is also the mail server, so
I don't have separation, but I can probably rsync the mail between
mail server and laptop, and keep that data in two places, too.

The hard link through multiple copies means that one drive is doing the
job of many, many tapes.  Tapes don't support this random-access 
directory-based structure.  So indeed, you can hold a tape in your hand
with one 80GB backup on it (and that tape will cost about as much as
a hard disk these days),  but no tape can have the virtual equivalent
of 100 backups.  

The reason we even bother with backups at all is for later restoration
after a small or large disaster.  Single files come off a hard drive in
seconds; most of the time is spent physically getting the drive inserted
and the partition mounted.  Pulling a single file off a tape is very
slow - especially if you don't know for sure what tape it is on!  Bare
metal restores take a while for either process, but by putting a boot
partition on the backup drive, I can boot it with all the necessary
recovery information in place.  A configured CDROM might be as fast
as a disk partition, but it takes a while to build a CDROM, or plug
the right info into Linux-BBC or Knoppix. 

Russell Senior writes:
> ...  Not sure

I don't think you can rsync to a tape.  Rsync is very smart about
moving data;  thus, I back up 50GB of networked systems in 30 minutes
or so, with rsync throttled so it leaves bandwidth for other tasks.
Swapping?  Sure, it takes about as much time to move a hard drive
to storage as to move a box of tapes.  But it is easier to look
through multiple virtual images on a hard drive than load and unload
helical scan tapes.  As above, finding files is MUCH faster.




Russell Senior writes:

The backups are accessed through a few levels of directories with
permission 700, and the backup drive itself is normally unmounted.
If I get root-cracked, that doesn't stop someone from diddling the
backup drive, of course.  Or a loaded tape ...

If I was paranoid, I could power off the backup drive between uses. 
One method might put an old appliance timer on the power feed to the
backup hard disk - if backups normally run at 3am and take 40 minutes,
then the timer is set to power on at 2:50am and power off at 5:50am
(an hour of slop to allow for daylight savings time, and lazy clock
setting).  At the same time, the timer could oppositely power cycle
the cable router, so the backup drive is never connected to the net.
But frankly, I am not that paranoid.  I am more worried that someone
will social-engineer my wife into allowing physical access so they
can steal a backup drive. So maybe it is good that hard drive trays
are bigger than tapes.  :-)
 
---

This is all very much a work in progress.  As a pioneer in this
one small way,  I expect a few arrow wounds,  but the feedback I
am getting here might help me avoid some mistakes.  Again, keep
a watch of the page at  http://www.keithl.com/linuxbackup.html ,
and contribute ideas and tools where you can.    Current projects
involve changing from mbox to maildir, and moving to Suse style
"dateext" logrotate, so accumulating files backup more densely.

The backup-to-disk process still lacks some tools - I would like to be
able to prepare a virgin dirvish bank more quickly, and it would be
cool to have an individual-file-restore tool that builds a chronological
history of the changes to a file.  I would like a bare-metal restore
process that was a lot more automatic (Oh, the main hard drive blew
up?  Load new drive, load backup drive, boot, start automatic restore,
go to movie, come back, swap drives, reboot).  I figure I get more
tools when I convince more competent people to use this approach. 

Ah, at last the hidden agenda ... Keith wants to see more movies,
so he wants his friends to write code that panders to this habit.
"Third main drive failure this week.  Darn, I ought to be more 
careful with hammers.  What's at the Fox Tower today?"  Obviously,
the first task of a world-class bare-metal restore tool will be
to download movie schedules ... but I digress ...  :-)

Does anyone know how I would send the focus to a text field based on its

input text fields) from an SQL query and I want to have the cursor
automatically go to a certain field containing a certain string of text.

I had this happen with galeon once, where it would resolve some domains
and not others.  Looking back, I realize that the domains that it could
find were ones that I'd visited earlier in the day.

So I grepped around a bit, and found that it seems to be a mozilla bug,
or at least, people other that us have seen this behavior:

Try this:

http://sonofhans.net/select-form-by-contents.html

I just hacked it up, but it should work in all browsers with decent
DOM support (e.g. all modern ones).  The page is self-documenting. 
Let me know if it's what you want.

  I do believe that it was a BIOS mis-configuration.

  Couldn't find the manual (which I know is here, somewhere, but not in the
file where it should be) so I downloaded one from the MSI Web site. It shows
two jumpers to toggle the FSB clock among 100MHz, 133MHz and 166MHz.
Unfortunately, no such jumpers are on the motherboard.

  Called ENU. Tech says that he recalls it being in the BIOS, not on the
board itself. So, back to the BIOS I go. Finally found the clock setting! It
doesn't toggle among those three speeds, but increments/decrements by 1MHz.
So I moved it up to 133MHz. Saved and rebooted.

  Now, as the POST flashes by I see a SDRAM speed of 333MHz rather than the
266MHz I had seen. When I could log in and check /proc/cpuinfo, it read
'2100+' with a clock speed of 1766 MHz. Good enough.

  I just finished compiling the kernel (that was quick -- I started it just
before starting to write this message. It's done before I am.

  So, it appears that I finally found the correct place in the BIOS to make
the system run at the rated speed of the CPU and RAM. Whew!

  Thanks to everyone!!

  To close an earlier thread, I returned the Fellowes "Micro Trac" and
replaced it with a Belkin two-button/wheel mouse. The latter works just fine
on the console. Half the price, too.

Enough frustration and time away from what needs to be done. Grrr-r!

I'm a little late coming into this thread but I believe you might be
able to get the info you want from `xwininfo'.  Give it a try!  :-)

That looks like window manager data, but not application properties.  Stuff 
in .Xresources is like,

!# NEdit
NEdit*text.Translations: #override\n\
Shift<Btn4Down>,<Btn4Up>: scroll_up(1)\n\
Shift<Btn5Down>,<Btn5Up>: scroll_down(1)\n\

     <Btn4Down>,<Btn4Up>: scroll_up(3)\n\
     <Btn5Down>,<Btn5Up>: scroll_down(3)\n
NEdit*text.selectBackground: IndianRed1


Pretty sure case matters too.  Nice programs document this stuff.  Bad 
programs need to be punished.

ACPI can do that. Not sure how to install it from your perspective, but
I got it running when I went to the 2.6 test kernel series, and then
apt-get install acpid acpi

Of course, I still haven't worked out suspend, but ah well.

acpi -V

I ran an alpha as my desktop machine for a while, now it's a server.
Debian installs fine on it, provided you can figure out the alpha's
weird bootloaders (milo and something else, whose name I forget).

I never could get Red Hat to install on it, and at the time I was
running it, Gentoo had just gotten an alpha port to alpha (ha) stage.
They may be further along now, but as far as I know, Debian is the only
distro to fully support it anymore.

Matt, 

When you dynamically create the page on the server side you don't have
to use JavaScript to determine which text field you want to put the
focus on. Just create the correct focus() dynamically. Otherwise this
may do the trick on the client side: 

...
<script type="text/javascript">
function setFocus()
{
	if (document.form1.textfield2.value == "two")
		document.form1.textfield2.focus()
	else
		document.form1.textfield1.focus()
}
</script>
</head>

<body onLoad="setFocus()">
<form name="form1">
    <input name="textfield1" type="text" value="one">
    <input name="textfield2" type="text" value="two">
...

What went wrong?  Why did alpha seemingly fall out 
of favor?  For a while it was difficult to find a 
copy of Redhat for the alpha and even the alphalinux 
site disappeared for a time.  Has Intel bought up 
alpha or is it owned by HP?

Anyone have tips on finding programs for it?  You could
get Windows NT for it for a while, but few programs
worked where Microsoft oddly stopped supporting 
NT4 alpha.  2000 was never officially released 
on alpha, though I've heard it existed as a beta.
I got mine from Enorex Microsystems which went out of
business two years or so later.  Can alpha systems
even be purchased anymore?  Mine was three years old
in 1998, apparently it had been on the shelf that 
long.  Just seems these systems didn't compete 
affectively with the Pentium II, but why?

Also, if you are mounting stuff NFS, use the nfsvers=3,tcp options.  The

You probably boot right into Windows.  You don't say.  You need to edit
the boot.ini file on your C: drive.  Add the line: 

c:\bootsect.lnx="Linux" 

Also copy dd if=/dev/sda of=/bootsect.lnx bs=512 count=1 

as root when you have your linux system booted.  Copy that to a floppy
or if you can mount your C drive copy the file there. 

The the next time you boot, you will get a choice

The School of Science and Technology likely has students interested in

Alpha was created by Digital, aka DEC, which was bought by Compaq, which
merged / was bought by HP. HP/Compaq declared the alpha line of
processors dead a few years ago, though there were engineers working on
it so that an update would be available to customers who were committed
to VMS and Digital Unix. But publicly, HP stated that future servers
would be Itaniums, because they were faster, and customers would be
migrated to Itanium asap. In addition, they said they were working to
port VMS and Digital Unix to Itanium. But when the EV7 came out, which
would have been the new Alpha, sometime last year, all benchmarks for it
were suppressed, and the alpha was again declared dead, with HP stating
that all servers would be Itanium based. A few folks I know at HP tell
me that that the EV7 kicked the Itanium II's ass so badly that HP higher
ups were rather embarrassed because they'd been touting the Itanium as
faster, which it wasn't. Though of course, HP denies any such things,
and claims no benchmarks were ever run.

All hail the Alpha. 'Tis dead.

Debian is committed to the idea that all packages will run on all ports,
so that's your best bet. Anything in Debian stable will run on alpha, as
well as most stuff in testing and much of unstable. I had problems with
Gaim crashing fairly frequently when I ran debian testing on my alpha,
an EV56, but no major issues.

As for competing -- intel kicked their ass in price. Alpha was always an
expensive architecture, meant for servers, and intel was cheaper.
Despite the fact that an Alpha EV56 500 mhz can usually beat an Intel P3
at 1 Ghz, and an AMD Athlon at 1.3 Ghz[1], they were popular enough. Add
to that the fact that only some programs ran on them, and they were
esoteric enough to be barely profitable.

[1] I had all three of those systems last year, and used them
simultaneously. Those are personal observations of compile times, as
well as personal benchmarks achieved from running my own code on all
three machines.

Hey folks,

I just innocently plugged an Adaptec DuoConnect PCI card (USB2 and
Firewire) into an old crufty Pentium-I 200MHz box and it wouldn't
power up!  No lights, no fans, no nuthin'.  Pull the DuoConnect, boots
fine.  Unplug stuff, no difference.

Anybody see this before?  Not that it's a big problem, the P200 is way
overdue for retirement and its upgrade is going to help fund a new P4
for me (I am swapping a working P3 in exchange for funds that will let
me populate an existing P4 board), so I am not complaining too hard,
but WTF?

Sounds like a resource allocation issue. I'd try telling the BIOS to
reallocate resources by resetting configuration data after turning off
all unneeded stuff like extra serial and parallel ports, IRQ for PCI
video. That mey free up needed resources. If the card has specific
requirements like DMA or a certain IRQ, I'd check toi see if they are
free before inserting the card.

That's all I can think, of. Unless, of course, the card is trash. Did it
come from Fry's? :0

Why do companies try to buy out and kill certain technologies
if they in fact turn out to be better than what they're being
replaced with?  I think the alpha's higher cost was well worth
it, at the time in 1998 only P233's were common.  

This thing runs at 366Mhz and you could get a 500Mhz model 
then where if the megahertz can be doubled for comparison
purposes against x86 models, that's even more impressive.

In all the hype about megahertz, have hardware engineers
poorly engineered many of the new computers coming out
failing to use more accurate measurements of 
performance?

It's sad that a new competitor other than Apple was
developing to take on the PC, yet it has been all but
scuttled.  I wonder if more of these alpha's can be
picked up cheap.

What it would it take for someone friendly to producing
the alpha to line up the specifications
for the EV7 as well as plants to produce it?
It's a stable architecture it seems if you know how
to program it correctly.

The beauty of Alpha is that it isn't Itanium, 
no messed up IA32 architecture behind it.  It's
a family of machines that just seem to have been
better thought out from day one.

I have the same problem with Mozilla 1.4 on RH9.
I found a couple bugs in Bugzilla:

http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=193827
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=188332

It looks like the Mozilla resolver hangs when the DNS TCP request times 
out.  Firewalls and resolvers that don't support TCP like djbdns make it 
worse.  Certain sites, like story.news.yahoo.com, with long responses 
seem to be the worse.

The "root=LABEL=/" doesn't look right either. It looks like grub will
search for anything that makes sense and work down from there.  This
means that you were booting off the first drive, but grub found a
configuration on the other drive that made more sense and loaded it
instead.

Fun with boot loaders.

Yeah.  I did test.  Dumped load (unplugged drives) still not even a
shudder.  Not the behavior I'd expect from a weak power supply.  Then
again... WTF!  I mean, conflicting interrupts aren't going to prevent
an AT power supply fan from spinning.  This is pre-ATX.  The power
supply knows diddly about the motherboard state.  All it knows is that
Mr Thumb just pushed the Big Red Switch.

Mostly: v3 is poorly implemented in the 2.2 kernel series.

Whether or not you have to specify it, however, is pretty much up to
your distro's version of mount. Red Hat and Debian both seem to
default to v3; I can't speak for other distributions. To see which
nfs version(s) you're using, do

  nfsstat -c # for client-side usage
  nfsstat -s # for nfs servers

Sadly, StRUT is no more. Here are the opening sentences on the
www.strut.org home page:

  It is with a heavy heart that I announce the closure of the StRUT
  program. Effective August 25, 2003 StRUT will cease operations and

It does know about the load it is supposed to power, and if that is too
high (even with other devices unplugged), it may not fire.  I imagine
that the load of a combo card that is supposed to power other devices
could be large.

Kulongski's a joke closing Strut.  It saves the state money.  Now
the state will lose money on IT purchases and Beaverton won't
have a program for students to participate in IT before going 
off to college.  Is there anything else this stupid governor
wants to do!  There's only one reason to close Strut, cause
higher costs then demand higher taxes.  I think we should
take a page out of California's book and recall this pathetic
loser.

I'm having trouble with first term physics and Calc II over at PCC

That's very odd - the St. Paul High School just began a StRUT program at
the begining of this school year, or so I'm told.

Perhaps they went rogue and aren't officially affiliated with StRUT?

I am far to familiar with Flex. So what exactly is your problem. 

FlexLM is a licensing software system that works by encrypting a license string to the MAC address of the NIC on the license server. The clients then connect, via TCP to the license server to "check out" a license. 

It was originally written by a company called Globetrotter. They have since been bought out bye Macrovision. Here is a link to the FlexLM homepage which has decent documentation. http://www.macrovision.com/products/flexlm/index.shtml

If I change network cards I have to buy Maple 9 again then?

Well I'll see how installation goes when I get my copy of the
program.

You would probably need to contact Maple and get a new either License file or License key, depending on how they work.

Michael,

  Did you check SAL (Scientific Application Library) to see if there's a GPL
equivalent to Maple for algebra? Perhaps you could use the alternative.

At this point the examples are in Maple, it's required for Calc 4, and
I'm absolutely dying in the classes I'm in now: Calc II and Physics 211.
With the instructor knowing maple and needing help myself without any
personal tutor available, this is no time to venture into alternatives.
I got it at the student price so I couldn't pass it up.  Besides, I've
run into programming classes requiring it as well.  Ideally, I'd like
to be in a college setting that focuses on GPL alternatives with the
resources available for me to get trained in their use, but where is
that?

There is nothing in avalible open source that comes anywhere close to Maple. Maple is a very, very, impressive software package. At least they are releasing a version for Linux.

I don't have experience setting it up, but I sure can break a flexlm
licensing server.  After 4 hours, the designer of the program that
incorporated flexlm couldn't get it working at full speed.  All I did
was change the address space of the network!

That is too bad, when I taught physics there, the tutor center was
pretty good at physics help.  Of course, back then nobody had ever heard
of Maple either.  How much are they paying the tutors these days?

I'm sorry to hear that.  Perhaps you can find a more accomodating tutor at
PCC Sylvania.  Also, if you're planning on transferring to a local
university, tutors there will be familiar with the textbooks.  There are
ads everywhere at PSU for paid tutors.  (Unlike Math, there's no free
Physics tutoring.)

I'm just starting back in my Soph year in the PSU Engineering program
(I did Frosh 8 years ago) and was strongly advised to withdraw if I
thought there was a significant risk of a bad grade (such as having to
drop a test right off.)

You'll miss the dollars less than the grade points.

It's been an ongoing spin-down for them since their funding got whacked
over the summer. They just recently came and hauled away the wireless
gear that we were using to provide them w/ Internet access, but they
were down to a skeleton crew as of about a month ago.

It's a shame. It especially torqued me when I hear that an "Advisory
Committee on Electronic Product Stewardship" is being formed at the same
time they're shuttering a model program.

NW Regional ESD <http://www.nwresd.k12.or.us/>, which owns the
copyrighted StRUT name and logo has said that schools who were
dues-paying members during the 02-03 school year may continue to use the
name in their own school-based programs until they decide otherwise.

Message-ID: <20031008192448.GA5239@gate.kl-ic.com>

I run a bunch of expensive electronic CAD.  Some of the programs
are Windoze running under Win4lin and using Rainbow parallel-port
dongles.  One runs under Linux, and uses the Aladdin HASP parallel
port dongle.  I have to jump through some hoops to make this all
work (like compile custom kernels with security code, feh) but the
dongles do work.

I believe flexlm is used in some way by both of these.  If you
have an Aladdin dongle, you can download the latest drivers from
their website,  http://www.ealladin.com/support/hasp/enduser.asp

The Windoze Rainbow stuff came on the application installer disks.

You might want to test the tcp option.  On a LAN, performance can be greatly
degraded by using tcp instead of udp.  I always specify tcp for VPN or WAN
mounts.

Here are my standard mount options:

-o rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,proto=udp

This is the environment I use for amd on rh7-9 going to an Auspex NFS filer
(Solaris 6 based).

Years ago, I took a bunch of old computers over to Strut.  A giant
warehouse full of old computers and not much activity.  I was
reminded of the warehouse at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. 
I imagine my computers were still sitting in that warehouse when
they closed.

Freegeek is a lot more active, and a better place for places like
Intel to donate their money, IMHO.  In an age of tight budgets, Strut
may not be the best way to spend very limited money.  If you don't
like it, make a very large donation to Strut and I'm sure they
would consider re-opening.

and most software would be better if designed with his ideas.

In general, there are frequently some good lectures at OGI on tuesday
and thursday night.  And often free pizza;  come and network with your
unemployed friends while your mouth is stuffed.

This is the same night as the Beaverton Linux Users Group at Round Table
Pizza on Beaverton/Hillsdale Highway.  Decisions, decisions.  Wait, did

ABSTRACT:
  Far too much software imposes unnecessary constraints on
  what you can see or express, essentially forcing you to see
  the world through a virtual keyhole.  Some keyholes are
  visible (i.e., part of a GUI), others are invisible (e.g.,
  an unnecessary restriction on a data value).  Keyholes  are
  sometimes comical, always irritating, and occasionally quite
  literally deadly. This talk demonstrates a number of
  different kinds of keyholes and explains how they decrease
  usability, increase inconsistency, and can lead to system
  failures.  It will help you improve the software you develop
  by opening your eyes to keyholes, demonstrating why they are
  undesirable, and discussing how to eliminate them.  The

Even AT power supplies are switching, so they control the output based on
load.  If you disconnect the AT power supply from the motherboard does it
power up?  It shouldn't.

If something is FUBAR enough then conceivably the AT supply won't power
on.  This would probably be something like the card/bus causing a short.
Have you tried another slot?  What does the card do in other systems?  I
doubt that an IRQ issue would prevent the system from coming up.

I've plugged all kinds of wierd stuff into my old junker Pentium 233 PCI
system just to see what the PCI IDs are, and haven't had a power-on
problem.  (I.e. cards made for Sun/HP systems, etc...)

Actually, your computers are probably being put to good use in a rural 
school right now.  Yes, Strut tended to have stacks and stacks of old 
computers that seemed to languish there, but they didn't go to waste. 
Once a year they would have a conference during which all the schools 
that were too far away to come on a regular basis would show up and take 
stuff by the truckload.  There are many rural schools out there that 
aside from a few ancient Macs would have no computers to speak of if not 
for Strut.  That alone made it a worthwhile program, not to mention 
their excellent recycling program, and the classes they taught.

Not that FreeGeek isn't great too, but Strut was definitely a worth 
cause to donate to.

I effectively ran the StRUT program at Lincoln when it started, while
many other schools have probably seen greater benefit (due to the
source of the average LHS student), StRUT played a major part in
bringing computers to all the classes at LHS.  It also lead to
adopting Linux in many parts of the school also (servers and desktops,
if I remember correctly).

Besides all that, I learned a hell of a lot setting up desktop
machines from bare parts, and stripping windows/office to fit on
sub-200MB drives ;), or building ftp-install floppies for win98 w/out
documentation. (The linux movement happened after I graduated :().

I agree with this.  I consulted for Tigard-Tualatin SD and we got a bunch of
really nice dual zeon's from Strut.  Allowed us to deploy OpenLDAP,
postfix/courier, network monitoring, and a disk based backup server for our
win2k stuff.

Card is Adaptec AUA-3020.

Package insert says both.

Am about to find out if it is the card, installing in the P3.  Listen
for smoke alarms.

Message-ID: <1065647989.12519.8.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to get WMF files from science workshop which runs under
Windows 98SE into a word processed document.  Course I'm a Linux
user, so I don't have the latest MS Office or Word product.
I think WMF stands for Windows Media Format.  Are there converters
to turn these graphs into bitmaps, gifs, etc?  It may take longer
to get into the Rock Creek lab to bring these up under Office than
I have to write the lab up.  Fortunately, I have a late ticket I 
haven't used so that won't be a problem.  Why does Rock Creek
use software that's tied to Word and Office?

All I have is Word 6.0 for Windows 3.1, way too old it 
turns out :-(

When in doubt, try the Gimp ;) WMF is listed in it's file formats in
the file open dialog on my box here at work (Solaris).

IE will usually open images of MS format.. after wich you can take a
screenshot, crop it and make a .bmp or whatever you need.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0310081507380.25040@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I need a library (either C or FORTRAN) to calculate eigenvectors and
eigenvalues on symmetrical, real matrices. My searches on google, SAL and
gnu.org yield nothing that may be current and/or correct under the GPL. I'm
_really_ surprised at this. What I do find on google are multiple references
to NAG (out of the UK) and they're so high cost that they don't post prices
on their Web site.

  A number of you folks are at institutions where math is done on computers.
Would you mind asking around to see if something suitable is available that
I could use?

  Years ago I had the "Numerical Libraries in C", which was fairly correct
code. Then I learned that it was not to be used in real situations, and the
licensing was either non-existent or completely messed up. So I sold the
books.

TIA,

Message-ID: <1065651941.5586.7.camel@dell.linux.box>

Hey everybody-

I've run in to a problem that has me stumped.  About one in every 10 DNS
querries takes over five seconds to resolve.  It's like there's a five
second damper before it even *tries* to resolve.

I watched my DNS server's end of things, and sure enough, when things
get delayed, they just aren't even hitting the server.  I also tried
with my ISP's DNS servers to verify it wasn't my server causing the
problems.

I set up a while loop that runs host pdxlinux.org constantly, output its
output to a file, and am grepping for real in that file.  Has anybody
ever seen anything like this?  I'm really somewhat stumped.  :-(

The system is running Gentoo, was working fine a week ago.  Kernel
2.6.0-test6.  glibc 2.3.2.  I really don't know what other information
might help.  The biggest delay I see is when I try to ssh somewhere,
that five second delay (which seems more common then, I think) is quite
noticeable.  Same with launching slrn and checking my mail... all of
which is over my LAN.

Any thoughts?

Does the client send the packet and the server not receive it?  Good
old-fashioned packet loss could well explain your random first-send
timeouts.

Is that what we're looking at?  It waits five seconds then re-sends the
packet?  That would explain it, then...

It would also explain why, very rarely, it waits ten seconds before
timing out altogether.

I'm on a wifi link, but only a few feet from my AP.  ifconfig reports 18
dropped TX packets of 4MB sent, with one error.  iwconig reports 15
'missed beacon' but no other errors.

How else might I determine if the packets are being sent, only to be
dropped somewhere along the line?

Thanks for the pointer!

They're out now, benchmark results for the HP Alpha systems listed here:
   http://www.spec.org/cpu2000/results/res2003q1/

and the HP Itanium systems listed here:
   http://www.spec.org/cpu2000/results/res2003q3/

They are vendor submitted benchmarks, but the Itanium (at a higher clock

As I understand it the GNU Scientific Library should have functions for doing eigenvalue extraction. I used to have a FORTRAN library, but I can't find it at the moment (Damnit I need to find a way to organize all of this software....). Here is a link for the GSL. Hope it helps.

Garl,

  That's one I checked. But, I answered my own question by dredging from my
memory a vague recall that either or both of R or Octave would have eigen
functions. They do.

  The R statistical system is the FOSS equivalent of S/S-PLUS in the winduhs
world. It is a _huge_ statistical programming language (as Gri is a plotting
language) and it has an 'eigen' function that handles both sparse and full
matrices. R functions can be called from other programs; I've done this with
GRASS to run statistics on spatial maps.

  Octave is the FOSS equivalent to MatLab. It, too, will calculate
eigenvectors and eigenvalues of square matrices.

  I think that Octave would be good for stand-alone calculations while R
will be the way to incorporate the calcuations into a larger model.

Thanks for looking and replying,

Rich

Yep, you'll see little quantii of time spent when DNS times out because of
packet loss.  This depends on the number of DNS servers listed in your
resolv.conf.  The default timeout in /usr/include/resolv.h is (big
surprise) 5 seconds.

First, set up both the client and server to be NTP time synced.  This
makes comparing packet traces easier.

Then start tcpdump on both systems.  I use "tcpdump -i eth0 -p -s 2048 -w
/tmp/<hostname>_dns.tcpdump".  Refer to the man page for details.  The
"2048" is not magic, but it needs to be bigger than your media maximum
transmit unit including all MAC/MAC-equivalent headers.

Run your test for a minute or so, then cancel both tcpdump captures.  Copy
to a convenient Linux host that has "ethereal" installed and look at them
using:

ethereal -t a -r <tcpdump capture file>

The filters in ethereal allow you to show only DNS packets, which is
likely to be helpful if your network is at all busy.

Now that you say you're on wireless I'm not at all surprised you get
ocassional DNS timeouts.  If your server is local you can work around this
typical packet loss by cranking down your DNS timeout to something like 1
second.  See "man resolv.conf" for details on this option.

  -- Steve

PS: To test your overall packet loss on the wifi link, I've had good luck
getting "netperf" from http://www.netperf.org/netperf/NetperfPage.html and
tcptrace from http://www.tcptrace.org/.  I'll run netperf while tcpdump is
running on the server end, then use tcptrace to analyze the connection and
measure the percent packet loss.  Anything over 5% will be noticable,
though this is a matter of opinion.  ;-)

So what is it you are attempting to calculate EigenValues for, if you don't mind me asking? It is so rare for me to run into people in a non-work setting that have ever heard of an eigenvalue, much less want to calculate one.

Thank you for all the tcpdump info and other info..

I don't have the packet dropping problem resolved, but can live with it
now.

Since my firewall redirects all dport=53 packets back to my DNS server,
I just set up resolv.conf to point to five bogus DNS servers.  Now the
maximum before I get a response is 1.020 seconds.

It doesn't quite make statistical sense, but it cut the time down, so
things are in good enough shape.

I'll take a look at netperf and tcptrace as my next project, I think. 
:-)

Thanks for the help!

EigenValues are taught in DiffEq, aren't they?  Used to come up with
some possible solutions to a differential equation?

It's been a few years since I took DiffEq, but it sounds like something
we used there....

Garl,

  Sorry to disappoint, but this is work related ... for me.

  I have two related applications: ranking alternatives that are not equally
attractive and as part of a multiobjective, multicriteria decision support
system under conditions of uncertainty.

  In the first application, one has the stakeholders or decision makers do a
binary pair-wise comparison of all alternative combinations: of the two,
which is preferred. Then the amount of preference is scored on a ratio scale
of 1-9. The preference is placed in a matrix of alternatives for each paired
comparison. The eigenvalue of the matrix is found and the associated
eigenvector is generated. This represents the rank of each alternative. The
eigenvector values can then be multiplied by the number of alternatives to
normalize them to the problem size.

  In the second application, a similar process is used to produce exponents
for fuzzy sets that are then aggregated using an ordered, weighted average
(OWA) set operation. Because the pair-wise values are generated for both the
objectives and the criteria (constraints), they can be used to prioritize
alternatives.

  All of this is explained in the book I'm writing and incorporated into the
fuzzy system/approximate reasoning modeling system I'm developing for
environmental impact assessments.

  I had first learned them in a course in linear algebra and used them
extensively in my physical chemistry course (along with partial differential
equations, of course). But, ... that was decades ago.

Dirk,

I actaully bought a cute little RCA (it's like blue and smaller than a
pager), it had 128mbs of space built in then i went and got a SD Flash stick
or whatever they are, I have 384 megs of space now and it plays both MP3s
and WMAs.  It also has an FM tuner on it.  I just picked it up at circuit
city (which i probably paid too much because of that reason) but it is a
GREAT mp3 player.  In WMA format I can store up to 14 hours of music.

Thank you,

Don't know if it works with linux exactly, but we bought a RCA Lyra 40
gig portable drive that is made for mp3s for a little under $300.  Comes
with a car kit.  Frankly, I don't understand paying $100 for a one album
player when you can pay $300 for a 300 album player.  Anyway, the Lyra
is great and I highly recommend it.

Subject: [PLUG] Continuous DHCP lease request by Netgear WAP?
Message-ID: <20031008190357.D4807@kudzuforest.com>

Hi folks.  Sometimes real people have answers when google searches
fail us.

I just acquired a Netgear WAB102 wireless access point.  This is
just the access point; no firewall, broadband sharing, switch, etc.
An ethernet jack and a couple of antennas.

I know I could set it up for a fixed IP, but it has the ability
to request it's own IP address via DHCP.  I left it enabled that
way, and I have one of my Linux servers configured as a DHCP server.
The problem is I get this:

Oct  8 18:47:25 xxx dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from <mac addr> via eth0
Oct  8 18:47:25 xxx dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 192.168.100.128 to <mac addr> via eth0
Oct  8 18:47:35 xxx dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from <mac addr> via eth0
Oct  8 18:47:35 xxx dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 192.168.100.128 to <mac addr> via eth0
Oct  8 18:47:41 xxx dhcpd: DHCPREQUEST for 192.168.100.128 from <mac addr> via eth0

Oct  8 18:48:36 xxx dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 192.168.100.128 to <mac addr> via eth0
Oct  8 18:48:47 xxx dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from <mac addr> via eth0
Oct  8 18:48:47 xxx dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 192.168.100.128 to <mac addr> via eth0

Oct  8 18:48:52 xxx dhcpd: DHCPACK on 192.168.100.128 to <mac addr> via eth0
Oct  8 18:49:48 xxx dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from <mac addr> via eth0
Oct  8 18:49:48 xxx dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 192.168.100.128 to <mac addr> via eth0
Oct  8 18:49:58 xxx dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from <mac addr> via eth0
Oct  8 18:49:58 xxx dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 192.168.100.128 to <mac addr> via eth0
Oct  8 18:50:03 xxx dhcpd: DHCPREQUEST for 192.168.100.128 from <mac addr> via eth0
Oct  8 18:50:03 xxx dhcpd: DHCPACK on 192.168.100.128 to <mac addr> via eth0

It looks like it's asking for a new DHCP lease every minute or so.  Is this 
normal?  My default and maximum lease times are 6 hours and 7 days, respectively.
Why all the DISCOVER/OFFER/DISCOVER/OFFER/REQUEST/ACK traffic?

As near as I can tell, there is no way to make the access point "shut up".

Worked fine in the P3, so call off the fire engines.  Only a couple
surprises, which should have been anticipated:

  a) box is a print server with two printers, the second parallel port
     being provided by an even older ISA I/O card.  Gong!  No more ISA
     slots in the newer motherboard.  Fortunately, one of the printers
     is newer and had an USB socket.  Recompiled the kernel for USB
     printer support (got *lots* of USB ports these days), edit
     /etc/printcap and back in business.

  b) keyboard is an old-style AT keyboard.  Could find an adapter, but
     I think I'll just spring for another $10 PS/2 keyboard.

Old P200 box is off to free geek.

I voted for Mannix.  Yes he was a candidate.  Strut isn't 
the only questionable act that has come up.  Why does Saif 
get all the money it wants yet programs that arguably are 
vital get cut?  I tend to believe there probably are 
departments that have significant amounts of cash 
reserves that could be redirected elsewhere.

That shouldn't be a problem.  Red Hat kernels have a patch that allows 
mounting root with a label.  In any case, GRUB doesn't care about the 
syntax of kernel options.  And doesn't go around looking for valid 
configurations on other drives.

I doubt it.  I visited the Hillsboro warehouse about once every five
or six weeks, you're right that it did look a lot like the warehouse
in Raiders of the Lost Ark.  However, that's mostly because you get a
couple studients and a teacher going there every few weeks to take
equip that the school got donated directly but can't use or doesn't
need to the warehouse, and pick up what is needed.  I never saw the
same equipment there twice:  If you even thought you might need it,
grab it, you can always take it back but if you don't grab it now,
someone else will.

I managed to find a four-CPU PPro board in the strut pile, and the
following trip found a bunch of PPro CPUs all before the PPro came
out.  That became my school's first Linux system, and to this day is
the only system I've personally seen that can compile Linux in 3 to 5

   Isn't that Windows Metafile ?

   Star Office (5.2) lists WMF as one of the file types it will open.

   Probably also good under OpenOffice.

   Anybody care to confirm that?

O.K. I was grasping at straws.  I did see lilo do something similiar,
back when the ata66 controllers were first released.  It was a pain in
the rear to get them to boot and run off the additional on-board
controllers.

It's the presence of the repeated DHCPDISCOVER entries that has me
puzzled. Once the WAP has found the local DHCP server, it shouldn't be
reissuing discover requests.

Is seems like it's not remember its DHCP server from minute to minute.

I typo'd while setting the hostname of a recent install, and the hostname is hosed.

I've set the hostname in /etc/hostname, but that would be too easy.

I seem to recall that there was something in /proc, but I can't find it.

  Well, that does it. Or, you can use the hostname command to change it.
Same results. See 'man hostname'.

I was thinking this was set using the "HOSTNAME=" line in the file

    /etc/sysconfig/network

which is then used by the system startup script

    /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit

at boot time.

Hope this helps.

#hostname seemed to work, but on reboot, it reverted. I found
/etc/sysconfig/network and that seems to have done the trick (thanks

Is it ever ACCEPTING a DHCP address? I suspect that the DHCP client is not 
compatible with your server some how.  Can you ping the access point once it 
has supposedly received its IP address or use it?

I'd use Ethereal and have a look at the packets that are flying around on this 
one and see if any clues can be found there.

I'm having trouble with authentication on a server that shares with
windows clients.

When su'ing to a user, I get that it's expired. I passwd the user to
make the password again, and it works. When I su into the user again I
get: Warning: your password will expire in 0 days.

I've explored passwd and adjusted everything I can see that might expire
the password, to no avail. 

I get this, though-

# passwd -S mike
Password set, MD5 crypt.

Any clues who's expiring my account/passwords?

Try looking at /etc/shadow with the shadow(5) man page open. You'll
probably want field 4 set to "0" and field 5 set to a big number like
"99999."

Maybe the ethernet connection is dropping and it has nothing to do with DHCP?

I've seen Windows2000 machines that can't handle leases that don't expire,
999999... , that request a lease every minute or so, but never when set to a
"real" time.

It's not 'Fellows' branded, but I bought one like it, a couple of years ago. I
think I picked it up at CompUSA or Fry's as a no name plastic bag with
cardboard hanger. I didn't have any problems with it other than having to set
the mouse speed to something high. I thought on an airplane, or in a car, it
would work better than a optical mouse.

Wow, I really lost track of what was going on after moving away from the

Thanks for the info. Maybe I can still get an EV7 someday...=)

shfs makes an interesting choice. http://shfs.sourceforge.net/ I'm using it for
remote access.	I noticed that ls doesn't report the correct size on a host I
connect to, so I ssh in at the same time if I need to see file sizes.  

Thank you

Pretty much any USB player will show up as a SCSI emulated storage device.

I'm personally holding out for a good sized thumb-drive MP3 player combo.

Absolutely. I tweaked /etc/shadow and the issue ceased. That's a pretty
weird thing to me, I have no idea how the different users got set up so
differently. many were set to expire immediately, others 99999. I set
most of them at the same time with the same method. 

I usually set up new users with the GUI, having the user enter the
password right there, but these I did remotely with adduser and passwd.
I just looked at useradd and found how to set the defaults.

Thanks a bunch.

there a simple template I can use to create a makefile (remember that I'm 
not a programmer at this time).  

Any help much appreciated!

Russell,

  I suspect that the reason the Fellowes one didn't work for me is that it
is designed for a USB port and has a USB->mini-DIN adapter. Whether or not
this is true I don't know. But it sure locked the keyboard as well as not
putting a cursor on the screen as soon as it was plugged in. The reg'lar
mouse worked right away.

Did you plug it in to your PS/2 port while the system was on?

That's not good for things, and generally can cause problems.

I'd try the USB plug, they tend to work well (although I can't vouch for
that mouse).

  What is the relationship between bzImage and vmlinux (with an 'x')? I know
that vmlinuz (with the 'z') is a soft link to the desired version of
vmlinux.

  I built the new kernal for slack-9.1 with 'make bzImage'. I copied that to
/boot, but I'm not sure what to do about the vmlinux still in
.../arch/i386/boot/. Do I copy that to /boot with the version number
appended, then recreate the vmlinuz soft link?

vmlinux is the uncompressed kernel. It comes in handy for
kernel debugging. It is not generally useful for non-developers.

If you do wish to save vmlinux, it is normally copied to /boot with the
kernel version suffix added.

Question:

Is it advisable to host low to medium traffic corporate websites on DSL?
I've been hosting a few .org and other non commercial sites on my
symmetrical 640k Quest DSL for a few years now and never heard much in
terms of complaints. Of course, non paying clients have a better
tolerance level and probably never reported when a site was down. But
now there is a customer asking a friend and business partner of mine to
host their corporate site for a fee. My friend has a symmetrical 768K
line with Verizon and Hevanet. So I called Hevanet and asked for case
studies or statistical material we could use to determine the
reliability. Nothing available. Do any of you run commercial sites on
DSL and has it worked out for you?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <1341.134.244.174.87.1065814411.squirrel@sautez.com>

Hello all,

I hope your days are going well.

I'm running a web server and have all the good stuff going on it such as DNS, Web,
FTP, Mail, etc.  I have a second machine else where that does secondary DNS.

This all works fine but would like to know if there is a way to set up some logic in
that I can have the first machine backup up to the second and if the first goes down
that the second will become the active machine?  I know that there is something in
Mail that will do reduntant delivery or something.  Some DNS MX record setting?

Is there some DNS setting that I can achieve this for HTTP, FTP, and other internet
services?  I want to know if there is something in DNS that if it can't find one web
server that it will go to another.  Or maybe if it can't find one IP it will go to
another to try to resolve services.  I will be backing up all the data remotely over
rsync and such and would be nice to set up reduntant fall over systems via DNS.

Is this possible?  Do I make sense?


Thanks,

Josh

Well, I use my DSL for some commercial secondary DNS only.  Thinking of maybe using
it for reduntant systems if I can.  But you should know.  The phone company has no
obligation to put the DSL up if it fails.  Well they do, but it is a last priority
item.  Meaning that if the phone lines go down, they will fix high speed access then
ISDN then DSL.  We use to have an ISDN line be reduntant before DSL because the
phone company would fix that long before they fixed voice or DSL.

So, the question may be, how important is it that the site always be up for your
customer and will they be upset if it is down for a long time?

That said.  My DSL for the last 7 years has been down about 2 days.  So I'd say, it
is pretty reliable. ;-)

The -f switch still displays a running program as ./myprog.pl, for

If someone is in /tmp/.whatever/something and they run ./myprog.pl, I want

Hmm, XFS is supposed to deal with large multimedia data well.  That seems like 
a close match.  I.e. it will stream it continuously and at high rates (I 
assume both reading and writing) very nicely.   I haven't used it, but I've 
read this in the XFS papers and seen it posted in other venues.

If you want really high speed, do you need a filesystem?  I.e. could you just 
blast it to a raw partition in block-sized chunks?  You'd need a partition 
(or at least a block device) per log "file".  Sounds like a lot more work, 
but the speed can't be beat.

Best,

Considering how cheap it is to get good web hosting I wouldn't consider 
hosting on your home or office DSL.

Yeah, I do need a filesystem, and I need to avoid the block device
(whose braindead idea was it to break all I/O up into blocks, and not
give me a way to avoid it? :) )

You mean your site on my DSL? That's really ok you know ;) 

Our incentive is to have the customer pay for part of the connection
costs and to be able to run a J2EE solution for which you won't find
that many (low cost) ISPs. 

Brent, thanks for your comments!

First off, apologies for breaking this thread. I accidentially deleted
the previous messages.

The symlink /proc/<pid>/exe appears to point to the executeable that
started the process with ID <pid>. So, 'ls -l /proc/<pid>/exe' should
give you the path, although you may want to hack a script to do it for
you. (Perhaps a patch to ps?).

Starting emacs as 'emacs -nw', then looking it up in proc gave
/usr/bin/emacs-21.1, which is at the end of a symling chain starting
with /usr/bin/emacs.

  I thought so, Terry. The recommendation is always to build a compressed
kernel with bzImage; should I make vmlinuz a softlink to that?

  Please excuse my denseness; I'm trying to juggle three projects and two
proposals with getting my new system up and running reliably.

The mechanism for doing this is DNS SRV (service) records. SRV
records are just like an MCX records except that they're
protocol-independent. MX records are only used with SMTP (so far),
while SRV records can be used with any protocol including HTTP.
Unfortunately, Web browsers do not support SRV records even
though we've been trying to get the designers to support them for
about 5 years.

So, besides setting up yet another system inbetween the first two I do not have a
choice it seems.  The Linux-HA concepts appears to need a server in front to do like
a load balancing concept.  I was hoping for something like the DNS SRV records
concepts.  It does make the most sense.

Hmm, I'll have to think about another solution.  The two computers I have are not on
the same network and are located in two different places.

Thanks,

Josh

Yes, you *must* build a compressed kernel and link to that. The
uncompressed kernel is not bootable.

Terry,

  Aha! Now I see what I wasn't seeing before. On this (RH 7.3) box, bzImage
and vmlinuz-2.4.19 are the same size. And vmlinuz is a soft link to the
latter. So, I'll do the equivalent on the Slackware-9.1 box (tomorrow).

Many thanks. I'm back on track now.

Message-ID: <1065827723.11159.4.camel@zontar.clueserver.org>

I have been using X-CDROAST for burning data DVDs using ProDVD.  The
problem is that under Redhat 9 it hangs the system.  I am not going to
fight it due to it being a closed source program.  (It takes too long to
deal with the reboots.)

Does anyone have any recomendations on a GUI DVD burning program for
Linux.  I have not found one yet, but I expect I am missing something. 
I could use the command line, but with the amount of data I need to back
up, it would be a royal pain.

Ideas? Suggestions?  I expect there is something out there, but I have
yet to find one that works well.

Curious.  I work with J2EE solutions and wanted to know what you are looking for? 
What server solutions and technology you are trying to host.  I may be able to give
you a low cost solution.

One solution is to lobby the designers of Web browsers for SRV
support. There have only been a few of us pushing for SRV
support until now. When I contacted the Opera folks, they had
never heard of SRV records before but still said that they would
not support it. The Mozilla folks said that if I wanted SRV
support, I should contribute the code. One other (I forget which)
said that they'd add SRV support when DNS supported SRV - they were
referring to the fact that few people use SRV records, which is, of
course, a chicken and egg problem.

I've been hearing lots of praise for k3b, which is a front end for
cdrtools (as is x-cdroast, I suspect).  But I didn't install it, because
it has too many dependencies, and I'm on a dial-up.  Looks splashy,
though.

On the other hand, a script can make those CLI tools pretty agreeable. 
My system is fast enough to pipe the mkisofs output directly to
cdrecord, so I can do this:

mkisofs -R $* | cdrecord -v dev=ATAPI:0,0,0 speed=12 -

And here $* can be files or a directory, so it's handy.  Of course, it
may or may not be so simple with a DVD burner.

Well that really just doesn't make much sense to me.  Everyone has a problem with
reduntant systems and if you could do it at the router or DNS record part then why
doesn't everyone do that?  Would save a lot of people some headaches.  Then again
maybe the load balancer and router folks wouldn't have a market then. Ok, LB guys
would but gateway and routers maybe less.

Anywho, I may just have to write them to complain and then come up with another
solution.  Too bad.

Thanks for the info.

Delaying email a few timeouts here and there isn't any big deal, but I'd 
guess that for interactive things (like browsing the web) it wouldn't 
make for the finest user experience - is that the case?

But SRV appears to be only for failover not load balancing, I'm no 
expert but assuming you can place the boxes next to each other (and not 
across the country from each other) failover has no additional hardware 
costs beyond the cost of a serial cable I believe.

Subject: [PLUG] more hardware trouble
Message-ID: <864qyggt9r.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

Installed a P4 2.53GHz and a gig of RAM in an Intel D845GBVL
motherboard[1] and am having a lot of trouble getting it to POST.  I
seem to have BIOS version P01.  Attempts to reflash BIOS[2] to more
recent version (P17) have failed because, seemingly, the motherboard
is having trouble talking to RAM.  Every power on I see a different
quantity of detected RAM.  This is fresh, newly arrived DDR SDRAM from
crucial.com, 512meg on a stick.

Now, that all seems to superficially point to the RAM being the
problem.  Howver, I have tried removing one stick, trying different
sockets, all permutations and have not seen an improvement.  What is
the probability of getting two bad sticks at once?  Not large.
Secondly, Intel's website says that my processor (actually, _any_
processor isn't supported until BIOS P02).  So, how am I supposed to
get said BIOS onto the box unless it will run long enough to load it?

Any ideas?

Thanks for the help/tips guys.  Don't want to jinx myself, but it looks
like a firmware upgrade has solved this problem.  It got itself a lease
15 minutes ago, and hasn't asked again yet.

Doing the firmware upgrade was painful though.  These little WAPs have a
web interface to upload the new firmware file through some cgi and http
send.  All magic hidden stuff.  Problem is that it would only get 80%
through and then it would lose its ethernet connection (I had it set
to static IP for this).  I would watch the lights on it, and the ethernet
light would be flashing like gang-busters while the transfer was going on,
then all the lights would go off, and the ethernet and power light would
start flashing--yep, rebooted.  Duh.  Over and over and over.

The thing has a telnet interface which is completely undocumented.  I'm
familiar with a few of these, but I couldn't figure out how to get a
firmware update that way.  Then I found the ftp command.  Tried to ftp
to my machine to get the firmware file, but no go--always said the ftp
connection died.  FINALLY, I got smart and ftp'd by IP address instead
of hostname (duh), and that worked.  Got the new firmware file in a temp
file, but now what?  No idea how to swap the new firmware in place.

Then I got real brave:

   mv tempfw apimg1

If this didn't work, I'd have a nice paper-weight with antennas!  I rebooted
and voila!  Now have v1.2.3 instead of 1.1.  Yee-haw!  Fixed the annoying
DHCP issues, as well as some speed improvements for the 802.11a Turbo
mode and other reliability fixes.

Thanks for listening. :)

xcdroast is not closed source.  If you were running Debian, this would
get and build xcdroast for you as a Debian package:

# apt-get -b build-dep xcdroast

  I'll ask this both ways to make myself clear:

  Are all _orange_ cat 5 cables wired cross-over? Or, are all cross-over
cables covered in _orange_ plastic?

  I have a small roll I'd like to use to connect my developing new box to
the network, but not if it's cross-over cable. The markings are: UNICOM
B8I12 TYPE CM 24AWG 75oC (UL) E151955 CSA LL79189 TIA/EIA-568A CATEGORY 5
VERIFIED

  All I learn from googling on these numbers is that "CM" stands for "cable
master" (whatever that is), and that the TIA/EIA standard refers to patch
panels. Does this mean the answer to my questions is "yes"?

Thanks,

Ideally I was looking for a way that I could keep two machines in two different
locations but with identical services and files and if one IP from the DNS record
was not found that the host would resolve to another IP address.  There are many
reasons why that one host may not be found.  Cut phone line, building burnt down,
power failure, computer died.  By placing the two computers in different locations
on two different systems you would then have a reduntant backup and running computer
that would go online and no one would ever see down time.

The only service between the two computers you would need is a syncing tool to sync
files and you have rsync to achieve that.  It is just odd to me that the industrial
hasn't used SRV at the DNS level to achieve this.  Makes great sense.

I'll just work with what I find.  Just too bad that what seems like the most logical
and easy solution isn't being used.

Your cable may be a crossover, but the color is irrelevant.

No. Cat 5 cabling comes in every possible color. And I happen to own a
cross-over cable that is yellow, made by the seller. You only need to
worry whether it's a cross-over cable if & only if it has jacks on both
ends.

If that is the case, a quick sanity case is to compare the color of the
wires inside the jacks -- assuming the jacks are made of transparent
material. Performing a sanity check on my own collection of cables, if

Oddly enough, all my cross over cables are yellow as well.  I bought them 
premade.

If you've got a hub with a cross-over port (often port one and often has a 
little switch to uncross it) you can plug it in to a computer and the hub and 
see which port makes it happy.  Check the link lights.

And if you meant your 'small roll' has no connectors yet, then there is no 
difference.  How the connectors get wired will determine its crossoveredness.

call flock with the file handle.

I'm writing something similar to what you're describing in Ruby.

BTW: Isn't it going to be a pain to write this in C?  I mean compared to 
the effort of writing it in Ruby|Perl|Python where you've got builtin 
regex?

The cross-ever is about termination. The cable is the same. You can make a 
standard cable cross-over and vice-a-versa, by removing one end and terminating 
it differently. I keep a drawing with my terminating crimpers to keep it 
straight...

Another thought:

Aren't you using some sort of already existing POP library?  

Since I'm also writing something similar (but using Ruby) I got to 
wondering if this was a problem, but then realized that the Net::POP3 
module that comes with Ruby does the flock'ing for me already, so it's not 
an issue in my case.  I'm wondering if whatever POP library you're using 
from C might already handle this problem for you.

The cable is just a bunch of twisted pairs of conductors, the way the
cable is connected to the connectors on the ends are what makes it
cross-over or not.  As it so happens, all of the orange cables in my
shop are cross-overs, but only because I made them that way.  Some of
them started life as straight-through, I cut one of the ends off and
made them into cross-overs.

The general answer is no.  I've used this type of cable for
straight-through ethernet, cross-over ethernet, Cisco's special
roll-over cables, null modem cables and as phone line.  I also have
equipment that will place 12 Volts across two of the conductors, leaving
the ethernet conductors intact (the personal telco  guys do something
like this when they put their access points up on poles).

Just a possibility, but I've run across a few bad RAM controllers on the 
motherboard, they act just like that. The concept was pretty far outside the box 
for me and I worked far too long on the first system, the first time I ran 
acrosed it.

This is what procmail was designed for.  I've had very good results from
a bayesian (sp?) filter called spamprobe. Spamprobe only scores the
mail, procmail is used to feed the mail into spamprobe, then to sort it
into the different directories, depending on the scoring.

Good Luck,

I think we've got that covered by now.  As a sidepoint, there are NICs
that can detect whether you're using straight thru or crossover and adjust
accordingly.

Are you able to get into the bios setup utility? Maybe
changing the ram timing would help? I wouldn't think it is to safe
to flash the bios if it can pass the POST.

No doubt, but I like good old C. Its simplicity appeals to my
transcendental instincts. Crafting code in C is like woodworking with hand
tools. It's not as fast, and you have to work a little harder, but there's
a satisfaction in the process as well as the results.  As long as you're
not on a deadline or trying to make a profit.

This is just a hobby project for me.

SRV records do have a load balancing mechanism but it's up
to the DNS client to honor it and it tends to be static
unless you engineer a way to update the records based on
load. Given that SRV records are not yet implemented in
popular browsers, it's a moot point right now.

One hack that might be acceptable for crude load balancing is
to always answer with a single A record that's updated as
the load on the servers change. Unfortunately, you gain
load balancing at the expense of fault tolerance - a trade off
I would never make.

I thought maybe Alan was talking about ProDVD being closed-source.

It has a closed-source type name, if you ask me.  :-)

No, I was just starting to study the problem. I've got my own routines for 
parsing headers and body text, recognizing/skipping base64 encoded 
attachments, etc. but before I went in to fool with the INBOX file, I 
wanted to know what damage I could do through ignorance.

Like, if I lock the INBOX file to rewrite part of its contents, what
happens to an new, incoming e-mail message if it finds the file is locked?  
Does it get bounced, or does the process trying to add it to the INBOX
keep trying? When does it time out? I just don't know what happens in the
process when a server delivers a message to my server.

This sounds like the motherboard is bad, not the memory.

  Then I must have a cross-over cable. From the left on one plug it's
white/orange, orange, white/blue, blank, blank, blue. On the other plug
(held the same way) it's white/blue, blue, white/orange, blank, blank,
orange.

  Thanks for the info; I'll put a lable on this so I know for the future.
Anyone need a 25' (I presume) cross-over cable? Cheap! :-)

Well, yes.  Better idea?

This motherboard has a "recover" BIOS facility (removing a jumper).
Therefore (crosses fingers) this motherboard isn't as sensitive to
BIOS upgrade failures as others are.  In recovery mode, the system is
too small and stupid to provide video, so you boot a floppy disk with
an autoexec.bat to install the BIOS without user intervention, just
listening for beeps and the floppy light to know when it's done.

Since I have to (at least at this stage) do the BIOS upgrade blind
(and maybe it's better _not_ to see here) I am not total sure right
now that my upgrade floppy is working correctly.  Right now I am
walking through the floppy build procedure manually to understand what
is going on.  Intel provides a stripped down floppy image with a
bootable GPL'd FreeDOS.  I've just discovered that this image, when
booted, isn't smart enough to talk to my laptop fat32 filesystem.

Yes I was.  ProDVD is what X-CDroast uses to record DVDs.

I like X-CDroast.  It will not burn dvds for me without hanging the 
machine, however. Getting ahold of the author of ProDVD is difficult, at 
best.

Why are you doing this instead of just using procmail for all local
delivery?

'exit 75' sets the exit code in case procmail fails (hence, the or [||])
to 75.

The #user is a comment.

And sets a lockfile.  man procmail.  It's very handy.

> I seem to be getting duplicate messages under evolution now, any tips?

Dunno what kind of voodoo you're attempting, but I just use procmail for
all local delivery and my rc.general (under .procmail) starts with this:

:0fw
| /usr/bin/spamc

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
IN.spam

And it works beautifully.

I'm using evolution where I seem to be getting two copies of messages.
Maybe I was just getting a duplicate of the plug list mailing list
reminder which I sent to myself as a test.

If I have a .procmailrc will my mail spool be filtered before evolution
gets it?

I use Postfix, how can I check to make sure procmail is my local
delivery agent?

I've gotten enough scam email that I figured it's time to get
spamassassin installed and get it working.  By the way, what's the
easiest way to control local email addresses so that only certain 
ones on are allowed to receive email from the Internet while all 
others are limited to local sources?  Course some of these are 
aliases may dump to addresses that can get mail from outside,
but I'm not worried about that.  The part I read about it that I
especially like is that evidently spamassassin can detect if 
someone is trying to trick me into thinking I'm on a mailing 
list where it moves the spam part of a spam message to an 
attachment so I can delete it without opening it.

Where is the documentation on spamassassin so that if a message I get
over and over that I don't want shows up again I can program
spamassassin so it can detect it next time?

Jeme,

For the rest of us who setup spamassassin "by the book/gui", how does it
work?  sendmail receives the email and then procmail distributes it.
Procmail sends it to spamassassin?  Or. . . .

Adjust your MTA to pipe through it and do the proper thing with the
result, your MDA to pipe through it and do the proper thing with the
result, or your MUA to pipe through it and do the proper thing with the
result.

I'd go with the MTA if you're running your own email server, or the MDA
(procmail, right?) if you want to do a more per-user thing.  Google for
it, there are howto's for using SpamAssassin with Procmail, it's pretty
easy, really.

Did you actually use a GUI for it?

The way it works with the .forward file containing | procmail is
sendmail receives the mail, sees the user wants it piped through
procmail, sends it to procmail, which sees you want it piped through
spamassassin then delived to your inbox *if* it doesn't match the Spam
header line, added by spamassassin if it thinks it is spam.

I think all I did was install it from the RPM and created a
.spamassassin directory in my home directory.  Dittled with the
user_prefs and it is working.  Still don't have a good feeling about
it.  Would like to set up a means to tell it about the few messages it
does not catch.  I am using evolution to read my mail.

As I understand the process.  Procmail runs it through spamassassin. 
Where is procmail configured to put it through spamassassin.

I have my procmailrc call it derectly-

:0H
* ^From:.*DirectDaily.com
/dev/null/

# this runs spamassassin on anything not already killed above
:0fw
| /usr/bin/spamc -f
:0
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
/var/spool/mail/sa-caught/

When I'm feeling like I like the setup, I switch the sa-caught line to
/dev/null/

I've also played around with individual .procmailrc files, but decided
that sp_am was sp_am, and that nobody really needs it. I have 30 to 40
domains that I toss like the one mentioned above.

  Interesting story. What I would like to see is the identities of
persistent spammers posted somewhere on the Web. Name, address, phone number
would be helpful in knowing who are responsible for the traffic.

  After all, the telemarketers have lost 50 million potential suckers ...
er, I mean prospects, so I think that it would be nice to give them some
leads.

Subject: [PLUG] Getting VNC working properly...
Message-ID: <1065923660.7263.14.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I have ltsp, but I've been trying to set up VNC so that Windows
users can have access to their gnome desktop.  I've run into
a few snags.  If I leave a VNC session logged in it eventually 
can't start any programs, seems to happen about the time the 
screensaver comes on.  I've run into evolution's panels dying 
too.

Evolution's panels die when the screensaver comes on.  
On an ltsp terminal or working directly on the server, exiting 
and restarting evolution brings the lost panels back.

Another problem is that using gnome's log out through a VNC window,
the X log in screen doesn't come up where the user just ends up with
a blue screen instead.  

How do I deny reboot, shut down, and halt for ordinary X 
users?

The server runs Redhat 7.3.

How can I seperate records of sending mail out from records of taking
mail in?  A perl script that would give just a list of who mail has
been  sent to and another of who mail has been received from would be
very helpful.  Better yet, if this script could figure out what programs
sent the mail it would easier to track any potentially unauthorized mail
generation programs or trojans.

Not that I know of, but there are many such collections scattered around 
the web.

Putting a form tag in an html document only makes the browser display 
the form widgets.  When the user presses the submit button, the data in 
the forum is sent to the cgi program identified in the <form> tag in the 
fashion identified in the <form> tag.

The data is passed either as an HTTP GET or POST.  In a GET, the data 
appears in the url.  In a POST, it does not.  The following section of 
the 'Writing HTML' tutorial did a pretty good job teaching me the basics 
of forms:

http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut28.html

And this is a general overview of CGI:

http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/

If you write your CGI programs in Perl, make sure to:

use CGI qw(param);

Haven't tested this but...

If using gdm,

edit /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf

[greeter]

if not gdm, xdm & kdm must have similiar switches

Michael,

If you put your form fields in a <form></form> tag it will work. Also,
it'll be good to add the document type "<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC...", the
character encoding and it will also help to properly start and end
<p></p> tags.

You can check your html page upon sanity here: http://validator.w3.org/.
It will point you to a few more markup errors in the sources of this
page.

In a CGI script do I put the public html at the top?  Maybe I need to
echo the string.  I've gotten buttons and text extries working right,
how do I use the values entered in bash script?  Do I write the bash
script directly in the cgi script?  I guess my page needs a submit
button.  Is the form tag where I tell the entries what program gets
their data?

Okay, this is my current version of the cgi script I'm working on to
allow users to open and close their Internet access.  I put a # in front
of every line so that it hopefully won't render as html in people's
email readers.  At this point I'm wondering if there are any glaring
errors and how to use the entries to test them against
lists, do dns checks ( especially the password ), then store the 
result out to a file.  Of course if the test fails can I unpost and
the data and clear the form?

Michael,

  Are you running postfix? If so, have you looked at pflogsumm.pl? It may
give you all you seek as-is, or you could modify the perl code to add and
subtract capabilities.

Carla,

  Thank you for the pointer. For whatever reason I never went to this site
before. Now it's bookmarked. And, I'll be spending lunchtime diversions
there learning.

  And isn't it interesting how Europe is legislating that one specically
allow (ahem!) unsolicited messages while here -- I suppose in the name of
free speech (as in beer) -- the legislation is going the opposite direction.
Sigh.

Michael,

There are some corrections you can do to your script and w3.org
validator will list them all. I.e. all tag attributes (WHITE, PURPLE,
POST, ...) are to be quoted, the document type comes before the <html>
and stuff. The validator may not point this out, but it is good to get
ready for proper XHTML markup and close a body less tag with /: <img
..../>.

Do you plan to use your script to change the configuration of the
machine it runs on? Note that the HTTP server (i.e. Apache) is normally
run using a user account that won't allow editing or maybe even reading
the system configuration files. Last year we developed a HTML based
system configuration for a Linux network appliance and had to jump
through some hoops to get it to work. We used Boa as HTTP server, C++
CGI scripts and called a setuid'd C program which would broker the
system changes. 

I don't quite understand your other questions. Do you want to reflect
the current values in your form? In that case you'd have to set them in
your script. 

Holger

  Frankly, I don't think legislation will do any good one way or the other.
We now have federal prohibitions against fax spam; doesn't help. And only
the retired folks on faxspam.org have the time (and energy) to take the
faxers to small claims court and sue them. Over and over again. When the fax
spammers lose, they just move on to a different name. Just like the USE
slime.

  To keep it all in perspective, remember that regardless of which political
party is in power in Washington (DC, that is), the Golden Rule applies: he
who has the gold, rules. Remember the Microsoft "settlement" with the DOJ.

I use bogofilter with procmail and mutt, and use the following addition
to my .muttrc file to mark spam.  Perhaps you spamassassin folks can
use something like it:

excerpt from $HOME/.muttrc :

Mail/zzspam
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that all of this occurs at the user level.

For you bogofilter fans, bogofilter shipped with a threshold of 0.900 .
After watching what it did for a few weeks, I tuned it down to 0.300 ,
since out of a few thousand messages only 11 real messages exceeded
a threshold of 0.2 and none exceeded 0.25 .  I now get about 400 spams
a day stored in zzspam, and about 10 make it through to disturb me.
My peace of mind is greatly improved.

Bogofilter is a Baysean text recognizer.  I like the ability to tune
it, but it is a one-trick pony and uses only the one algorithm. 
I would like to add additional programs to the pipe that recognize
such spam classics as random strings in the subject line, and
strange HTML in the body of the text, then a Baysean scoring engine
at the end of all the pipes.  I do not like the Spamassassin "all
in one" approach - it does not have Unix nature, and it is hard
to add third party modules to, if I understand it.  So for now,
I'll just use bogofilter and hope the world wises up.

I'd be very surprised if the memory was bad.  If it doesn't run with the
speed turned down, there must be something fundamental wrong.  Are you
certain you've got the memory installed in the correct sockets?  Does
the board require memory to be installed in pairs?

If the board has a socketed flash device, and you are truly desperate,
it would be possible to update the BIOS using a standalone programmer.

In order to improve the efficiency of my backups, I intend to change
how I store email.   Currently I am using venerable  mailbox/mbox  to
store email, and I plan to change over to  Maildir .  I plan to keep
using  mutt and  sendmail/procmail  (which are Maildir compatable),
and have no plans to convert to qmail .  I've found tools that can
convert the old, stored mail.  The configuration change is apparently
pretty simple.  I think I know how to do this, but it is what I don't
know that I don't know that scares me.

Does anyone have any experience with Maildir, or with converting to
Maildir from mbox?  What stupid newbie mistakes should I watch for?

These may be bounce messages.  Those log entries only show the messages 
leaving your server.  See if you can find where those messages came 
from.  My guess is that you will find incoming spam messages from those 
addresses.  And errors were those messages couldn't be delivered and 
bounce messages were generated to the return addresses.

For mail going to aol.com, the relay is AOL's incoming mail server. 
mailin-04.mx.aol.com is one of those.

I know that's the norm, but I do not understand why. If I do it that way, I have to 
edit each user's .procmailrc when I add a new spammer. Am I missing a trick?

Isn't the ordinary bounce behavior of Postfix to send the content of
the original message in the bounce?  This is porno that s spammer fired
at me which could be being bounced to the wrong place for all I know.

A proprosal to fix this is to have postfix take a list of anyone it has
bounced to so that it will only bounce the same message once, unless
spamassassin can sink it.  The other change I want to do to Postfix is
modify how bouncing is done, I consider it entirely inappropriate to
bounce body and/or attachments since there's no gurantee the bounce 
will go where it should, bounce messages can clog up the Internet, 
and the sender if legit doesn't need what he/she has sent me anyways
to know it didn't get through.

Not keeping a copy of the mbox while you are figuring out if it is
working reliably?

Personally, I use qmail to deliver to a Maildir, then use (I know:
"how archaic") pop3 to retrieve the mail to a different host, where it
gets absorbed by Emacs/Gnus and put into nnml folders, which is also
one message per file, sort of like a newsgroup spool with a .overview
index and all (nnml even uses hardlinks to connect "crossposted"
messages like a news spool).  It's been configured like this for the
better part of 8 years, it works for me, I haven't given it a lot of
thought recently, FWIW.  It'd be nice to cut out the pop3 part, and it
looks (from a brief review) like Gnus has support for retrieving
directly from remote maildirs now.

Another thought here is that if you are keeping *lots* and *lots* of
email, make sure your filesystem has enough inodes (df -i).  Reiserfs
might be a good choice on that score (or it might be overkill).

  Much as I like my little Toshiba Portege 3025CT, it is now almost 4.5
years old and the Pentium-MMX/300MHz processor really is a bit too slow to
run some of the modeling and analytic applications I would like to have when
I'm away from the office. However, I don't want to lug around a heavy
machine with built-in floppy, cdrom, dvd and other stuff that I either don't
use or use only occasionally. I see some generic brands sold without an
installed OS on Price Watch but I have no idea if they will support linux.
I'll be running Slackware-9.1 (for now) on it.

  What lightweight, thin notebooks are folks using? I'd also like to keep
the cost to a minimum, of course.

Thanks,

If there's a place I can write the data to, a text file, a cron 
task running under root every minute or so can pick up the 
information and do the right thing with it.  Is there any easy 
way to reprogram mailto shortcuts so that they can go to say 
evolution instead of mozilla mail?  Is there a way to call the 
mailx program on the system?

If I could mail the information to my gateways I'd be set, 
course I'd have to do something other than null clients on them 
where I only want data from this program running on my mailhub 
to be delivered locally on my gateways and only directly to the 
program that does the change.  The other option I guess is to do 
socket programming and try to stream the data to both gateways 
somehow.  I don't want mail from the Internet or even my local 
lan originating from sources other than this CGI script I'm 
working on to be able to get delivered to anywhere on my 
gateways.

Did anyone pick up my gateway firewall and masqc bash script?  
I've taken this stuff down now, it may not have been available 
though since it's hard for me to test if my ftp server is open 
to outside clients.  I need to put a junk machine on my outside 
switch and have it be dancer or rosebud so that I can find out 
quickly what services do and don't work from outside my network.



On a seperate problem, my original plan was to have web 
and xerxes relay messages into goose but I don't know 
how to set them up for that so instead I wasted a global 
ip address and port forwarded port 25 to goose 
inside my lan on web's Internet nic.  In essence, 
if my gateways aren't compromised my mailhub is very 
well firewalled because it can only be reached from the 
outside on port 25.  Ultimately, when I get the time and 
replace the 386 with my Alpha or Athlon 866 I want the 
mailhub to dynamically route through either gateway where 
the same goes for all the Windows, etc. clients as well.  
The latter isn't quite true, only hosts for which 
masquerading is turned on are supposed to be able to

  Thanks, Mike. I believe I went there several years ago for a cable or
something minor and left underwhelmed by them. I'll give them a call
tomorrow and see what they might have.

  I'm seriously considering the Emperor Linux "Meteor". It's a Sharp with a
Transmeta CUP, 256M RAM, 15G hard drive, built-in everything, 2.1 pounds
(just like my Portege) and they'll put Slackware-9.1 on it (they offer most
linux distributions in addition to their own) for $1,700 plus shipping.
That's not bad!

  I'll also have the Portege for sale ($500 with external floppy, pcmcia
cdrom drive, 3Com NIC, connection block for external stuff and a battery
about 1 year old) running Slackware-9.1 for $500.

A friend of mine works for an ISP that is interested in upgrading their 
own web site. She has done the last three but now they are interested in 
being able to handle, "online order and other stuff that is way over my 
head." They are looking for someone who, "will design a site and allow 
us to update information and picture when we need to."

What that sounds like to me is that they need a consultant who can help 
them get on-line ordering working, and probably maintain that part of 
the site, but will let them take care of the rest of the site. I'm 
guessing that they will be their own host, but I don't know that for sure.

If anyone has this kind of experience, please contact me off list, and 
I'll but you in contact with my friend.

As I recall, they were awful at sales. They did have hardware and knew what it was, 
though.

I'm all about the peripherals, I've got to be able ot make a floppy, read a CD, 
connect to the serial port for router configs. A laptop is the only way to go for 
me.

Post your portege model, please. 

Looks like MAX moved, too. Looks like it's the old Buggs location from the pic.

Sorry all, I got lost in the thread, and I didn't want to incorrectly
attrib an idea, so there's no quote for me to bottom post. Top posting,
when mixed in with bottom posting /is/ confusing.

Somebody said that booting to a label was okay. It was okay, until I
installed another drive with the same labels. Not being aware of this, I
went ahead and reconfigured grub to boot to the correct device and
partition. AFTER booting to the right kernel, I was able to change the
labels of the old drive and restore sanity and the data I wanted from
the old drive.

The working gurb config now looks like this, as it could for lots of
folks: (I left the label oriented version of the old kernel below for
comparison, and so I didn't screw myself when I got the config wrong)
Also note that there's a sym link between /boot/vmlinuz and
/boot/vmlinuz version 2.4.20-20.8

That's an excellent price for a tiny notebook I think.   Do you (or 
anybody else listening in) have any experience with the Crusoe 
processor?  Is it really "as good" as an Intel or AMD in terms of 
performance?

sure, you can write it anywhere on the disk that your web server has 
permission to write..

You might want to read through the stuff on webmonkey 
(http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/frontdoor/beginners.html) It's a 
pretty decent resource, I think it would help.

Brent,

  One of the questions I will ask them tomorrow is how the Transmeta CPU
(note the corrected misspelling <g>) compares to the AMD or Intel. While
that's a comparatively minor consideration, I suppose that having Linus on
their payroll for a few years means that they support linux from the core
out.

I don't have any personal experience with the Crusoe processors... but
have read up on them (and most other x86 CPUs) at every opportunity I
get.

I remember when Transmeta announced the fruits of their labor after so
many years of no substantial information getting out.

Anyway - the CPUs are amazing when it comes to power consumption.  They
are, however, slower than just about anything you can buy today, in
actual performance.  If you think you'll do a lot of compiling, any 3D
gaming, or other CPU-intensive tasks on it, go with an Intel or AMD.  If
you'll not be doing very much of that stuff, it'll work great for you,
at a great amount of battery life savings.  Get a faster hard drive and
you'll get a bigger boost in day-to-day application speeds.

Rob,

  Oops! Then it's the wrong processor for me. I'll be doing devlopment work
on it, running spatial and approximate reasoning models and doing other
compute-intesive tasks. That's why the faithful ol' Portege won't do me for
several more years.

  OK. Back to the drawing board. The linux-on-laptop site has reports on
putting linux on various boxes, but no comparisons among the hardware.

You know... all the info I have on them is with Windows.

My understanding of the Transmeta processors is they are essentially non
x86 CPUs emulating x86 instruction sets.  That's where the performance
drain comes from.

So, perhaps, with Linux's multi-architecture setup, the case is a little
bit different for Linux than for Windows?

Although I don't think you'll be able to achieve the performance level
you'll get with a nice Intel or AMD chip.  If you want the laptop to
last, I'd maybe see if I could find one of the Athlon64-based models
that are just now entering the market.  If you went with one of those,
new software will start to run faster on it than on a 32-bit chip
instead of newer software running slower than older software... as
things get ported to x86-64.

So, grub was rooting around for a kernel to boot.  I thought someone

  I looked up Transmeta on Tom's hardware guide. The Crusoe chips have a
small, hardware core surrounded by a software layer. I believe that's where
the performance drains away.

  Probably too many dollars for that and the price will undoubtably plumet
in the next few months. I like to be back from the bleeding edge because it
hurts too much to see how quickly the price drops after I've made a
purchase. :-)

To run spamassassin on a per user basis, you would edit ~/.procmail. If you wish to send all inbound mail on that server through spamassassin, edit /etc/procmail. 

This is outlined in the spamassassin docs.

It took a bit to get it installed.  (It wanted dvd+rw-tools.  It was not
clear from the description exactly what it took to get them installed
correctly.  Once I found the full tarball, instead of just the c++
programs it worked.)

So far, it will burn a DVD without choking.  It seems to be missing some
files, but that seems to be just due to the nature of the data I am
trying to back up.

It is quite nice. Some of the options could be clearer, but maybe that
is just me...

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0310121843080.18823@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  This is a new one on me. I built a new 2.4.22 kernel (make dep clean
bzImage modules modules_install), copied
/usr/local/src/linux-2.4.22/arch/i386/boot/bzImage to /boot; copied the new
config and System.map to /boot. Then I copied /boot/bzImage to
/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.22. Made all the appropriate soft links. Edited
/etc/lilo.conf and ran /sbin/lilo.

  When I select the new kernel to boot, it loads it, shows the line about
BIOS checks then recycles to the system splash screen and starts over.

  I suspect it has something to do with vmlinuz-2.4.22 == bzImage, but I
just don't know if that's the case.

  Has anyone seen this before or, has anyone an idea what I did improperly?

I'm running spamassassin in the daemon mode, via spamc and spamd. Are you telling 
me that both /etc/rpocmailrc and ~/.procmailrc are run against incoming mail? If 
that's the case, I could bloak spammers globally and run spamassassin on a per-
user basis.

Is that the benefit to using the .procmailrc?

Subject: [PLUG] Buying a laptop
Message-ID: <20031013020153.GB26195@gate.kl-ic.com>

When considering a laptop purchase, keep in mind that you are buying
a lot of high power technology in a small, mobile box.  Laptops are
very easy to *break*, which means rapid repair is a must.  I have had
very bad luck with Dell (3 month repair turnaround), and very good
luck with IBM (1.7 day repair turnaround).  A local dealer that does
3y warranty on-site swap repairs would be ideal;  are there any?  
Consider long-term support if you buy Brand X.  I've seen plenty of
orphan laptops that are unrepairable.

I run a 1.8GHz Pentium IBM T30.  These are now $1250/2GHz, under
warranty, from IBM on ebay.  5 pound largish, barely fits on an
airplane tray table.  The built-in Winmodem doesn't work with an
unmodified distro (and who wants a lightning pickup going straight
into the laptop anyway, PCMCIA modems are cheap and expendable). 
Note: T30's are real common at among Redhat employees.  The new T40
is fewer GHz, for some reason. 

You probably won't get good performance in something small.  I 
sometimes run multi-day CAD runs or numerical computations.  I've
been tempted to go to one of the 3GHz boat anchors.  I've also been
tempted to spend real money on a faster compiler than GCC.

IBM only ships with Windoze(ptooey) so I ordered with small drives,
and replaced them with 40GB drives on arrival (BTW, the virgin W*
drives are available for massive DMCA infringement).  Hitachi is
selling 80GB Travelstars now.

I really like the Ultrabay peripheral slot (CD-R or Floppy or 2nd
drive slot).  Laptops from a number of manufacturers use some version
of the Ultrabay.  The second drive tray is real handy for on-the-road
backups (drop to single user, dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdc ), and you
will find it useful for moving data from your old laptop.

Get a DVD/CDR drive;  you may not need to write DVDs, but writing
600MB CDs on the road is really handy (floppies are starting to go
away at some client sites, and an ISO CD is readable on most platforms).
Make Knoppix disks at PLUG meetings!  I have 4X write (no rewrite),
and I probably should have gotten much faster.

Built-in WIFI;  probably not fully Linux compatable.  My wife has
a Cisco Aironet on her T30, which works but has closed-source drivers.
I prefer a Senao PCMCIA, using the PRISM chipset with external antenna.
PRISM is best right now, but it looks like Atheros chipset will soon
overtake it in Linuxland.  Many other chipsets do not have Linux drivers.

Inexpensive memory can be had from www.kahlon.com . You Will Need More.

Spare chargers can be handy.  Wait for a sale and order a bunch,
leave them all over.  Price spare chargers and batteries when you
compare laptop prices.

My, I do ramble on.  Main message:  repairability first, compatability
second, performance third.  A fast computer does you know good if it
is in the repair shop or not booting correctly.

I'm running it via spamc/spamd as well. I run it system wide, so it's 
called via procmail in /etc/procmailrc.

You'd want to do one or the other. I block much spam via RBLs and then 
let spamassassin sort it out if it doesn't get rejected outright. :)

/etc/procmailrc is run against every email.

~/.procmailrc is run against all mail for that user.

The bounce_size_limit controls how much of the undelivered message is 
included in the bounce message.  This could be set to zero to not return 
any of the message.  I think it just counts body content; if it includes 
  headers in the limit, then setting it to 1000 gives enough size to 
include the header.  Lots of bounces I have gotten recently don't 
include the message to limit the spread of

Also, there is an option to send unknown user bounces somewhere else. 
There are also options to control if bounces are also sent to the 
postmaster address.

Rich,

I suppose the IBM T-series notebooks are bigger than you'd like --
they include a DVD-ROM drive, on-board NIC, &c. -- but I really like
them. Red Hat Linux installs very cleanly on them, so I suppose
Slackware would as well.

They aren't ultra lightweights, but they sure run quickly. :-)

It's been awhile since I've compiled my own kernel but I believe there 
is a "bzlilo" target which would install the new kernel and run lilo 
for your automatically IIRC.

Even though they are deferred, they are still messages processed by the 
system, and so they are listed.

"senders" are both on incoming and outgoing mail. The "spammer" you 
cited in previous sections is the sender in this list.

You have mail for these places in your mail queue. Possibly bounces.

The idea is that each user can set up their own .procmailrc.  How about
having one central spammer file that each .procmailrc reads from?

That sounds like a solid idea. How would I do that?

Everything in it is illegit and looks like trash trying to
bounce.  Is there a way for me to suspend the queue to
purge, delete, all queued deferrals and bounces?
 
I'm trying reject_invalid_hostname and reject_unknown_hostname
now.

There shouldn't be anyone sending me email that doesn't have a 
public A or MX record to look them up at even though hardly 
anyone runs a PTR zone anymore.

Is the luser directive my friend here?  I don't even want to
attempt to bounce to anyone I can't lookup, I would at least
expect up to a five day deferral of bouncing in case the 
host that should receive the bounce becomes resolvable.

I'm attempting to set bounce_size_limit = 1 as that seems to
limit what's bounced to just the header portion of a message
in question.

If you want to look at Thinkpads, there are good deals on their Ebay store, 
http://www.stores.ebay.com/ibmauthorizedauctions. They sell several different 
models. Some are "buy it now", some are auctioned. They are brand-new with 
full warranty & manuals. What you have to be careful of are the built-in 
modems, and built-in wireless NICs. IBM, the Great Friend of Linux, doesn't 
seem to care about Linux compatibility on their notebooks. I've purchased 
several Thinkpads for customers from them, you can get good deals. Sometimes 
good enough to warrant spending $60 on a PCMCIA modem if you need one.

The Emperor Linux site has a nice chart of notebooks that support Linux well. 
Certain models of the Sony Vaio are completely supported, and I have some 
clients who use Vaios with Linux. Works just fine, even modems.

Forget what I said about not seeing the system hanging on fixating DVDs 
using k3b.  

Same problem.

I am going to check for kernel updates. Maybe it has already been fixed.  
(I have a couple of modules that make it a pain to upgrade on a whim.  Oh

Paul,

  I'll take a look at them. I was looking closely at a Sharp (with an AMD
1800+ CPU) but a friend who works for them tells me he's never been able to
successfully install linux on one of their laptops.

> They aren't ultra lightweights, but they sure run quickly. :-)

  I guess I've been spoiled by the Portege. I don't need a DVD, CD-ROM or
floppy drive built in. External is just fine, as far as I'm concerned. But,
apparently there are no longer machines made like this. At least, not that
are known to support linux.

Many thanks,

Rich

  Thanks, Carla. I missed that. I liked their "meteor" model until I learned
that the Transmeta CPU runs more slowly than do the AMD and Intel chips.

Michael,

  First thing to do is fix the above. All you need to do is
	cp /etc/services /var/spool/postfix/etc/
and you'll synchronize the files.

  I see domains in my pflogsumm report that I believe are rejected when they
try to relay through here. There's a lot of traffic that tries to use our
networks to pass on messages.

  Of course, when I see a domain name I know is that of a spammer I add it
to /etc/postfix/badaddr.

Rich,
   something to think about if you don't want the Crusoe processor but 
want a little laptop (though not as little) that can run Linux is 
Sharp's UM line of laptops.  I don't have any first hand experience with 
them but Google turns up a fair amount of stuff about running Linux on 
them.  I do have first hand experience with little Sony's (and they run 
Linux well I think), but all the new ones are 3.5lbs+ w/built in cd-rom 
drives it seems.

Check why the trash are is being bounced.  Some of the spam checks like 
reject_invalid_hostname and reject_unknown_hostname will reject email 
before it is even accepted by your SMTP server.  The bounces must be 
getting through those.  Spamassassin can be setup to save the spam in a 
trap or throw it away without any bounces.  Postfix can be setup to 
reject email to non-existant addresses before it is accepted which means 
no bounce messages.

Message-ID: <20031013055426.GB30447@gate.kl-ic.com>

I'm fiddling with spam filtering right now, and watching mail
files as they filter through procmail and such.  However, the
spam isn't reliable (!!);  though I get an average of 200 to
400 per day, they can be as much as 10 minutes apart.  Is there
any way to simulate spam?  Say a website out there that can
be instructed to send random simulated spams in a burst?

Would such a website be prohibited under the Geneva convention? :-)

I'm sure some of us could be convinced to write a script to help you out 
;-)  Is it helpful if we're always sending the same thing, though, or 
should we try some randomization?

But fails to say why.  BTW, who _is_ Alavoor Vasudevan?  

"make install" works fine for me and presumably millions of others
around the world.  It is in the kernel README file.  "make install"
invokes[1] /sbin/installkernel, which your distribution probably
provides to do the right thing.  /sbin/installkernel (at least on my
boxes) not only copies the kernel to the right place, but also puts a
config-<version> and System.map-<version> in /boot, adjusts symbolic
links so that /boot/vmlinuz points at the most recently "installed"
kernel (and System.map and config likewise), and /boot/vmlinuz-old to
the next most recently installed, etc.  You still probably need to
adjust /boot/grub/menu.lst (or /etc/lilo.conf) yourself.

[1] a) the top-level Makefile includes arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile

    b) arch/i386/Makefile includes the "install" target to call,
       effectively:
  
         make -C arch/$(ARCH)/boot BOOTIMAGE=bzImage install

       which, effectively calls "make" as if from arch/$(ARCH)/boot.

    c) arch/i386/boot/Makefile's "install" target calls
       arch/i386/boot/install.sh with various arguments.

    d) arch/i386/boot/install.sh checks for, in order: 
 
         i) a user-specific script: ~/bin/installkernel; or

         ii) a system-wide script: /sbin/installkernel; 
   
       found, they are exec'd.  If neither is found, it moves existing
       $(INSTALL_PATH)/vmlinuz and $(INSTALL_PATH)/System.map aside
       (to foo.old) and copies the new ones into $(INSTALL_PATH)

Note also, the build system has been revamped a bit for 2.6.  Check
the README for details.

Yes.  There are only two memory sockets (I didn't try plugging them

This one is soldered, and probably an RMA case, but, heh heh heh, I
may have another case where I am having trouble flashing some BIOS on
a totally different motherboard where such a thing might be needed.
Details of second case follow:

An oldish ASUS P2L97-DS motherboard, for dual-processor slot-1
pentium-II's is giving me trouble flashing the most recent BIOS I can
find.  ASUS's website says it is version 1008 from 02/12/1999.  There
is also an older version 1005 available.  The AFLASH.EXE utility they
provide to flash the BIOS gives me a "data compare failure" when
trying to flash either one of these (BB instead of FF at byte 1, or
vice versa).  Luckily, following the directions, I saved the
originally installed BIOS and can reflash it successfully.  So, I am
stuck on version 0106.

There doesn't seem to be a jumper to enable BIOS changes.  I read
somewhere random online that this kind of failure might indicate the
BIOS chip is failing, the suggestion being to use a stand-alone BIOS
programmer on a different BIOS chip.  The AFLASH program tells me the
chip is an ATMEL AT29C020A (or is that AT29C0Z0A?  I can't read my own
writing!).  The motherboard manual tells me it is a "Programmable
2Mbit Flash ROM".  So, heh-heh, anyone got one of these BIOS
programmers?

The reason I am bothering is that I just installed 2 purported-to-be
PII-400 CPUs in place of the single PII-300 that was there before, and
the POST messages and /proc/cpuinfo is telling me they are only
running at 266 MHz.  The jumpers are configured to run faster than
that (e.g. 66MHz bus, 11/2 clock multiplier should be 366MHz or so).
Figured on sync'ing up to most recent BIOS before playing more.
No-can-flash, so I'm stymied.

  Thank you very much, Russell. I'll do this part over. I suppose this is
what I get for not building a kernel in a year: memory loss.

  I do appreciate the correction.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0310130638450.24826-100000@gisnet.com>

Since just about every message I get that has html formatting and centered
text is junk mail, I want to create a procmail filter to catch these.  
However, I'm having trouble with the action to detect the tag <center> in
message bodies. This doesn't do it:

:0 B:
* "<center>"
$MAILDIR/SPAM

nor this:
:0 B:
* <center>
$MAILDIR/SPAM

and this doesn't catch the brackets as it just finds the word "center":
:0 B:
* \<center\>
$MAILDIR/SPAM

So how do I catch html tags that are likely to indicate evil mail?

Also, what do you do about UCE that comes in as base64 encoded format? Is 
there a way to unencode these before testing them against procmail 
filters?

  Thanks very much, Paul.

  I've looked some more and decided that I'll go with the Sony Vaio
PCG-v505b from Emperor Linux. Yes, I'll pay about $100 more than buying it
from another vendor, but then I don't have to remove the winduhs and get
linux running. They'll put on Slackware-9.1 partitioned as I request. That
time saving -- and knowing that _all_ the features work -- is worth the cost
difference to me.

  Emperor Linux also has the IBM T30 and T40 boxes. It's interesting how the
higher number is a much lower CPU (1300-1400MHz compared with 2400MHz). And,
the prices are higher, the box is larger and it is heavier than the Sony.
The Sony's battery life (according to specs on the Web) is 3.5 hours. If
that's with winduhs then my experience with the Toshibas is that I'll get
much longer life running linux. I'll ask the vendor.

  I do notice, too, that Emperor charges a _lot_ more for memory upgrades
and other accessories than do many other sources. I can buy an additional
256M of RAM for $64 elsewhere while Emperor wants $150 for it. Cough! Same
with replacement batteries and an extra AC adapter (one for the office, one
stays in the computer bag).

  In the almost-4.5 years I've used my Portege all over the U.S., I've not
dropped it or needed to have either the external floppy drive or the
external cd-rom drive with me. When I've used the machine for presentations
I bring along the port duplicator; otherwise it stays home. It's a dynamite
machine for writing, connecting back to the office network, presentations,
light development and other such things. Now, however, I'll need to run
spatial and approximate reasoning models on the road and the dear, sweet
thing is just not up to the task -- not, at least, if I want to be done in a
reasonable time. :-)

  I remember my first laptop from 1992: a Gateway (built for them by Texas
Instruments), with a 486DX-2/100 CPU running DOS. It weighed 7+ pounds and I
really felt that when I carried it through airports and around trade shows,
conventions and meetings all day. Ugh! Also, the AC adapter port was pooly
designed and kept breaking at 13 months -- with a 12 month warranty. That
put me off Gateway for good. So, I like light machines to carry along with
project files, reference materials and whatever else I can stuff in the
computer bag.

Since the PII-400 has 4 for a multiplier (which cannot be changed, no
matter what the jumpers on the motherboard claim), that makes perfect
sense.

4 x 66 = 264

Can you bump up the bus speed to the 100 Mhz that the 400 needs?  Or is
the chipset not capable of that?

Aha!

Technically, on this motherboard the chipset is only rated at 66 MHz,
however, there are jumper settings for 68, 75, 83 and 100 MHz.

Two things:

  a) run cleaning cartridge;
 
  b) try new tape.

If neither of those work, does the cartridge feel hot when you eject
it?  I had a Seagate/Archive external DDS3 drive have the little
enclosure fan fail, which effectively cooked the media and made it
unreliable.

The native capacity of DDS2 tapes is 4 GB.  If you are using tar to compress
the data, or if you don't have compression enabled on the drive, you are
hitting the end of the tape.

It's possible that the part isn't being erased.  When a flash device is
erased, the contents are set to FF.  If it is reading BB instead of FF,
I think the old bios didn't get erased.

A quick google search shows people using the asus pflash2 utility to flash
the bios.  Of course, this may have been superseded by aflash.  To
answer your question, yes, I have access to a programmer which should
handle that device.

Subject: [PLUG] Testing alpha version of logrotate
Message-ID: <20031013172255.GB3288@gate.kl-ic.com>

I could use some volunteer testing help so we can unfork some code:

logrotate (/usr/sbin/logrotate on RH9) is the program (launched by
cron at night) that trims and moves logfiles in /var/log .  logrotate
does things like move /var/log/messages to /var/log/messages.1 and
discarding /var/log/messages.9 .

I am using some new backup methods that are more efficient if files
are not being renamed all the time.  The Suse version of logrotate has
an option,  "dateext", which appends YYMMDD to the log files rather
than renumber them every night, so the log files get only one renaming.

I am lobbying Elliot Lee at Redhat (sopwith at redhat.com) to patch
this useful feature into the main branch of logrotate development.  
Meanwhile, Ruediger Oertel at Suse (ro at suse.de) has generated a patch
on the latest rawhide/Severn release:

> updated patches for 3.6.10 should be done now,
> a src-rpm will appear at ftp.suse.com/pub/people/ro/logrotate
> as soon as the sync to the outside is done. I've got that
> version running on my machine now, but it's basically untested ATM.

This should be decent code - both branches of logrotate development are
pretty stable.  However, there is nothing like a good test in multiple
environments.   Who's up for a bit of alpha testing?


To get the file, download the file  "logrotate-3.6.10-0.src.rpm" from
Suse, and (as root) do:  "rpm -ivh logrotate-3.6.10-0.src.rpm"

Under Redhat, this will create /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/logrotate.spec .
This is a Suse spec file, I have to diddle it a bit for Redhat.  Edit
the file, and remove line 27:  "PreReq:  %fillup_prereq /bin/rm /bin/mv"
which Redhat rpmbuild doesn't like.  

Now do:  "rpmbuild -bp logrotate.spec" This puts a source directory
in /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/logrotate-3.6.10 .  You are ready to compile
and install in that directory, but first you probably want to save a
copy of your original logrotate and man page.  Do something like: 
   cp  /usr/sbin/logrotate  /usr/sbin/logrotate.orig
   cp  /usr/share/man/man8/logrotate.8 /usr/share/man/man8/logrotate.8.orig

Go to /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/logrotate-3.6.10, and do a "make" and a
"make install".   You now have a new version of logrotate, with the 
extra features.  You also have the sources, so you can check for nasties.

The testing consists of using the new logrotate with your existing config
files ( /etc/logrotate.conf and /etc/logrotate.d/* on redhat) unchanged.
There should be no changes in behavior.  Scream at me, or ro at suse.de , if
you see problems.  Later, you redhat folk can modify the config files to
make use of the dateext capabilities.

I'm no procmail/regex wiz, but I'd try a few combinations of things
like:

.*<center>.*

and the like....

Message-ID: <P=eKP75WCzGDkUajZhZ28L=U8OEy@4ax.com>

Hi All,
Okay here's the rub:

I have an HP1600c networked via tcp/ip.
Works great with my Win98 machine.
When I go to use it with my Linux 7.3 machine, it just starts spitting
pages until it runs out of pages. Sometimes it may even print some
obscure, obfuscated character or two. Mostly, it just spits pages.
I downloaded the latest driver (hpijs) and installed it.
I can run test pages from Linux and from Star office.
But try and type a letter and then print it, it just starts spitting
pages and won't quit unless I rm the printer. It spits pages
regardless of what text editor I use. It prints test pages from
Linux,KDE,Star Office, Open Office. Just refuses to work in a normal
mode.

I'm at a lost and would like to be able to get this to work so I can
get some work done at home.

Anyone run across this or something similar?

TIA,
Harry

Upgrading to kernel 2.4.20-20.9 solved the system freeze.  Now it just
wedges the DVD drive and I have to reboot.

Just to sanity check, is there space on the partition?

Also, do you have an /sbin/installkernel?  If so, it is worth a look
to see what it does.

If you've got space and /sbin/installkernel, then:

 a)  save your .config (just to be safe)

     $ cd /usr/local/src/linux-2.4.22
     $ mv .config ../config-2.4.22

 b)  clean the source tree

     $ make mrproper

     or to be _really_ sure:

     $ pushd .. ; rm -rf linux-2.4.22 ; tar xjvf linux-2.4.22.tar.bz2 ; pushd

 c)  restore the .config

     $ mv ../config-2.4.22 .config

     note that once you've been using "make install", you'll have a
     variety of previous config files in your /boot

 d)  configure using old .config

     $ make oldconfig

 e)  here's how I build kernels, there are variations, but this works
     for me:

     $ make dep ; make ; make modules ; su -c 'make install ; make modules_install'
     You compile as a regular user, install as root.  When you get to
     the "su" bit above, you'll be prompted for the root password.

 f)  assuming GRUB, as root edit /boot/grub/menu.lst with editor of
     your choice, then reboot.  My menu.lst entries look like:

     default saved
     timeout 5

     title   GNU/Linux (2.4.22)
     root    (hd0,0)
     kernel  /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.22 root=/dev/hda1
     savedefault

     [...]

Why don't you try that and report back if/where things seem to go wrong.

  In process. As a user I apparently don't have sufficient rights in
/usr/local/src/linux-2.4.22 to run make without generating errors. So, I'm
doing it all as root.

  No /sbin/installkernel on this system.

It varies with the type and model.  Like many laptops, the T series have
1-2 MiniPCI sockets (they resemble laptop memory SODIMMs) that are filled
with various models of ethernet, modem and wireless cards as needed.
Some are Linux-compatible, some not.

At my last job, I swapped in 3Com ethernet+modem MiniPCI cards for the
Lucent WinModems that came with the company's T21s.  Ironically, the old
modem worked with Linux, but the new one wouldn't.  The ethernet worked,
though, which was the important bit.

Linus has a Vaio.  ;)

Before unpacking the tarball, do something like this:

  $ su -c 'chown rshepard.user /usr/local/src'

Or just compile it in your home directory tree.  There is nothing
magical about /usr/local/src or /usr/src.

Hmm.  Try this one:

  <http://www.aracnet.com/~seniorr/installkernel>

It is swiped from the debianutils, but isn't really debian specific in
any noticable way.  I have commented out the final "mkboot -i", which
if you are using grub is pretty much a no-op.  I think you can put it
in either /root/bin or /sbin.  If your distribution acquires its own
installkernel in the future, it'll be put in /sbin.  However one in
/root/bin will pre-empt one in /sbin.  Just something to be aware of.

I saw this when using the HPIJS driver in RH8 and RH9 with an HP G95
(970c engine) on a JetDirect.  Switching to a different driver (cdj550)
fixed it.  Didn't have time or a strong desire to waste paper and figure
out how the print data was broken.

Huh.  I got that kind of output even from the PS test page.

  Looks like a calypso song ... "Vaio! Vaio! The day is long and I'm ready
to go home ..."

  I like dealing with Lincoln at Emperor Linux. I asked why they don't have
Toshibas (because I had two that were exceptionally reliable and on which it
was really easy to install linux). He told me they just haven't had that
much demand for the Toshibas.

  They work on the kernel so that even winmodems work with linux. They
support at least four (and possibly more) linux distributions (Red Hat,
Mandrake, SuSE and Slackware) and keep the kernels up to date for each
distribution on each machine! That's either impressive or nuts.

  Anyway, I'm really pleased based on our telephone conversation and e-mail
exchange, and I sent off a check for the unit. (The airport PO is open,
accepting mail and sending it out today.) He also accommodated my
partitioning desire by making a separate /usr/local. Normally they make /
and /home (with the latter being very large) so I like their flexibility and
willingness to make minor adjustments to their automated installation
procedure.

  Considering that their price -- at least for the Vaio v505b model -- is
within the range of prices I've seen on the Web, the installation of linux
and having everything (but ACPI, apparently, which barely works on any
machine) and the service makes it a good value.

That means that the PCI (and AGP) bus is overclocked too.  Some video
cards can handle it better than others.  Other PCI cards might have
problems too.  Does the BIOS have a setting for the clock ratios?  If
you can get the PCI bus speed down, it might boot on the higher bus
speeds.

Good Luck,

Yep, sure have.  The hpijs drivers actually cover a large range of
printers.  Finding the correct driver was not possible in my case, but I
found a couple that do an adequate job.  I also found a few that would
spit out page after page of a few little tiny characters printed on a
mostly blank page.  Keep trying different drivers, one of them is bound
to work.

Good Luck

ACPI is working pretty well here.

I can't suspend to RAM yet, but that could have as much to do with my
nVidia drivers as the ACPI project itself.

All ACPI does for me is it idles the CPU and gives me AC/Battery status
info, though.  It also throttles the CPU speed if I want it to.

  Well, perhaps their Web page is out of date. I've used apm on the Toshibas
with no problems at all. Haven't yet encountered acpi so I don't know what
it is supposed to do or what it does.

Russell,

  The only file in /boot with today's date is map; not System.map, just map.
Also, I apparently managed to trash /etc/modules.conf (and there's no ~
there) so there's no network, no pcmcia cdrom, nothing.

  I guess my only hope is to do a complete new installation. Unless there's
a way of recovering.

  I wonder, ... if I remove all the supposed-new kernel related stuff in
/boot, clean out /etc/lilo.conf and see if I can find the module list
somewhere on the drive, I can start over again. The source tarball is not on
the hard drive and, without the pcmcia driver and the cdrom I can't get it
there again.

Nuts,

Rich

Look in /.  If there was no /sbin/installkernel when you ran "make
install", then by default they'd get plunked in root.

  I'll fire up my fiancee's laptop and copy off of that.

  Of course, working on one project that needs to be deliverd Wednesday, two

Doesn't seem very likely.  Look at auth/i386/boot/install.sh.  Nothing
comes close to touching /etc/modules.conf.

  Well, I managed to do so ... somehow. I put 'alias eth0 pcnet_cs' in there
but the boot messages scrolling by indicate there's no /proc/pcmcia. Sure
enough, there ain't.

  I think the quickest thing to do is a complete re-install. I've no idea
what I've done and I'm not sufficiently well versed to know how to fix it
piecemeal. For example, there's /etc/pcmcia with a bunch of files in there,
but apparently they're not seen during boot. And, I don't know what I had in
/etc/modules.conf before because I didn't need to pay attention.

  Sigh. Well, if I'm going to screw up an kernel build I'm not going to do
it half-way. Nope, not this guy. Total catastrophy; nothing less will do.

  Lowers head, hooks up floppy drive, pulls out Slackware-8.1 boot floppies
(because the pcmcia driver with 9.0 won't recognize the cards in the system
... but I can try making 9.1 boot floppies.) Nuts. There goes this evening.

  I'm off for dinner -- I need to get away from this for a while. If there's
a less drastic solution, I'd sure like to learn what it is.

Many thanks,

modprobe yenta_socket
modprobe pcmcia_core

Make sure cardmgr is picking up the proper card ID in /etc/pcmcia/

Maybe reinstall the kernel, modules, and pcmcia (cardmanager? - dunno
what it's called) packages and see if you get somewhere?

Well, at least you won't be accused of being a quitter at such things
(breaking the system, I mean)  :-)

I don't know if it'll work with a PCMCIA CD-ROM drive, but it is surely
worth a try - try the sbootmgr disk under the isolinux directory of
$FAVORITE_MIRROR/pub/linux/slackware/slackware-9.0/

A full reinstall is definitely as drastic as you can get - just
reinstall the packages relating to the things that aren't working -
modules, PCMCIA, and the kernel, too, if you re-do the modules.

You'll get it back up and running, don't fear.  :-)

Have a good dinner, mine is just about done!

  I tried a rebuild and reinstallation of the kernel and modules yesterday.
I must have messed up by doing a 'make modules_install' on top of where they
were installed. Or something.

  No, but I think it's time to quit trying to figure out what I did wrong
and start over. There are no unsaved data on this notebook, but I'd have to
re-establish /etc/skel and add me as a user again.

  There's a sbootmgr.dsk with 9.1, too. I'll see if there's any infomation
on it in a README file.

  Well, that's the rub: this all started with a custom rebuild of the 2.4.22
kernel; it was running the default 2.4.22 kernel after the upgrade to 9.1.
And, I cannot get into the machine since the NIC and cdrom are pcmcia
connected. The floppy is on a separate port so that works.

> You'll get it back up and running, don't fear.  :-)

  Yup. The long way around, I guess.

There's a problem - did you enable PCMCIA and Cardbus support in the
kernel as modules?

Odd... wonder how it worked before?

No - I meant reinstall the kernel package and the module package and the
pcmcia package off your Slackware 8.1 CD, or off your favorite mirror.

Rob,

  I understand. But, without pcmcia support I cannot copy them off the
distribution cdrom or copy them across the network.

Of course, you're missing the fact that MANY spam messages (and in
increasing numbers) put garbage in their html to thwart such filters.

En ejemplo, would your filter catch this?

Make sure you have a fairly recent version of Spamassassin and the
Bayesian filtering is there.  You just have to send it your spam with
sa-learn.

That's how my machine does it.  Sendmail uses procmail for all local
delivery and procmail calls spamassassin in one of the rc files.

I personally use ~/.procmailrc for setting variables like PMDIR and then
use rc.whatevers in my PMDIR for actual recipes.

Can you kill them with kill -9.  After you kill them, you may need to
remove the lock files on the database.  The lock files are
/var/lib/rpm/__db.*

In start of authority there are Serial, Refresh, Retry, Expire, and

settings for these determined?

Does everyone use dig . ns > db.cache to get the cache file updated?

If I have forwardes outside my network from my ISP, can I 
get away with no hints zone so I don't have to maintain 
it and I'm not bypassing the ISP's cache?

What is dns recursion and what's fetch-glue?  Why would one
want to turn the latter two things off in a "secure" 
environment?

I feel like a dolt.  That being said, can whoever it was that gave the perl

Just for reference, a vanilla kernel install doesn't touch your /etc/
stuff.  "make modules_install" dumps stuff into /lib/modules/$(KERNELRELEASE).
Installing over a previous kernel/modules, even of the same version,
_shouldn't_ prevent the new one from working, but it might prevent the
previous one from working.  If you want to avoid the conflict, right
after unpacking the kernel source (or after a "make mrproper") edit
the toplevel Makefile, adding a unique "EXTRAVERSION" (see line 4).
Then compile as usual and the $KERNELRELEASE will be different,
modules will go into a separate tree, vmlinuz-<ver> will be different,
etc.

Yeah, don't try to break the cycle or anything, Rich!  Just spread the

Remember, making things worse for people is what makes things better in
the long run.

There's nothing wrong with unsolicited email.  You can't know in advance
what information you'd like to receive nor even the sources of that
information.

Right.  So you actually DON'T know the real Golden Rule.  That explains
everything.

The REAL Golden Rule is as follows:
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

Many people mistake this to be a kind of quid pro quo requirement in daily
life, but that is a foolish and dangerous misreading of this fundamental
social law.

You see, the unstated (but obvious) goal in following this rule is to
create a world in which everyone acts like you where "you" is some
idealized version of yourself, which, it should be presumed, you think
would be a good thing.

But since you're trying annoy people and inflict suffering, I imagine that
you don't want a world full of people like yourself.

Rather, "anywhere on the disk that the user running the script has
permission to write".

That isn't always the same user that is running the web server.

I look at this like Critical Mass looks at transportation. They muck up
downtown for cars. Rich is wanting to muck up the 'net for spammers. 

Same idea. Different bull being goared.

So Critical Mass doesn't want a world with nothing but bicycles?

Subject: [PLUG] ICMP rule, etc., to allow nmap...
Message-ID: <1066162035.11113.37.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I'm setting up apache on xerxes and am wondering why I can't nmap
it.  Maybe there's an icmp packet that's not being accepted, or
something that needs to be.  I had log denied packets turned on
in my firewall, but I disabled that, I see no reason to have a
log of denied packets.  It's a slow machine where it doesn't 
help matters to have 65k lines of denied this or denied that
sent to the system log from attempting to nmap it.

I can connect to the apache server I've installed to it, though 
it seems to take a long time when I go to the 209.210.202.171 
address for the test page to come up.  I'm fairly sure it's
an icmp type packet not being accepted or something of that
nature.  I have to explicity accept every type of ICMP packet
needed because of a default DENY policy for the forward, input, 
and output chains.

For nmap of EXTERNAL_INTERFACE to work what do I have to change?
Maybe I can put rules in my firewall to only accept nmap 
probes from the other gateway.  I want to be able to 
nmap it to see what ports it has open as this is more
reliable than simply trying to go through all the config
scripts.

Um, Critical Mass doesn't muck up downtown at all.  Critical Mass is just
a bunch of people using the streets as they are intended.

You might say that ANY congestion "mucks up downtown for cars", but that's
a problem with cars, not Critical Mass.  Rush hour traffic "mucks up
downtown for cars", but that doesn't mean that's the purpose of the thing.

Rich isn't mucking up the net for spammers.  Rich is hoping to make a few
people's lives more difficult by increasing the amount of spam they
receive.  Would he like a world in which other people put in effort to
increase the amount of spam he receives?

First, Critical Mass doesn't WANT anything.  It's an event.  Events don't
have desires.  The people who ride Critical Mass want all kinds of things.

Second, I think that if you want a world with a bunch of people on
bicycles (whether it's "nothing but" or otherwise), riding around on a
bicycle is a VERY GOOD WAY of getting there.

And it's certainly in accord with the Golden Rule.

Gadzooks.  I don't see how anyone can see Linus as the "leader" of
anything.  He runs a project and espouses nothing but hedonistic,
solipsistic ideals... and even those are subjective and flexible.

I disagree. ANYONE going more than 10 miles under the speed limit when
not impeded by condition is committing the traffic violation of
"Impeding traffic". Those bicycles go 5 or 10 mph in a 20 - 25 mph zone.
If they weren't impeding traffic, it wouldn't be an issue, as they'd
just move along with the rest of the flow, as they should.

They purposefully block ALL traffic lanes in one direction. 

They cut in and out of traffic and ride on the line between lanes and
between cars. I know, as I almost hit one that was riding next to me on
4th street. He was next to me IN MY LANE!

If it's the people responsible for the spam hitting my mail server (74%
rejection rate yesterday!) more power to him.

Yes, it is, to a point. However, when you stage a group event that blocks
streets, you are inconvienencing others. Exactly the type of thing you 
are admonishing Rich about. 

It all depends on who's bull is being gored. In my book, a group of
bikes, riding up the street for no other purpose except to make their
presence known is annoying, and outside the intent of "the golden rule".
Maybe I should stage a turtle stampede in front of the bikes, so the
folks riding the bikes know how the cars behind them feel.

The really ironic part of this is the Critical Mass ride is responsible
for MORE pollution, since they cause traffic to back up and remain on
the street longer than if they all just went about their business.

Hello all,

I was just thinking of a way to automatically alter the file types sent across in
email.  I get 2MB bmp files from some people and would perfer these in jpg or png
format.  Any thoughts how I could set the email server to change the file types
before they are delivered?

Thanks,

Josh

It's certainly possible -- but pretty invasive. You'd want to

a) set up mimedefang+sendmail, or some equivalent for your MTA, if
   it's not sendmail,

b) have mimedefang disassemble all inbound messages,

c) use the perl File::Type module to identify attachments you want to
   convert,

d) use the perl modules like Image::Magick (for images) and
   HTML::Strip (for HTML) to convert said attachments to saner
   equivalents,

e) have mimedefang reassemble inbound messages and pass them along to
   sendmail.

Or, I suppose, you could have procmail pipe the message to a Perl (or
whatever) script that accomplishes the tasks laid out in steps b
through e.

Like I said, it's invasive...

Michael,

It looks like the direct rendering manager in the kernel is trying to load
drivers for a ATI Rage 128 (i would think).  If you don't have a Rage 128 as

Yowza. Nice going.

Made me wonder what would happen if you could set up a black-type-list for 
people known to be in marketing, and simply extract ASCII txt from their PPT 
files, after verifying (or confirming what you'd otherwise known) that 
there's nothing inside but animated/bulleted text and 900MB/page tropical

Better yet, install this on the outgoing side of their workstation ... saving

Excuse me?  The speed limit is an UPPER BOUND, not a gauranteed rate of
travel.

And what do you qualify as "not impeded by condition"?  I would say having
a few hundred bicycles around you in traffic as a condition of impediment
to high speed travel.  I know I wouldn't ride at full speed while
surrounded by that many people.  It's just not safe.

As a matter of fact, Critical Mass is usually outpacing traffic downtown.

They ARE traffic, silly.  They can't be BLOCKING traffic.  They are moving
vehicles on the roadway.  They have every right to use the road for that
purpose.

Lane changes and passing are legal.  And bicycles are an exception to the
"one vehicle per lane" law.

Right... see above.  Bicycles are allowed to share the lane with motor
traffic and other bicycles.

That's exactly my point.  You're just spreading misery.

Is that what you want?  Do you want people to try to hurt other people?

That is the example you set.  That is the world you make.

First, Critical Mass is not a staged event.  It is not arranged or
promoted.  It just happens.

Second, convenience is one of the perceived evils that some Massers would
like to see questioned.  So that's somewhat the reverse of your argument.

Lastly, Rich is hoping to put people in exactly the position he himself
does NOT want to be in.  This is the crux of my gripe.

So you keep writing (though I still don't know what it means).

The intent of the Golden Rule is to create a world that makes you happy by
living as if that is already the way things are.  Some people think that
riding bicycles around on the street for any reason OR no reason at all is
the kind of world they'd like to see.  You can't tell someone else what
kind of world they should like.  (But you can hint... and heavily.)

And the purpose of Critical Mass is different for every rider.

Many riders are just along for the ride from downtown to a point near
their home where they break off.  It's just part of the daily commute.

> Maybe I should stage a turtle stampede in front of the bikes, so the

The cars don't feel anything.  They're just hunks of belching metal.

However, I'll refer you to the above comment about cyclists moving MUCH
faster than automobiles through city traffic nearly all the time.

Also, you do not have a RIGHT to go as fast as your car is capable of
going.  You must respect other users of the road.

Sounds to me like you've got a bad case of the greeds.

Why is that ironic?  You baselessly assume so much crap that you've been
spoon fed about the motivations of those with which you do not agree that
you don't even question it or guess that there might be some OTHER
explanation for the behavior you see.

Do you really think that people ride their bikes only to stop cars and
only because cars pollute?  Use some imagination.

I would rank pollution about number six in my "Reasons why nobody should
drive a personal private automobile within a city limits".

The others are left as an exercise for the reader.

Oh, and way to redirect a comment on your antisocial view of punishment
and pain-dealing into a slam on people doing nondestructive, positive
things.

Then, of course, the spammers will escalate, and you get this:
<cen<!--Ack Thp-->ter>

But in actual practice, the simple-minded filter works really well for the
little effort. I think that using (<)center> has taken out about 40 spams
a day for me. I can't get them all, and I think it's a Holy Grail Quest to
try, but any dumb filter that takes out 40%  of the junk is okay by me.

OUCH!!!  I was thinking that there would be some nice tool.  Hmm.  Maybe I could
just reget email that has attachments of graphical file types instead.  I'll
determine a BMP of said size and send it back to the user.  I could redirect them to
xnview for a nice all OS tool to convert the file.  :-)

Thanks for the info.

It sounds like you could use a better spam filter than (<)center> if 
that alone is catching 40 pieces of spam a day.. have you thought about 
SpamAssassin?  In addition to catching tons of things unrelated to HTML 
it catches all sorts of nutty HTML things.

If you take that philosophy into the jungle, you'll be part of the food

I have the ATI expert 2000 agp 2x, without the tv out.
Maybe these errors are being generated by LTSP terminals
that don't have this card.

Applologies if this list isn't for wanted ads. I couldn't find a plug
list that was...

I am in dire need of an old athlon cpu. Not a Barton, not a
Thoroughbred, but a Palomino of 2100+ or slower. Fry's doesn't carry
them anymore as they aren't, apparently, made anymore. 

If anyone has one, or knows of a store in Portland that might sell them,
I'd be forever in your debt. 

cheers,

You might try CSFO, csfo.com. They have lots of new older tech stuff
there.

He leads the Linux Kernel project and has from day one.  A
multibillion dollar industry revolves around what he says and does.  I
think that counts for a lot.

You are right, this might be easier than finding some outside source
of spam/ham.  I have plenty of saved ham and spam, which I used when
I trained bogofilter.  I just don't know how to transform mbox text
into a stream of handshaked stuff that I can blow into SMTP port 25
on my firewall like it was coming from the net.  For the current job,
I could even launch the stuff inside the firewall at the mail server, 
but I would like to include the firewall in the tests.

So now the question is, are there any test tools that can turn a
mbox file (or a Maildir directory) into messages feeding port 25?

This isn't about training the tools, it is about seeing that all the
tools are working together correctly and that they respond correctly
to a burst of messages.  For this I need test generators.

Go on fatwallet.com and check out some of the less shady deals. Fill in 10
or so. Make a new email addy (call it spambait@ or something).
Within 48 hours you will get oodles. Or do a google search for sex / free /

Explain that to the 10 tickets I've had for impeding traffic. Look it up
in ORS 811.130. I have been recently introduced to a case where an
appeals court affirmed that bicycles are not subject to the impeding
traffic statute. I happen to disagree with this ruling, but that's
neither here nor there. Impeding traffic is dangerous. It IS coded, and
it is the law. The court let the bicycling off on a technicality that
they use "motor vehicle" in that particular statute. Striking the word
"motor" from that section would do wonders. On top of that, he was
STANDING with his bike, not riding it at the time of the citation. I
would have argued that he was a pedestrian, and cited him for something
a little more applicable.

No it's not, and the Critical Mass rides do everything in their power to
encourage that unsafeness.

That's not what I see from the third floor I work on. I've watched
several rides, and many of the people I see are riding in circles, going
back and forth among the riders, and there are litteraly hundreds of
cars backed up, belching exhaust up Broadway waiting for the slower
bicycles to get out of the way.

Yes. They can block traffic... By going slower than necessary to arrive
at their destination. The purpose of a road is to travel (in whatever
vehicle) from point A to point B. The purpose of the CM rides is to
disrupt life. It's a statement, not a journey.

So you are saying that bicycle can share the lane with my Explorer? I
realize they can ride several bikes abreast in a lane. I'm talking about
passing between cars that are in adjacent lanes. That's not legal, and
it's downright dangerous.

Not when it's a car and a bicycle IN THE SAME LANE. There's not room for
a car and a bicycle in the same lane. Show me law that states this is
so.

If I was actually doing this, I'd just be giving them back what they
give me. All's fair in love and war. Fighting spam is a war.

Sending them spam and/or calling them at dinner isn't hurting them. If I

Again, where is the difference? The CM rides are hurting others. They
are NOT folks just trying to get from A to B. They are folks trying to
make a statement, and causing a lot of grief and hard feelings in the process.

Wrong. I know for a fact it's staged. The website even says it. The last
Friday of every month @ 5:30. Meet at Waterfront Park, under the
Burnside Bridge.

I don't see convenience as an evil. It's convenient for me to ride Max
to work, so I do. When it was convenient to drive, I did that. For some,
it's convenient to drive everywhere. For others, it's just as convenient
to bike everywhere. We do what is most convenient for each of us,
according to our values.

No, Rich is simply dealing a little of what has landed in his lap back

I don't see that at all. The intent of the "Golden Rule" is simply to
govern ones actions. Nothing more, nothing less. 

> And the purpose of Critical Mass is different for every rider.

Not according to this:

http://criticalmassrides.info/

"Critical Mass is a monthly bicycle ride to celebrate cycling and to
assert cyclists' right to the road. The idea started in San Francisco in
September 1992, and quickly spread to cities all over the world."

I get the feeling from the CM website that it's not that way.

No, but those cars have drivers, and they do feel frustration, among
other things. So now you are saying that CM rides can inflict upon the
drivers what you are admonishing Rich for.

Some do. And some should be cited for speeding.

You don't even have a right to drive. I know that. But blocking traffic
is wrong, no matter the reason.

And there are many reasons why we should. It's a trade off. Currently,
it's the best solution we have for many tasks. Get over it.

Let's see. Causing backed up traffic, forcing drivers of cars stuck in
traffic to use more of the finite resources we have. That's not
nondestructive or positive. 

Causing ill will with much of the rest of the population, once a month.
That's not positive either. 

You see, there's always at least three sides to an argument, and you
fail to see any side but your own. I acknowledge that bikes have a right
to use the road. I do not believe they should take over the road. 

That's it... Once a month. CM occupies the roads. Bush just took a page
from CM and occupied Iraq. The difference is, no one is shooting at the
bicyclists.

ENU, http://www.enuinc.com/ (two stores, one in Hillsboro). Though they
don't specialize in such parts, their web pages still list older hardware
they've still got some of. Looks like they've got a few MP1200s, some
XP1900+s, and XP2000+s (dunno whether the latter are Palominos, but the
former certainly is).

That sucks (the court case, that is).  There is absolutely no reason why
bicycles should not be held to the same law as the rest of traffic.  If
anything, they are *more* capable of pulling over and allowing regular
traffic to go by.

I think I'll write the my state representative about that one - get the
word motor out of that law.

It may be arguable from another standpoint, though, I don't know -
bicycles are bound to all the same laws a motorized vehicle is except
for those by their very nature they cannot follow.  That seems to
include them in the motor world, if you ask me...

Not just downright dangerous - I'd call it reckless driving.  At the
very least, I'd call it careless driving.  FWIW, I did have a woman who
tried to drive me off the road prosecuted for careless driving, took it
infront of the county judge, and won.  If you could ID these riders
riding like that, you may try a similar strategy.  I knew the woman in
question, and was able to get her license plate, so there is an obstacle
for this situation.  If you are able to ID them, just call the local
police department and tell them you wish to file a complaint.  They
should cite the individual then require you report to the local
(county?) clerk's office for a little paperwork, then you'll need to
testify before a judge.  It is all pretty informal.  If you go the
reckless route, though, it gets way more complicated (read - you need to
bring in the DA and convince them to prosecute).

That idiot would have had a hard time explaining to his boss why he

traffic and forced myself into a car..."

Geeze - what is wrong with these people?  Maybe all of us with SUVs
should go take over some bike lanes.  Oh, no, I suppose that wouldn't be
right.

And for many folks, riding Max or the bus just doesn't work at all.

Ahhh... good call.

Well, if you can get setup loaded from floppy disks, you can chose to
install just the few packages that need reinstallation without messing
up everything else.  Slack's installation scripts are really pretty
flexible in that regard.

You could, alternatively, boot up with the setup disks, mount your
drive, mount the CD-ROM drive, then copy the packages and the kernel
over... not entering setup at all... then reboot back to your system and
installpkg them.

The statute clearly states "motor vehicle" and not "vehicle", as you
noted.  Section 814 is very clear in stating that "vehicle" shall apply to
bicycles and the entire vehicular code applies to bicycles except where
the statue clearly cannot apply.

It wouldn't do anything about Critical Mass, of course.  The statute is as
follows:

(1) A person commits the offense of impeding traffic if the person drives
a motor vehicle or a combination of motor vehicles in a manner that
impedes or blocks the normal and reasonable movement of traffic.

Critical Mass comes about when a large group of cyclists take up the same
route on the road.  In that case, the cyclists ARE the normal and
reasonable movement of traffic.

But then there's this:

(2) A person is not in violation of the offense described under this
section if the person is proceeding in a manner needed for safe operation.

Operating in a large group of cyclists REQUIRES reduced speed for safety.

How so?  By merely existing?

Automobile drivers encourage the unsafeness of every street in every city
in the country at every hour of every day.

This is not the sea.  The larger craft does not have the right of way
merely because it is the larger craft.  Let's put the burden of safety
where it belongs: in the hands of he who wields the deadly weapon.

And they're still moving faster than the dead stopped automobiles... which
are dead stopped every day at rush hour regardless of bicycle density.

That's one purpose, to be sure.  It's also one of the very last scraps of
truly public space in our increasingly privatized cityscape.  The street
is a gathering place and common ground for all citizens.

When the streets are just for the biggest and most deadly vehicles, then
where do we go for our fairs and block parties?

How do we commune with our neighbors while moving about the city when
everyone's locked into a steel battering ram, strapped in and bracing
themselves for the next collision?

Passing on the left is legal when there is room to pass without crossing
the dividing line.  Passing on the left is legal even if you must cross
the dividing line provided that line is dashed and not solid.

A bicycle can overtake all but the very widest of automobiles on all but
the very narrowest of streets without crossing the dividing line.
Typically, they need about 18 inches.

The law doesn't say whether there's room.  That would be absurd.  (How
could the law know the dimensions of every vehicle on every street in
every circumstance?)

The law does say, however, that overtaking a vehicle within the lane is
legal.

And war is stupid because it does not bring more happiness to the world,

The difference between riding bicycles in the street joyously, beckoning

unpleasantries you suffer?  I think there's a huge difference.  It is in
intent.  One is positive, the other negative.

I think they are people out travelling the city's roads and having loads
of fun and spreading joy in the process.

The only people who feel grief and hard feelings are the lonesome auto
commuters stuck in their little coffins alone lamenting their huge
machine's inability to navigate a city with the grace, speed, and agility
of a bicycle.

Convenience is YOUR value, though.  I don't ride my bicycle around the
city because it's convenient.  I do it because it's the right thing to do.
It is respectful and sociable and non-destructive.

Convenience is the bottom rung "value".  When ALL other aspects are equal,
convenience might be considered as a tie-breaker.

Putting convenience above other values is nothing but false laziness and
greed.

Right.  Spreading the misery.  He HATES what's in his lap and he's trying
to amplify that hate.  He doesn't WANT to get spam, but he wishes that on
others.  He wants to increase the amount of misery in the world.

But WHY govern your actions if not to make the world a better place?  The

That's just one guy's opinion.  Have you met him?  Does he ride in
Portland?

Every time a group of cyclists is the predominant traffic on a particular
roadway, we call it a Critical Mass.

There is no such thing as THE CM website, sir.

I could register linuxhacker.info and write that the purpose of hacking
Linux systems is to align the planets and bring about harmonic resonance
on the 8th plane of consciousness, but that wouldn't make it TRUE for all
Linux hackers.

Are you particularly gullible or not very well socialized?  The endless
variety of human motivation in any common action should be patently
obvious to anyone who bothers to get to know a number of people from
different walks of life and backgrounds.

Hell, I know a guy who rides in every Mass he can find because he thinks
it helps him get laid.  Perhaps he should register criticalmasses.info in
order to convince you that it's a dating service.

I think the cyclists would have no trouble weaving around the turtles with

Oh, and if you could prove that the turtles were using the road of their

OK, so NOW there are "several CM websites".  Good step.

Now are you willing to admit that those are only the opinions of the
authors of those websites?  And then that those opinions account for only
maybe six or perhaps ten of the thousands of people who ride Critical Mass
(assuming, of course, that ANYONE who actually rides Critical Mass agrees
with the sentiments of the website authors)?

So you've spoken to several people that ride for that reason.  That's all
you know.

I don't think you could convince anyone that people who want to stop cars
because they pollute would do so by purposely pissing off car drivers.
That makes absolutely no sense.  Rather than assuming that thousands of
people are idiots and wrong, perhaps you should be a charitable and wise
person and search for a rationale that is less asinine.

I read lots of assertions from you about what other people think and why
they do what they do, but you haven't asked a single question of me
regarding my opinions or motivations.  I think you carefully select your
sample set in order to support your preconceived notions.

There are some, but they are all for such special cases that on a day to

If by "best solution" you mean "the solution that takes the least amount
of thought, consideration, and effort", you'd be right.  But that's a
really shitty and pessimistic definition of "best".

Personally, I have more hope and ambition than that.

Rush hour happens every day regardless of the bicycle content of the road.
I don't believe there's any evidence at all to support the idea that
traffic is MORE backed up because of a Critical Mass ride.

> Causing ill will with much of the rest of the population, once a month.

Many people are actively waving and smiling, sharing literate and candy,
and all around spreading love and joy.  The ill will rests entirely with
those who cannot see beyond their own dashboards and respect that they
live in a city with all kinds of other people with all kinds of other
goals and desires.

Ill will is the product of the sick mind.  Ill will is for those who
cannot forgive and respect.

What you call a "take over" I call "reasonable use".

Your view of the "take over" is the one that was asserted at the begining
of this thread (irrationally) and persists to this moment.  I've given
SEVERAL alternative arguments on the other side and you've stuck to just
the one.

Oh dear lord.  So a bunch of people riding bicycles down the street every
once in a while is equivalent to murdering thousands of people and bombing
the living shit out of occupied land?

Phew.  I guess I can't argue with that sound morality.

They are.  The law about impeding traffic ONLY applies to motor vehicles.
The rest of traffic is exempt.

Wow.  You realize that your statement implies that bicycles are NOT

That's what we'd call a "double standard".  Bicycles are not "regular
traffic", so they should step aside and let that through.  But bicycles
ARE "regular traffic" and should abide by the same laws as everything
else.

Using the streets for any purpose other than travelling in the shortest

What do you think of block parties?

How about parades?

What about Sunday drives in the country?

Kickball in the street?

Sounds like you need some lifestyle re-evaluation.  You could make it work
and probably free up lots of time for your self, family and friends, if
you wanted to put an ounce of effort into creating a more pleasant life.

Or you can continue to follow the heard and do as you're instructed, live
in the 'burbs and work miles and miles away from home, spend a quarter of
your income on your transportation, waste a tenth of every working day
just getting to and from work, use the largest room in your house to store
your vehicle, and rely upon tens of thousands of dollars in government
subsidies to support this ignorant lifestyle and provide public storage
for that piece of your private residence that you insist on dragging
around everywhere you go.

Do that.  It's very responsible and respectful.

Well, then it's a good thing I live in a civil society and not the jungle.

You know, we LEFT the jungle so that we didn't have fuck over every other
living thing in order to survive.  We built civilization so that we could
be successful AND good to each other.

Basing your civilization on the law of the jungle is not only mean and
ugly, but oxymoronic.

And more often, carefully choosing your crops for the location and
ensuring reasonable diversity of life in the soil means you don't have to
do either.

And you don't end up destroying the land in a few hundred years so that
nothing will grow there for a long time.

So, you're saying that you're not interested in the training, but
testing the tools? Training is easy, cuz I used old mail, but to test on

fetchmail could pull them in off an external server, right through your
firewall.  I think I even saw a GUI for it.  This would be a POP port
(or IMAP if you want), not SMTP.  Would the port matter?

For the SMTP port, your going to have to have the external server dish
them back to you.

How about a .forward on your internal box that goes back out to a new
account on the external box, this external box has a .forward to a new
user on your internal box.  Use fetchmail to start the cycle by pulling
from a POP server running on the external box.

Kinda circular, and it could hammer your network pretty hard, but it
should do the trick.  You might think about renting an extra IP address
from your ISP to do this test (if you can), having physical access to
the external server really helps.  I think the $5 a month is worth it.

I take no responsibility if this crashes any routers or breaks any
firewalls.

I am an agressive driver. I love it.
I learned to drive in the Allston-Brighton section of Boston, and after many 
years away, I returned for a Thanksgivingday visit. It was touching to be 
"amongst my own," so to speak, in that everyone around me made the same kind 
of assumptions about traffic, driving, and those puny obnoxious obstacles to 
getting from here to the place I'm already thinking about (Steven Covey: 
"Begin with the end in mind") notably bicycles, pedestrians, and (sometimes) 
loose dogs.

Pedestrian laws are set to become even dumber in Portland starting in January. 
The Boston response will be to allow one's brakes to get a little squeaky 
(not physically unsafe, just noisy.) Since most pedestrians are gullible 
enough to confuse noise with an inability to stop, you can use this sound to 
intimidate them into staying on the curb and out of your way - which is where 
they all belong after work is done - out of your way, so you can start taking 
on other drivers, mano a mano.

(Personally, I'd like to design a kind of bumper-mounted unfoldable fence. 
Think of the wicket-shaped things they put on school buses, but make it two 
or three stages long, with a Wiley Coyote type controller. Here you are 
decelerating from 45 to 0 for a momentary stop for a right-on-red. The moment 
you stop, you will of course punch-it to sqeeze into the gap between the next 
two cars of cross traffic. Now, in REAL hard-core driving, if there are a few 
open parking spaces on the cross street to your right, you stop, and then 
accelerate into the parking spaces just like a highway on-ramp, then make 
your cut-in. Obviously this means we have no time for foot-traffic at the 
corner, so it would be neat to unfold a portable fence ahead of time, which 
by keeping pedestrians on the curb, prevents them from invoking that stupid 
20-foot rule.)

With this, Allow me to quote some lines from the infamous "Boston Driver's 
Handbook" (Gershkoff/Trachtman, c.1982.)

"Bike riders are a strange bunch. They tend to feel very self-righteous about 
physical fitness, saving energy, and preserving the environment, yet at the 
same time they fail to realize they are breathing more exhaust than anybody 
else. They claim they have a right to be a part of the traffic stream, but 
the truth is they can't cut it in the Big Leagues. Sometimes, they take up 
enough of the road to slow traffic down significantly, and corrective 
measures are required."

(Note: I once had the pleasure of driving through Bean-town during an 
afternoon blackout. Guess what happened? With no traffic lights, drivers on 
Mass. Ave from Harvard inbouund were averaging about 55mph. Awesome. 
Efficient. Anyways, so for Boston drivers, 45 - 55mph feels just about right 
in-town.)

"When you see 'Lefty' (wrong-way biker) coming at you, just pull to the right 
slightly and coax him gently off the road. [...] As a general policy we 
advocate putting bicyclists in their place: either walking their bikes on the 
sidewalk or riding them on bike paths, as far as possible from the world of 
Boston Driving."

"[Another] type of bicycle rider, known as 'Aggressor,' is always racing 
against traffic. He usually loses, but that doesn't bother him. As a general 
rule he will keep to the far right if he cannot keep up with the cars; at the 
same speed as traffic, he will move left to take up a full lane. [...] At a 
light he will weave to the front of the line, give a quick glance for 
cross-traffic, and run the light, barely missing a stride.

If one blocks your way, the best thing to do is to try to sidesqueeze him into 
the middle of the traffic stream. This will force the bicyclist to weave and 
will usually occupy him enough to allow you to pass him. But beware: if he's 
good, he will move with you and prevent you from doing so."

(GLL: This is where Boston potholes come in handy...)

  The frustration with the rootdisk, pcmcia.dsk, is that only the version
from 8.1 recognizes my external, pcmcia-connected "LG" brand cdrom drive.
The ones that come with 9.0 and 9.1 just do not see that drive, so I get to
the point of specifying from where the source files are to be installed and
it's a black hole to the installer. Sigh. Of course, I wrote to Patrick
about this when the 9.0 set came but I never received any response.

  Well, as long as I had totally trashed the system (I doubt that learning
how would have been possible), I re-installed 8.1 last evening. Today I'll
upgrade to 9.1 and leave the stock kernel alone. :-)

  Then I'll copy over the .bashrc and .bash_profile that Slackware does not
have, fill in /etc/skel, /etc/host*, add me again as a user and get back to
the real world. Oh, ... I need to tinker with /etc/rc.d/rc.network, too.

  I may very well have mis-configured the kernel and missed the pcmcia
driver I needed. I don't know. Painful waste of time, that's what it's been.
I will note, however, that I found it easier to upgrade from 8.1 -> 9.0 ->
9.1 than it was doing the equivalent upgrades on Red Hat. Perhaps that's
related to changes between versions, but the Red Hat major version upgrades
were always complex and fraught with potential dangers -- for me.

Thanks,

No. It requires the operator of the vehicle to do something that
potentially endangers someone, including the operator. If I'm traveling
alone on US 26 at 100 mph, I'm not only eligible for a speeding ticket,
but also a reckless (careless) driving ticket. 

> The cars are the dangerous weapons on the street, not the bicycles.

Um, I have seen what a bicycle does to a pedestrian. So don't tell me
bicycles aren't dangerous too. I have a friend who wrecked on his bike
with no help from anyone else. Messed up his shoulder and cut him up
pretty bad.

What collision? He scared the hell out of me when he came up behind me
and tried to pass me, between me and the car in the next lane. The
bicycle was speeding, as I was going (with the flow of traffic) 20 mph
on SW 4th street. He was going faster than everyone else was.

Not likely. My Max commute takes longer than driving. Consequently, if I
didn't Max, I'd have more time with my family and friends. The ONLY
thing I gain by Maxing is not paying for parking and some time to read
the paper. However, I could just as easily read the paper at lunch, so
it's not actually time gained. Not to mention it's a pain to read the
paper standing up and being jostled around.

You actually believe this? 

I live where I live because I couldn't afford to live closer to town.
I'm within 5 blocks of a large grocery store (a mall really), I don't
have a garage. Not to mention I wouldn't want my kids to go to Portland
Public Schools. I'm not interested in trying to change them at this late
date in their school career. By the time anyone was able to get Derry
out of that position, my kids will be out of College. If I have a choice
(and I did) I will move to a place with better schools. Then there's the
crime rate. I could go on. 

In addition, there isn't room in "inner Portland" for all the folks that
live in "suburban Portland". It's a pipe dream. It's also a pipe dream
to think that folks will live close to where they work. My place of
employment has moved 3 times in the last 5 years, and only once was that
because I changed jobs.

Setting up computer projectors is hard, especially setting up that old
Proxima's 640x480 from a random laptop.  Some of the newer projectors
scan-convert, which leads to a shitty looking picture but quicker
laptop setup.  However, XFree is certainly powerful enough and XConfig
files versatile enough that there is almost guaranteed to be a workable
solution for 98% of laptops and 98% of projectors.  The problem, Linux
or Windows, new projector or old, is finding that solution in a few
minutes before a talk.  This has plagued projectors since day one.

  *******************************************************************
  This is actually a career opportunity for one of us!  What about an 
  open-source tool that does this configuration semi-automagically?  
  *******************************************************************

Is there someone here with a smidgen of programming skill (this would
not take much, probably a tiny bit of perl programming) willing to do 
the experimentation necessary, then write a program and a user's guide?
There would be a lot of writing (Mini-Howtos with the setup formula for
every machine) and a lot of user-empathy needed for a friendly design.
You will have to learn XConfig, of course.  But after a while, the
Mini-Howtos will be contributed over the net, so this will not take
forever to complete.

A smallish script driven by a big table of projectors and a big table of
laptops (with accompanying setup formulas) followed by some experimental
algorithms for laptops and projectors not listed, would likely reduce
the fiddling around to seconds or at most minutes.  It would be an
excellent skill advertisment (your splash screen would be projected
worldwide thousands of times a day), and an excellent way to promote
Linux ("This Microsoft junk isn't working!  Go get the Linux laptop!").

Talk about low hanging fruit!  We probably have half-a-dozen projectors
and 30 different kinds of laptops among us, and we are mostly helpful
and friendly types;  whoever took this on as a project would be able
to get a lot of testing experience rapidly.  InFocus and Compview
are in town, and probably would provide access to projectors for the
development of the second version of the program (and if you wanted a
job at such places, this would be a good way to get it).   

Zot, I'm *glad* that hard-to-configure projector is giving you fits, 
because this could lead to a new Linux tool, one that closed-source
Windows will never be able to match.  It could also lead to a good
job for an ambitious PLUG member.  Scratch that itch!

The thing that made it a waste was that you chose to flush the

the clinic this Saturday and have someone show you how to build a

Okay, so now we all realize that 
Portland is a very poorly designed 
city when it comes to transportation 
where all the bridges it has are a 
real monetary drain.

There's a north and south transportation 
bottleneck.  One thing that's alarming 
is that PSU and PCC are trying to grow, 
yet any parking being added is needed 
even before these expansions.  They 
really need to spread out more.  A PCC 
branch in St. Helens would be nice.

The other option is regular, reliable, cost 
affective, fast public transportation system 
out to Scappoose and St. Helens, but that's not 
likely to happen anytime soon.  The original 
plans to run Cornelius pass across Sauvie's 
Island to Vancouver will eventually have to 
be implemented.  I for one don't see why 
you have to change the farm zoning to run 
a highway through.  The greater concern is 
law enforcement. Then again, that would 
probably improve it since the highway 
would start in the center of the island.  
The greater concern is the dikes, it's been 
50 years since my grandfather built many of 
them where they are weakened over time by 
burrowing animals and erosion.

This helps explain why most of Boston is hideous to behold.  Travelling is
more than just transport.  Appreciation and care for the space through
which you travel.  When people just think of places as destinations (and
worse, as just INTERIOR destinations), exteriors and spaces between are
neglected and ugliness sets in and streets become unpleasant places.

The customized interior space of an automobile insulates a person from
their surroundings and further separates a person from their community and
city.  And as the spaces between destinations get less and less pleasant
to experience, people choose to spend more of their time confined in those
insulating interiors.

The most pleasant spaces to travel in Boston are, not coincidentally, in
those regions where it is most difficult to drive a car at non-human
speeds; Beacon Hill, the North end, etc.

Again, you threaten violence to get your way without consideration for the
people you threaten except insofar as whether or not they respond to your
threat.  This kind of behavior is not only violent and disrespectful, but
antisocial and uncivil.

Why do you bother living in civilization at all?

People with this kind of attitude reap the benefits of civil society while
chipping away at the very foundation that allows it to exist at all.  They
undermine civilization itself and impede any kind of human progress.

So you'd attempt to control human beings like cattle for your convenience.

That's too sick to be funny, even.  Do you have no respect for other
people?  You're like Alex in A Clockwork Orange.  It's all about your own
personal pleasure and convenience and if violence is what you need to use
to get it, you'll do it.  Does this bother you at all?  Do you really want
to live in a world where you have to watch your back all the time for
suspicion that someone might stab you for their convenience?  Do you like
to be treated like cattle and shoved around by people who think they're
more important than you are?  Why would you propogate such a notion and
make that world?

I don't think ANY cyclist doesn't recognize that he breathes more exhaust
than anybody else.

This is like Russell's arguments about the purpose of Critical Mass.  The
author presumes he knows the minds of others, then points out an obvious
contradiction with reality but assumes this is the fault of the presumed
cyclist and not a flaw in the presumptions of the author.  This is clearly
a case of someone wanting to call another person stupid rather than
wanting to understand and love other people.

But I guess that's to be expected from someone that advocates violence
against people for being inconvenient.

Except for the fact that there ARE cyclists and pedestrians and drivers
that who do not WANT to travel at that speed but are compelled by the
constant threat of collision with the deadly violent aggressors.

First, I certainly don't advocate someone cycling the wrong way on the
street.  It's dangerous, illegal, and dumb.

Second, threat of deadly violence is hardly gentle.

Third, it's not your place to coax anyone into anything with regard to the
public roadways.

This is contrary to the law and civility.  It's selfish and all-around
fucked-up thinking.

I don't know about "racing against traffic", but I would say that, in
town, I pass more cars than pass me.  It's just the nature of the system.
My vehicle is more agile and less prone to the impediment of congestion.

Of course, the statement above is an attempt by the author to bolster his
own ego by calling someone else a "loser" (by losing the "race").
Travelling is not a competition and viewing it as such is putting needless
friction into what could be a joyful experience.

In most places, this is the law.

In Oregon, at least, this is also the law.

This is the law in Idaho and soon to be the law in Oregon.

This is self-contradictory.  If the cyclist is only in the middle of the
lane when he is travelling at the rate of the rest of the traffic, why
would he be blocking anyone's way?

(And the persistent use of the terms "my way" and "your way" is erroneous
and subtly arrogant.  A road is just a way.  It is not mine or yours.
When we both are using it, it could be called our way.)

This sounds like the technique used by the truck driver that ran me off
the road and into a rut that turned my wheel and subsequently broke two of
my ribs.  Surely his convenience was worth whatever pain and suffering I
had to endure.

So what makes a person this arrogant, violent, and hateful?  Does that
actually make anyone's life BETTER?

... Um, no thank you. Public trans brings a change in the political 
demographics of a region, diluting the opinion of the rural, mostly 
independent-minded (Linux?!?) folk by filling the area with people more 
dependent on government services. These people then vote to expand the role 
of municipal services at the expense of digging deeper in to the wallets & 
savings of the original denizens, who moved out here because we want and need 
fewer public services in the first place.

The other question is that I haven't heard of too many public trans projects 
which are wholly funded by the ridership alone. Therefore, such projects are 
dependent on grabbing some amount of revenue from people who don't use the 
service but just happen to live unfortunately close to the system. This is 
essentially relying upon a sort of theft - the locals who pay but don't use 
the system are being robbed, and for that they get an influx of transplants 
who don't understand the self-reliant culture: "Wanna go somewhere? Buy your 
own car." Also: Paying more money ( to private capitalist business or private 
person) to buy a 4x4 and mongo tires allows you to save tax money no longer 
needed for road maintenance (so you vote down the road repair levy.)  You are 
now more impervious to potholes & washouts, which themselves serve to screen 
out the wimp-mobiles. :-D

Almost on-topic: By contributing to the local private sector and starving the 
local public sector, isn't that the same as avoiding bloatware?

Oh, come on now.  You're mincing words.  Bicycles are not *regular*
traffic.  They are a rare form of traffic, at least as far as I see. 
Nowhere does it state you must be regular to be held by the same laws as
everybody else.  I am not regular in my use of computers - I use Linux. 
Should I then be not held to any of the same laws everybody else must
follow in regards to computing?

If a pedestrian is walking down the middle of the road, impeding
traffic, then guess what?  They *ARE* violating the law.  I don't think
most people consider pedestrian's shoes to be vehicles, either.  The law
did have the word vehicle in it, didn't it?

Ok, let me see if I can rephrase it.

Law A states motor vehicles can't do /this/.

Law B states bicycles are held to all the same laws as motor vehicles,
except those by their very nature they cannot or should not be expected
to follow.

Law A clearly doesn't include bicycles by itself.  Law B clearly
includes bicycles in laws written for motor vehicles.

Which law do you go by?  I'm no lawyer, but it sounds to me like the
judge got it wrong.

The law includes 'reason' in most everything.  You should try it.  :-)

Well, I really personally dislike both block parties and parades,
because they can (and do) fudge up traffic, although block parties tend
to be in residential areas where the traffic impact is minimal. 
Parades, on the other hand, I really dislike.

> What about Sunday drives in the country?

Sunday drives in the country don't have any effect on anybody, do they? 
Country roads are essentially never congested, although there are always
exceptions to this due to collisions or construction.  I don't see why
we need to include the exceptions in such a broad brush stroke, though.

> Kickball in the street?

It's a residential type thing, with minimal impact on traffic.  If the
little kids (assuming it's kids playing kickball, of course) don't get
out of the way for a vehicle with a need to use the street, though, I
would have a problem with it.

No, I don't think either law (and we're talking about two [reckless and
careless]- but I am not a lawyer) requires endangering the lives of
others.  A bicycle can do damage to a vehicle, or injure him(or
her)self, or cause the driver of one of the motorized vehicles to use
evasive action to not kill the bicycle rider and do damage to another
vehicle and its driver and passengers.

I think all of these things would fall under reckless driving, assuming
you can prove reckless intent... but I really don't think that would be
a problem for most DAs.  If you didn't think you could show intent in a
situation like that, you would have to go for a careless driving
citation, which has no intent requirement.  It is also an infraction,
instead of whatever reckless driving is (either a misdemeanor or a
felony - I'm pretty sure it's just a misdemeanor, though).

Both vehicles were applying force, and the bicycle was the one causing

Wow - how is that?  Everybody live where they work?  Naw, I really think

lol.

I don't live in the suburbs, I live further out than that.  I do most of
my work within walking distance of home, although I attend school up in
Portland.  I definitely don't spend 25% of my money on transportation
(have you seen my car?  lol).  My car is parked on the street.  The
garage is half-full of boxes, it's a storage room right now.  We
essentially paid for our street directly, and when I park at PSU, I pay
over $100 a term for a parking spot that isn't guaranteed to be there.

It is in our genes to transform our frustration into punishing others.
Spammers are frustrated at getting their ads to the few that actually
want the stuff.  They punish the rest of us.  We are frustrated about spam,
and can't find the spammers, so we punish the Direct Mail Association.
Jeme is frustrated at automobiles, and his inability to convince most
drivers to join him in bicycling - so he approves of measures like
Critical Mass.  Drivers, who think these particular cyclists are
self-deluding punishment-spreading jerks, then incorrectly punish
other cyclists by running them off the road.  (BTW, I fully expect
one of these drivers to go into roadrage mode, and drive through a
Critical Mass crowd at 80 miles an hour, killing himself and about
10 of the C.M. participants.  Resulting in legislation that would
severely restrict bicycling in ways completely irrelevant to managing
Critical Mass demonstrations.  Legislators are jerks, too).

Myself, I feel rage towards spammers, and rage towards closed-source
monopolists who create laws restricting competition against them.  I
got a chuckle out of the "use the spammers against themselves" trick
that started this argument going.  But punishment doesn't solve the 
problem, and it makes the world a more painful place.  Ask yourself
whether you would be a better person if your life was more painful.
If the answer is no, then extrapolate to the rest of the human race.
If the answer is yes, find a dominatrix and seek your bliss in a more
private way, thanks.

The Linux community, as a whole and by individual example, teaches a
better way.  We convert the frustration against Microsoft into advocacy
for Linux.  We don't picket Microsoft headquarters, we pass out Knoppix
disks.  We don't piss and moan about bugs, we fix them.  And although
we are a little late to the party about creating quality user apps, open
source apps are getting better at a rate that Microsoft cannot match.  
Fellows like Dan run Linux clinics for newbies, Dave and Zot set up
lectures to continue the education, and almost everyone here devotes
significant efforts to helping each other.  You can't buy that in a 
box from Microsoft, and in time no one will try.  We have the good
aspects of human nature on our side, we have sociality and conviviality,
and if we can remain true to these positives we cannot lose.

Those plagued by Spam may be forgetting the early days of Usenet,
when the groups were often clogged with classified ads by individuals
peddling their old stuff.  Oh, how the debates raged over what
constituted "commercial" versus "non-commercial" ads;  we were mostly
young communists [;-)] then, and Usenet was mostly transported over the
"not-for-commercial-use" Arpanet, so we felt we had a right to attack
folks who tried to sell commercially with ads in Usenet.  Personal ads
were all right "of course" (Why "of course"?).  

People don't do a lot of personal ads on lists anymore - at least not
in proportion to the vastly larger number of users out there.  The 
reason?  Ebay!  There is a much better outlet for peddling old stuff,
and now probably the only reason Ebay doesn't do *all* the garage sale
stuff in the world is that most people still don't know how.  The only
reason stuff still gets peddled in this group (and it seems to be rare)
is affinity;  we would rather sell our precious stuff to help our friends,
and we would rather buy from our friends.

I think there is a lesson for spam, here.  Some may smirk and go hmph
(you get a lot of that from the young and shallow) but there is a
business opportunity here - not as big as Ebay perhaps, but there.
Creating a market that efficiently links the peddlers of "legitimate"
spam products and consumers will dry up the revenue that drives that
kind of spam.  Educating email users in an entertaining way about the
various kinds of spam fraud should reduce the success of the 419 stuff. 
Developing better businesses for clever internet-savvy Africans (and
others) will make computer fraud a less attractive option.  Spam is a
symptom of a slightly broken economy, and as cheap as Spam is to send
out, there are better ways to move that information to the customers
that want it.  Spam is a "cry for help", a demonstration of unmet needs,
and many of those needs have a technological or business solution,
ripe for smart folks like us to get rich solving.

There may be some technological or business solutions for Jeme's desire
to make the world more bike friendly, too.  There are a lot of things
you can do on a bike that you can't do in a car, like stop and smell
the roses.  Or log in at a sidewalk kiosk.  Or stop and talk to people
without blocking traffic.  Create enough advantages for bicycling, and
being slow and wet and tired and bumper-bait won't seem quite so
offputting.  Cycling proponents argue the negatives ("It's cleaner!
You won't die as soon of a heart attack!  It's anti-corporate!") and
forget the lesson we are slowly learning with Linux - sell solutions,
not complaints.  Serve people, don't thwart or punish them. 

I'm looking out at the cold, wet rain right now, and thinking about a
book I want from the Tigard library 5 miles south, and a couple of checks
I want to put in my bank 2 miles west.  Absurd as it might sound to Jeme,
I am thinking "car" and not "bike".  In June, on a 75 degree sunshiny
day, Jeme and the bike win.  In a fully open source world, both those
infotransactions happen over the net, and I get immediate gratification.
With a fully developed net, I need neither bike nor car, ceding the roads
to those still willing to do battle on them.  If Jeme or others want my car
off the road, there are opportunities to provide me with better options. 
Gratitude and remuneration await those who prefer helping to punishment.

[and Jeme, I don't want the above to seem like I am picking on you (well,

If you honestly believe that, then you have a ways to go in your study
of humanity.

There are some extreme problems with the CM philosophy.  First, by
clogging the roads, they slow down the petroleum-fed vehicles, bringing
them, often, to a complete stop.  I don't believe any CM rider will
argue they don't slow down traffic.  Since they know they do it, and do
it over and over again, we must assume it is intentional.

Slowing down traffic, forcing traffic to stop, causes the cars to sit
there idling.  That wastes gasoline (or diesel) and forces more
pollutants into the air.  Isn't that contrary to the values of the
average CM rider?  Don't many of them ride their bikes specifically to
help keep the air just that much cleaner?  They're causing more
petroleum bi-products to be released into the atmosphere than if they
would have just gone home for the day.

Another substantial problem is you state they believe they are spreading
joy, beckoning others to join them on their bicycles.  Gee, I have a
picture in my head of people frolicking in a field, kinda like the
XP-default desktop field, maybe.

CM riders *piss people off*.  They ride their bicycles to block traffic,
eating the time of regular commuters.  You will never win somebody over
to your way of thinking if your most visible method is offensive to
everybody you're trying to win over.  If I argued for reduced
governmental gun control by pulling out my .22 pistol and firing it at
3AM just off the property of every state representative's residence who
lived outside of a city limits, waking them up, I think I would find I
wouldn't be winning them over to my side, now would I?

Or maybe I could borrow my friend's blank-firing pistol and go outside
the capital building and start firing it.  I'm sure that would win them
over to my side, right?

Wrong.

It makes absolutely no sense at all.

For one, the headline calls him "Leader of the Free World" and the article
goes on to say he's "benevolent dictator of Planet Linux, the largest
collaborative project in history".  I'd hardly call the kernel the largest
collaborative project in history.  If you wanted to call ONE project the
largest, it would probably be the GNU project.  And that DOES have a
leader.

As for your contention that someone who runs something must be the leader,
I would say perhaps no.  A leader leads.  A leader provides vision and
direction.  It is very possible for someone to have nominal or even real
control over a project, but not be the most active visionary or director
of the project.  That person would run the project without being the
leader.

Go for it - most of us who drive SUVs can afford it.  Of course, you'd
then be punishing those with older SUVs who have a real use for such a
vehicle.  Meals on wheels, maybe?

People seem to respond more to that line than to any others.  Hit a
nerve, did I?

It gets close to 17MPG, thankyouverymuch.

And it's less than seven feet wide, including the mirrors.  A lane isn't
supposed to be less than eight feet wide, at the absolute narrowest. 
Most lanes are far wider than that, at at least 12 feet in width.

I think I'll be in good company in your killfile.  :-)

Absolutely not.  I think Portland has one of the best transportation

irrelevant.

I take 20th for most trips on the east side.  Works pretty darn well.  If
I need to go south of Powell, I'll take the Springwater trail.

I don't ever have to go north-south on the west side outside of a few
blocks downtown.  Thankfully, I almost never have to go west of NW/SW
15th.

You shouldn't be driving to these places.  They are common transit points
and should be approached via mass transit.

The city is ringed with Park And Ride lots for folks that cannot
comfortably reach mass transit from their homes.  But if your daily
business requires you to use the Park And Ride lots, you should probably
reconsider your living situation.

PSU should never add any parking.  It is downtown.

> They really need to spread out more.

Excuse me?  Have you seen Atlanta, Los Angeles or Seattle lately?

Spreading out does NOTHING to decrease traffic congestion or improve
travel times.  It DOES, however, increase the total number of automobile
trips per day by separating people from their destinations and like
businesses from each other.

You're not looking.  Go downtown and sit at an intersection and see how
many bicycles pass that one intersection every hour.

You are a regular computer user and all computer users (regular or
otherwise) should be held to the same laws.

But if the law prohibits the use of a Graphical Interface System (and goes
on to define that) for a particular purpose, you shouldn't be held to that
law if you don't use a Graphical Interface System.  This is the case with
the law against impeding traffic.  It only applies to motor vehicles.  The
code is very clear and makes that distinction from section to subsection.

Sometimes they are and sometimes they're not.  It depends on the other
circumstances and conditions of the roads, sidewalks, and adjoining land.

That's NOT what the law says.  It says that a bicycle is a VEHICLE for all
sections of the code except where the code cannot apply.  It is not a
MOTOR VEHICLE.

That's not what Law B (ORS 814.400) says.

Actually, intent is NOT a consideration when forming law.  Intent is part
of the Congressional Record when law is written, but the court rarely
listens to arguments of legal intent and judges merely on application.

That's why you can't challenge a law in court without a pending case under
that law.

Well, you did write that using the road for a purpose other than getting
form Point A to Point B is "disgusting".

So automobiles are the #1 priority in appropriating public space in a
city?  That's kind of fucked up.  Automobiles are just one little tool in
the great attempt to improve life for humanity.

811.135 Careless driving; penalty. (1) A person commits the offense of
careless driving if the person drives any vehicle upon a highway or other
premises described in this section in a manner that endangers or would be
likely to endanger any person or property.

811.140 Reckless driving; penalty. (1) A person commits the offense of
reckless driving if the person recklessly drives a vehicle upon a highway
or other premises described in this section in a manner that endangers the
safety of persons or property.

Personally, I'd saw the weapon is wielded by the driver.  If a person is
walking around with a cocked and loaded gun and his finger on the trigger,
I'd hardly blame the schmoe who bumped into him for the bullet in the
third guy's head.  Dig?

Pushing anything weighing more than a thousand pounds around at speeds
greater than 20mph in a public place is reckless endangerment in my book.

ORS 161.085 (9) "Recklessly," when used with respect to a result or to a
circumstance described by a statute defining an offense, means that a
person is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and
unjustifiable risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance
exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof
constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable
person would observe in the situation.

A reasonable person would, to me, calculate the forces involved in moving
heavy shit around at high speeds and the relevant impact of those forces
on a human body and observe enough caution to reduce those forces to
sub-lethal levels.

Careless driving is a traffic violation and reckless driving is a
misdemeanor.  However, if you cause an accident with either, you can be
charged with further penalties.

What's "the problem"?  To me, the problem would be someone dying or
seriously injured.  In an auto/bicycle collision, the cause of that
problem would surely be the automobile.

Do you have some other definition of "the problem"?

There are no trees under the Burnside Bridge, that I recall.  And you're
further presupposing that it's someone's intent to "disrupt rush hour
traffic as much as they can".

And if you don't have the energy to ride a bicycle a few miles after a
day's work, I think you have serious health problems that should be
addressed.

Then don't work in a city.  Your lifestyle is a whole system.  If you

Gas, insurance, etc.  25% is an average for the least wealthy 80% of the
public.

So you use publicly subsidized storage for your private property?

That's still massively subsidized.

The actual cost of automobile operation is staggering.  Something on the
order of several dollars per mile.  Most of this is picked up by the
people, collectively, through their public agencies.

Message-ID: <3F8DC0AC.1050200@pobox.com>

Can anyone recommend a reasonably priced hosting company for a 
JSP/Tomcat site?  JSP/Tomcat support and at least one MySQL database are 
mandatory for my needs.  Any reasonable amount of disk space and 
bandwidth will probably suit my needs for the time being.  I only really 
need one email account, but several would be nice.  I also might need at 
least one add-on domain, but could work around that if I had to.  A ssh 
account would be most preferable and it would be nice if the server was 
running some distribution of Linux (I run Red Hat 7.3 and 9.0).  I have 
found a couple of hosting companies (Alden, Java Servlet Hosting, and 
Java Pie) but have never worked with any of them.  I'm looking to keep 
my costs under $15 or maybe $20 per month for decent reliable services. 
 After a year I will probably be able to upgrade .

Any recommendations?

Jeezum, crow.  I can't believe you have such a poor understanding of the
interconnectedness of all things and the tight weave of the social fabric.

You mean the rural, mostly simple-minded folk without the sophistication

I'm not sayin' I believe that, but it's about as valid as your absurd
generalization.

I don't think there's any evidence at all that public transit increases
the population of the area served by public transit.

And few people are more dependent on government services than users of
private gasoline-powered automobiles on public roads and highways.

Do you understand how those services benefit people who don't directly use
them or is that kind of thing beyond you?

There isn't any such thing as PRIVATE transportation projects that are
wholly funded by the ridership alone.

You cannot operate transportation at user expense.  Every transportation
system is massively subsidized by the public.

Modern transportation is prohibitively expensive on the individual level.
But it is deemed important enough to be supported by the population acting
collectively.  Now, some might say it is deemed important BY the people
and others might say it is deemed important by the folks on the receiving
end of those public funds.  I think it's perhaps too complex for a certain
answer.

Again, the social fabric is woven from many individuals working in their
own way to achieve common goals and the aggregate goal of increased
quality of life through peace, love, and understanding (being the only
ideals a group can hold that do not cause interpersonal friction and
strife).

> - the locals who pay but don't use the system are being robbed,

These systems allow a low cost of living for the poor who provide services
for everyone else in society at very low wages (thus decreasing the end
cost of those services).

It is currently impossible to remove one's self from that system except
for possibly by foresaking all modern convenience and the benefits of
civilization and society.

Do you need a reminder of how many public subsidies go into the production
of automobiles, roads, and gasoline?

Could those monster trucks and tires be produced without properly

One cannot be more or less impervious.  It is an absolute.

No, it's the same as encouraging rape, murder, and starvation.

Why wouldn't I believe that?  I'm smiling when I ride.  The folks around

and clapping.  Some motorists wave and smile.

That is joy.

I think you should state what you think "the CM philosophy" is before you

The fact is that there is NO CM philosophy.  It's just a bunch of people
riding bicycles.

I would argue that CM does not slow down traffic.  I've been arguing it
with Russell for two days (or haven't you been reading?).

Rush hour is MUCH slower than bicycles.

Most of the joy is spread by handing out candy and pamphlets, telling

They piss of some people.  Mostly it's people who are looking to blame

Your assumptions are wrong and so the conclusions make no sense at all.

That shouldn't be surprising.

It's a lethal threat.  You're provoking all kinds of pent up rage in
people.  That kind of driving style is what brings the guns out in LA and
makes the drivers run down the cyclists all over the country.

I would take it lightly if that kind of behavior wasn't REAL and a danger
to people's lives every day.

I've been run off the road by angry drivers.  I was seriously injured in
the process.

I know people who have been purposely run down.  Some people are killed
that way.

It's not a joke, really.  The steam these people are blowing off is their
frustration with a broken system of their own invention.

He wasn't anywhere near the first in the Free World.  In fact, he is a
fair late-comer to the idea of public collaboration and still has a pretty
loose idea of what it means to be Free.

And please, please, edit your headers.  I don't need two copies of every
response you write to one of my posts and neither does anyone else on the
list.  It takes two seconds and makes things nicer for other people.

There was no satire in this thread.  Guy's stuff was NOT satire, it was
jokes thinly veiling threats.  They're supposed to be funny because the
people who "get it" really do want to do those things and empathize with
the rage and violence.

That's not what satire is and that's not funny.

You should look up satire.  It's a whole different kind of humor.

That's why there's a two or three block long blank space in front of CM

JFC Jeme, he was the first one to write the Linux kernel. 

Are you arguing just to argue?

OK, the second definition of satire:

trenchant wit, irony, or sarcasm used to expose and discredit vice or
folly

In my book, it fits. It's called SARCASM. 

Oh, and I found the keystroke to stop annoying you with dupes.

Because they think no one will listen to them. Better to be annoying than 
ignored, I guess. Especially you, Jeme, for all your blathering about 
community, you sure have a hard time following simple community rules, like 
which list to post on.

Timo has some interesting ideas on spam control, including a roll-your-own

Saying something is off-topic is off-topic in itself.  Just like

Actually, I've found that killfiling all Debian users leads to a marked
increase in signal-to-noise ratio.

Sounds like your initrd-<kernel version>.img does not have the pcmcia
modules in it.  After installing the new kernel, run mkinitrd
/boot/initrd-<new kernel-version>.img <new kernel-version>.  This should
pickup all the modules you need to get started.  The generic initial ram
disk may not have the laptop modules in it.

Yes, I could. However, the real answer was the ',L' command in mutt, or to use sylpheed. Unfortunately, running X apps over the network to my Windows box at work is usually slow. So I use mutt at work, and sylpheed at home.

Well, just to bring everyone up to date:

I replaced the motherboard (with a nearly identical D845GEBV2), but
have the same basic problem.  This time, and actually the last several
times with the first motherboard, no video, no beeps, fans spin up, a
little LED goes on on the motherboard, link lights on the RJ45
connector go on, keyboard LED's flash, but no beeps.  Basically,
indistinguishable behavior between first motherboard and second
motherboard.  All power connections are made, including the little
4-pin P4 power connector.  When I remove all the memory and power up,
it beeps several (three?) times.  I've tried a different power supply
and get indistinguishable behavior.  The memory and CPU were purchased
new.  The memory, 2 sticks of CT6464Z335 from crucial (selected using
their little motherboard compatibility webapp thingie).  Tried one at
a time.  No workie.

I am down to two possibilities: bad CPU or bad memory.  Before I go
off and do battle with the vendors, I'd really like to narrow it down.
Is there likely to be a 478-pin P4 and/or compatible 184-pin DDR
memory at the clinic this weekend that I could test in the box to try
to triangulate on the faulty part?

Subject: [PLUG] DSL Modem & QWEST
Message-ID: <200310160735.39756.guy1656@ados.com>

Greetings:

I was informed by mail that DSL is now available in my area.

QWEST offers a device called an Actiontec 1520, but surfing blogs & install 
woes sites, seems to indicate that that unit is rather buggy.

I currrently have a gateway cpu, a second computer behind it for my job. If we 
get this working, my wife may be able to telecommute a few days a week, but 
her place is an MS-only shop, and she would be using VPN.

So, does it sound like we are talking a heterogenious network of Linux and 
Win? I live between St. Helens & Scappoose, and whatever system I use pretty 
much has to be rock-solid stable. I already have my own job, which means I 
won't have much bandwidth to learn to 'administer' the new device  on top of 
that. I have to learn enough job-related things within my own field to keep 
current as is. I have no experience in managing routers, or switches, so I'm 
looking for something that needs as much attention as a typical TV set - lots 
of complex circuitry inside, sure, BUT the user interface is simple. Turn it 
on/off, plug things into it (like a VCR, DVD or game player) and these things 
work, without having to call for tech support or buy & read 3 five-pound 'In 
a Nutshell' books ...

What sort of hardware would plug into the wall (RJ-11 telephone socket) and 
provide one or more Cat-5 plugs for the Linux computers and an open Cat-5 
plug so if my wife jacks he laptop into that port, then she can VPN in Win 
simultaneously as I do e-mails 'n' stuff in Linux?

Also, comments on a Cysco 678?

That mostly goes with DSL in general.  POTS doesn't have the bandwidth
to support reliable high speed connections over very much distance,
and DSL providers generally tend to use some nasty hacks to screw you
out of the service you're paying for, like PPPoE.  Comcast sucks, but
it's better than Qwest.

Except that DSL at least allows you to choose a back-end provider, so
you can get the TOS you need. I'm hoping it'll happen in Comcast land
soon -- the courts have told a reluctant FCC that cable should be
treated like DSL when it comes to broadband offerings -- but I'm not
holding my breath.

True enough.

Is your experience with DSL really that bad? I host my personal web
and mail on a friend's Qwest-provided DSL line, and the uptime has
been quite good.

I suppose the quality of the local copper varies significantly from
location to location.

I did tech support for Qwest working for $shithole-outsource-place.
Qwest's own technical opinion of DSL is lower than that of mine.  I'm
under NDA, but it should tell you something when the telco thinks DSL
is a sham.  Working at the same place, I did tech support for @Home.
Even though both the cable company and the telco outsource their
support, at the cable company's got way more people taking calls and a
lot fewer people calling in.

I bought one of these after my Qwest-provided Cisco 678 died shortly
after the warrenty expired.

I've not had any major problems with the Actiontec, though I did
initially have to talk to Qwest tech support to get it working
correctly.

In my basement, the WAN port port on the Actiontec plugs in to the phone
jack via RJ-11. Be sure to use filters on all telephones that use this
same phone line.

The ethernet port on the Actiontec is plugged in to the external ethernet
on my Linux firewall, and the internal ethernet on the firewall plugs in
to a small 8-port ethernet switch. I have Winders, Linux, and
occasionally BSD, Solaris, & whatever plugged into the switch, along
with an 802.11b wireless bridge. I do NAT on the firewall, so everything
on the switch uses RFC 1918 private addressing.

At work, we have a Cisco VPN concentrator, and the Windows vpn client
connects to it fine going through NAT & the firewall. I've also set up a
LAN to LAN vpn to the concentrator using FreeSWAN on the firewall.

> Also, comments on a Cysco 678?

It worked great until it died. :( Cisco also discontinued them, and have
pretty well abandoned the lowest-priced CPE market.

At the suggestion of Alan and others at Advanced Topics last night,
I have modified my Knoppix CD labels.  They can be downloaded from:

   http://www.keithl.com/knoppix33.ps
   http://www.keithl.com/knoppix33.pdf

In addition to all the other masses of text, they also contain in very
small type:

   Dr. Knopper's MAGIC PC Soap!  100% Cruelty Free!
   Encrypt! Encrypt! OK!
   All-Gnu! All-One!

These are "stomper" format, but it is hand-edited postscript and label
centers are easily moved for other formats.


I was thinking we could mass produce a thousand or so of these disks,
and give them to homeless folk to sell on downtown street corners for
a buck.  We could call them "Street Boots". :-)

I think this is clearly dependent on location and luck.  With my personal
sample of one, I've had Aracnet and Qwest DSL for close to four years
with nary a problem.  Being able to choose my ISP is very important to
me.  I won't consider Comcast until they allow alternate ISPs.

What good is reliability if you can't get TOS?

And besides, of my last five outages all were on my cable connection,
not my DSL.  So maybe rephrase: what good is _cable_ if you can't get
reliability _OR_ TOS?  Basically, one thing: download speed.

I had Speakeasy over Covad for a year (then moved out of DSL range) and the 
service was excellent.  There were two times when I had outages of over a few 
minutes.  One time was when Qwest opened the box at the end of the street and 
crossed a wire (I lost the other phone line then too).  The other time was 
when a router near the DSLAM went into the big bit bucket in the sky.

Speakeasy was not cheap (I had SDSL), but I always found the service to be 
excellent.  When I had a routing problem (they didn't filter traceroute 
packets like Comcast seems to be doing), I could call tech support and email 
them a traceroute trace and they'd look at it while we were on the phone.  
Tech support that knew something!  I got followups on my problem reports 
within a few hours and usually another about 24 hours after the problem was 
fixed making sure the problem was really fixed.

Now, I've got Comcast and the service is not great.  At least the hour-long 
outages in the middle of the day seem to be gone.  Comcast's DNS is flaky, 
and getting email through their servers is difficult at best.  My download 
rate is consistently around 220kB/s, so I really cannot complain much about 
that.  Upload is not pretty though.

Best,
Kyle

  I'll add one more datum. When I lived in NE Portland the wire from the CO
to the old house in which I lived was poor and the internal wiring even
worse. This was on dial-up and the connections were unreliable.

  Out here in the windy east, I've had GTE/Verizon dsl since 1 June 1999
with Aracnet (now SpiritOne) as my ISP. In the first couple of years the
GTE/Verizon techs were here about three times: once to replace the 'modem',
twice to tune it and futz with the outside wiring. For the past couple of
years I've had no outages (but someone ran into a telephone pole a couple of
weeks ago and took out electrical power to almost 7,000 of us.

I don't have much time to waste on getting this thing up & running fast and

1 beer. That's my impression. Maybe I'm wrong.

But my question is, what's this gonna be like? I can get the physical

When I next turn on the machine, I'll be thinking "WHAT DO I DO?" (all the

I like that DSL gives you a choice of ISPs. Over the past few years, I've had 
clients on both Verizon and Qwest DSL, and for the most part it's worked 
fine. This is mainly in the Hillsboro- West side area, that might make a 
difference, with newer infrastructure. 

If a client wants to run an important Web site over their DSL, I try to talk 
them out of it. Web hosting services are cheap, and a lot less hassle. 
(Page-zone, Affordable Host, Citadelhost, One World Hosting are all good 
budget hosts) Of course this is for ordinary people, not uber geeks like 
Heinlein. :)

  My "bronze-plus" DSL package probably is much slower on downloads than the
speeds you cable subscribers see. However, there's another factor at work
here: what's going on at the other end.

  I'm reminded of this as I have spent the last few hours downloading
environmental impact statements, technical appendices and other docs --
about 75M in all -- from the Walla Walla District of the Corps of Engineers.
Download speed tops out at 18 kbps and is as low as 9 kbps. It must be the
stiff wind blowing from the west that holds back them bits, but I'm sure the
problem is far from the CO nearest to me.

I suggest taking the time to learn. Prevention is a lot cheaper. Unless you

The easiest way to share a broadband connection is use something like one of 
those little Linksys boxes, 
http://linksys.com/products/group.asp?grid=34&scid=29. If you're not running 
any public services, it's pretty secure. Properly configured, of course. 
Linksys has all kinds of good howto docs, that might be a good starting 
point.

Okay, more procmail/spamassisin confusion.  After reading all the

spamassisin working as it should, but I cannot figure out how to get the
spam to go to a "caughtspam" folder.  I have a /etc/procmail file as
follows:

And, I tried putting a .procmailrc file in my home directory but the
spam still comes to my INBOX.  Its obvious that the rc file is wrong bec
the logs call it suspicious.  I think I followed the docs but it still
does not work the way I want it to.

  /usr/sbin/traceroute. Read all about it: 'man traceroute'. Works on
dial-up, too.

  Two items here:

  1) Build yourself a floppyfw firewall box on the least expensive hardware
you can find (old 386 with 16M RAM, video card, keyboard, two NICs and a
floppy drive is all you need) or buy a firewall appliance. Very, very
important. Do not stand naked on the 'Net; you'll be attacked and ravished
very quickly.

  2) Between your firewall and the working computers put a 4-port switch
(faster than a hub). You can plug in both your computer and your wife's
computer and each of you works independently on the dsl line.

The ITEC show is December 10-11 at the Oregon Convention

David Mandel and I have discussed PLUG's participation
in the pavilion and theater and we've assured one
another that PLUG is interested in participating, is
welcome to participate, is on an equal footing with the
other two user groups, and that we'll all cooperate to
make the event successful.

There are numerous opportunities for you to help. One of
you can help immediately by setting up a mailing list
and/or wiki so we can communicate and coordinate. If you
do, please use "itek" in the address and not "plug".

Once the mailing list or wiki is up, I can outline what

Have you looked into alternative carriers?  I use Speakeasy and don't have
to directly deal with Qwest at all.  (It's not even clear how much of my
line is managed by Qwest.  Probably just the termination equipment and the
last-mile copper, but very little of the maintenance.)

You definitely want some kind of firewall/gateway machine, probably doing
HAT (Host Address Translation).  If you go with such a solution (which
everyone here would surely recommend), you're going to need a firewall
device that can tunnel or pass the VPN bits.  That could be a simple DC
powered thingie that is small and silent and sucks very little power
(though I don't know which models from which manufacturers support which
VPN protocol) or it could be a low-powered PC (I use a 486/50 with 16MB
RAM) with a properly configured kernel and iptables (floppyfw will do it
handily -- no hard disk required).

Though I've already deleted the message, I recall that one of
you was concerned about DSL or cable reliability because you
run a server. One solution is for two or more of you in the
same situation to host each other's services. For example,
each of you can host the others' content on your web
server. If your connection fails, people can get to you via
the other location(s).

Try adding something like this:
:0H
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
/wherever/caughtspam/

That checks the new header, and puts it into the spam bucket. By
default, procmail will deliver the mail if there's some kind of error.

I haven't done the research you, but I have installed these for 
customers, one in St. Helens and one in Longview.  No problems with either 
and they've been in service over a year now.  Both are terminated with 
Linux based firewall.  The 1520 can act as either a router or a bridge 
depending on if you have purchased a static ip.

Just a note about VPN, performance can be quite disappointing.  I believe 
this mainly to be due to the "upload" speed with the DSL service.

I'd go with the recommendation a firewall appliciance such as one from 
Linksys, D-link, or the myriad of others on the market.  Actually, the 
1520 does have some firewalling capability (port blocking mostly) but I 
don't think I rely on it alone.

If you use a firewall appliance, some come with 4 or more ports on the 
inside or trusted interface. In effect they are also an ethernet 
switch/hub.  But you can always plug another hub to increase the port 
count.

Never seen one afore.  I assume you meant Cisco.

Okay, spamassassin is putting the spam in a folder nicely, but now how
do I get the bayesian filter to parse that folder?  I try sa-learn
--spam /directory_of_spam_mbox, but I get things like 0 messages
read even though the spam is in there.  Is there a way to add a
feature to evolution that allows me to right click or something
and tag a message that is more than just suspicious as actual 
spam?  Do I have to receive a 1000 spams or so before
the bayesian filter kicks in?  It seems like if the certainty
something is spam is high enough like this isn't an Outlook
message even though someone is trying to pass it off as one
that that message should never be delivered.

Is there an easy way to blacklist all destinations from my mail
site with a whitelist of just the people I know I should be sending
to?  It would be nice to have a temporary whitelist feature.
I'm concerned some emails I get may be trying to phone home.

All,

Scott Kveton, Unix Systems Administrator for Oregon State University,
made the front page of the Gazette Times this morning for his efforts in
hosting the Mozilla web browser!

http://www.gazettetimes.com/articles/2003/10/16/news/community/thu03.txt

Here's a great quip by Scott in the article:

"It's a very busy server right now. I can tell you right now we're
putting out 120 megabytes a second ? which might impress some people,"
Kveton said."

And this...

"We use open source ? not exclusively, but heavily. Our entire e-mail
infrastructure and all of our anti-spam software has been run by
open-source software for the last year. It's reduced spam and viruses, I
would say, about 40 percent for the entire campus. It's been a huge win
for us, and it's all been free to use!" 

Way to go Scott!

I had exactly this problem. Looking at the file it turned out in my case
to be the way Exchange was munging the headers (very non-standard, for
sure). The solution is to "prep" the file before you process it with
SpamAssassin:


  $formail -ds < $reported_spam_file >> $tmp_reported_spam_file
  sa-learn --ham --mbox $tmp_reported_good_file

There's a lot of variables there (I like to do it this way to make it
easy for people after me to change the file locations if they need to).
Here's a "concrete" example:

  formail -ds < /var/spool/mail/spam >> /tmp/reported_spam
  sa-learn --spam --mbox /tmp/reported spam

Repeat in a similar fashion for the reported "good" mail, stir, and
serve on a warm plate!

OK - let's have that beer first to just take a moment to relax.  Let's make
it simple and sweet - later you can do all of that fancy stuff. You just
want something that works, right?

Any service to your home will go down occasionally.  It's the ease of
recovery that is important. DSL reliability is a function of the local
copper and how many times a month some technician is  messing with the wire.
The same is true of cable but in my past experience cable's reliability as
an ISP is worse than the QWEST and choice of ISP solution with DSL (I use
EasyStreet - saving $5 per month on the cheapest ISP never appealed to me -
EasyStreet is commercial business class service, and they are local).

Setting up DSL is easy ...

1) Plug in microfilters (in-line cigar sized passive devices) into each
phone wire that shares the phone line that your DSL modem will be connected
to. QWEST will sent these to you when you sign up.  Total time - 2 minutes.

2) From the RJ-11 phone jack plug into the DSL modem.  I would strongly
suggest an external modem, not a card in a PC.  The external box can always
be on and is one less complex thing (like a PC with an internal card) to
fail or lock up.  Virtually all DSL modems have no or very little
configuration - you just plug them in and go. Watch the lights on the modem
- after it powers on the WAN (external to QWEST) light should flash while
the modem trains - this is kind of like the tone handshaking that you used
to do when you dialed out.  It will come on solid and you are connected to
the real world via DSL!  Total time 2 minutes.

3) Plug cable from the Ethernet modem into a Router (<$100 LinkSys is great
with 4-8 ports - you can get them with wireless 802.11 if you like, too).
Plug your computer's ethernet into the router.  Jump into the Network
control panel and set your IP to be DHCP, and the gateway to be the IP
assigned by the router manufacturer (read the manual - likely it's
192.168.0.1).  Use the browser on your computer to connect to the router by
typing in the IP, enter the external WAN IP that QWEST sent you into the
right box.  You're good to go.  Total time <5 minutes.
You should come back to this router config step and make sure that the ports
are all closed except those you are using (SMTP=25, if you have servers open
www=80, and POP=110).  You might need others for the VPN.

4) Connect other computers to the router and make sure that their IP is
assigned by the router (DHCP).  Total time per computer <2 minutes.

I know little about VPN's.  You might need a special port open and perhaps
some special hardware that you plug into the router between the computer and
the router.

When things go wrong (this is what I have my wife do).  Usually it's an
email failure.  I ask her if a web page can load.  If not I ask her if the
WAN and LAN lights are flashing (if not unplug and replug the DSL modem).
At this point its a quick call to the ISP to see that all is well on their
end. They can see up the line all the way to your DSL modem and you don't
need to know anything about trace routes. Usually you are not the first to
report a regional outage but sometimes they ask me to call QWEST. Usually
its a short DSL outage and everything comes back up OK.  Very occasionally I
have to unplug the DSL modem for a few seconds and plug it back in - just
because - it's kind of like a blue screen fatal error thing - it just
happens).

It's really not very complicated to set up or maintain.

fwiw, 

I went through something very similar to this a couple of days ago. On
power up, the fans would spin, but no beeps, no post, no video. For some
reason taking the memory out at least made it beep. The problem was the
CPU. This behavior was identical wether it was the broken CPU (that I
had just purchased) or when trying a CPU from another machine that was
known _not_ to work with the motherboard. 

As well, in the past I had trouble getting a machine to POST and it
turned out to be that the motherboard bios default settings required the
cpu fan connected and running. I think what I had was a cpu fan that was
working but not connected to the "cpu fan" MB connector. In the bios,
there was a way to disable this safety feature. But how to get to the
bios in the first place? Well, in a very small font on some obscure page
of the motherboard manual, it mentioned that you could cirumvent this
feature by holding down the SHIFT key (or something) on boot.

Hope this helps.

Has anyone gotten the Cisco DSL 504 or the model that will be used in
St. Helens to work under Linux without bridging it?  

I guess if you do that you have to let the router control your network
numbering and perhaps the firewall also.  On the other hand, I think 
the only way to reprogram the 504 is through the serial port and
provided cable.  I suppose it could be left wide open as far as
firewalling where it could then be plugged into a router with 
a switch off it for the lan.  But MS-NAT and masquerading 
as far as I know are incompatible.  This becomes a problem 
on networks that already have a router/firewall where 
one ends up having to abandon that firewall/router 
and firewall every single workstation directly.

-----------         ------------
|         |         |          |   ----------                 /-------\
| DSL-504 |---------| Linux    |---| switch |-----6 lines-----|  LAN  |
|         |         | router/  |   ----------                 \-------/ 
-----------         | firewall |
                    |          |
                    ------------ 

The latter configuration without bridging should be 
possible.  The only difference with my subnet is a 
switch between the DSL-504 and Linux 
routers/firewalls.  If I were to go to a second 
line of DSL, I'd consider dropping the subnet.
Chances are I'd probably have to bridge twice 
though.  Bridging is $5/month where minimum you
lose an ip out of the Opus pool and end up paying
at least $5/month for one static one.

A little off topic...  I've asked for POTSless DSL,
but Opus says the phone company requires dialtone
where there are times CenturyTel will take one 
copper pair that appears to be unused to replace
another one that is broken or lossy, dialtone 
being the determinant of which lines can be 
used for the patch.  If they'd just keep track
of line use or use a DSL detector, there 
wouldn't be a problem.  Thing is, all the
lines coming to my place can't be used by
anyone else very easily without someone 
digging up the cable where I thought phone
companies tried to maintain clean runs to
a central box.

Do I need to keep the spam as it comes in to my folder or can I toss 
it?  Does anyone know how to completely erase spam instead of doing
a standard delete?  I believe the program is called wipe or 
something.

[michael at goose michael]$ sa-learn --ham evolution/local/Inbox/mbox
Learned from 0 message(s) (1 message(s) examined).

Now why does it say learned from zero messages?  Maybe it's
automatically building a database.

Yes, I do.  

After each spam message arrives, power down your computer.  Following
good ESD practices remove the hard disks from your computer, then go
to a clearing away from dry grass or brush, scrape the surface down to
a mineral soil in a 3 foot radius.  Place the drive on the ground,
pour a half-cup or so of thermite on top of the drive.  Taking proper
care, ignite the thermite, then stand well back while your spam is

It's probably not a good idea to erase spam completely, as opposed to
filtering it. Spamassassin will produce false positives as well as false
negatives. It would be wise to filter, and then review the filtered messages
before deleting. But if you have faith in Spamassassin, the method mentioned
below will work.

I'd agree with the assessment that any "important Web site" ought to
be hosted on a professionally managed network -- but it does beg the
question of what "important" means. Other questions present
themselves:

* can the site owner stand an hour or two of downtime now and then?

* is the site not terribly bandwidth-intensive?

* will the site owner promise never to post his/her URL on
  Slashdot? :-)

* does the site owner or his/her hired geek like doing the hands-on
  work of maintain the site's server?

* is the flexibility of adding more software options or bells/whistles
  more important than raw platform stability?

For those who answer "yes" to the above, then DSL might be
appropriate...

I did write that he'd have to have that much faith in SpamAssassin.

I know I don't... even though I've not yet received a false positive.

I have gotten a few.

Hotmail that contained only html would tag as spam.  I had someone on a 
mailing list who could never quite figure out how to fix that.

A couple of announce lists would trigger spam assassin.

Not much though.

I am seeing more an more spam get through as SpamAssassin collects white 
list data.

Subject: [PLUG] Re: Projector, configuration
Message-ID: <20031016223454.GA565@gate.kl-ic.com>

Yesterday I posted one of my long rambles about a "great opportunity
for computer projectors and Linux."

NOT!  There are tools coming into place to do this.  The reason Zot
has problems with his ancient 1993 Proxima is that it is too old to
have "DDC", Display Data channel, which is display configuration
data coming up pins 12 and 15 of the HD-15 cable.  DDC showed up
around 1994 or so.

So, sorry for the false alarm - there is no business here.  Sigh.

I did find something useful.  This is a page that should be posted near
every computer projector:

http://www.infocus.com/service/tech_library/laptop_chart.asp?site_lang=1&site_region=1&

This describes the key sequences to activate the external video port on
every laptop out there - hundreds of models by manufacturer.  With that,
and some XConfig frobbing, you should be able to get most projectors to
work.

---

On a related note:

I talked with Keith Packard a bit at Advanced Topics last night. 
KeithP is one of the principle designers of X-Windows.  He is currently
moving most of X functionality out of user space and into the kernel,
which Linus Torvalds likes but the BSD community hates.  Much fireworks
going on.  Is this a fork?  Who is the forker, and who is the forkee? 

Keith says his new code will be ready around the beginning of 2004,
is very small and fast (it recompiles on his laptop in about 10 seconds)
and will make things like laptop ACPI work great.  It will handle
projectors with different video formats just fine.

Message-ID: <3F8F2229.2050409@pobox.com>

I download a lot of large files and the server I get them from only has 
HTML downloads, so I use Mozilla to download them.  It is very busy most 
of the time and it disconnects me often, and then I start downloading 
those huge files all over again.  When I download from Windows using 
Internet Explorer it disconnets just as often.  But Windows apparently 
caches its partial downloads and remembers where it left off, because 
when I try to download the files again, it picks up where it left off, 
right in the middle of the file.  This saves huge amounts of time, but I 
spend most of my time logged into Linux, not Windows.  Does anyone know 
of an HTML browser or tool that runs on Linux that will do the same 
thing?  Or possibly a Mozilla setting that I have not found that will 
enable that feature?

A DSL modem/router, a firewall appliance and a network hub or switch.
Many firewalls have built-in network switches, saving a box.

So, it'd be like this:
computer -\
computer - switch -- firewall -- modem -- phone-line
computer -/

Most firewalls handle the VPN stuff OK.  You might want to check and see
if it's a PPTP, IPSec or some other sort of VPN, and then Google or
something to see if the firewall you're using handles it.

I've had good luck with the LinkSys BEFSR41, which has a built-in 4-port
switch. Just promise me, whatever firewall you get,
*don't forget to install the latest firmware upgrade.*

> Also, comments on a Cysco 678?

I have one left over from when I had QWest DSL, with Pacifier as my ISP.
Worked like a champ.

As for cable, well, I miss DSL.

Good luck,
  Aaron

Better preface that with a 'usually' ...  :-)

I'm stuck with Web-ster for my Internet connection.... the phone company
provides the DSL service, Web-ster the bandwidth (and ultimately AT&T
provides them their bandwidth).

Although, this means I get a static IP....

The bandwidth sucks, though... 512/256.

Que???!??  Is any of this appearing in any mailing lists? (other than this one 
of course).  It really seems like X is starting to implode.  Sigh.

Whoa!  This seems like a 180-degree turn for Linus.  He and his kernel 
henchmen have very consistently said that the more code in user space, the 
merrier.  Graphics was one of the examples they used.  DRI was not that 
popular with the kernel folks until the DRI people showed what was needed 
otherwise.  Things are put in the kernel only when there is a strong reason 
to do so.  See the removal of the in-kernel HTTP server.  It proved a point, 
but Apache has sped up a lot in the last couple of years and the need for 
such a server has diminished.

What exactly is Keith putting in the kernel?  I can see all the card-specific 
register frobbing maybe.  DRI has some security points that make it a little 
than exciting (from some things I've read, not personal experience).

(might need to replace DRI with DRM, it is the direct rendering 
interface/manager or something, _NOT_ digital rights mismanagement.)

I tend to agree with Linus' original position that this kind of stuff stays 
outside the kernel.

I also tend to think that the X-protocol has some very nice features and some 
really annoying problems.  I think it needs some deep reengineering, but keep 
some of the core concepts.  Networks are faster and processors are two or 
three orders of magnitude faster than what X started with.  That makes for 
different tradeoffs and makes some things really frustrating and some things 
possible that were not before.

Best,
Kyle

Just use 'poweroff'.

Top-posting is evil.  :-)

Is your .spamassassin/user_prefs (or whatever the config file is
called?) set up to make sense?

I think you could probably set it up so it doesn't add the necessary
header.

Maybe try enabling logging in procmail and see what is happening?

I think it's worth mentioning OSU is hosting Gentoo, as well.  Virtually
all the tarballs ebuilds go looking for can be found on
gentoo.oregonstate.edu - which is really a good resource if you're
looking for a tarball but don't know where the hosting site is.  :-)

They also have some tarballs of some CVS downloads - that is, CVS
converted into a tarball.

Good stuff.  :-)

Pick either APM or ACPI and implement it... 

I, personally, like ACPI, but APM is more tried-and-true.

IIRC, modprobe apm and maybe loading apmd (although I don't know that
that is required) allows the system to power itself down.

While poweroff or for that matter "shutdown -h now" will power the system
off, it still needs to be supported by the BIOS and after that the kernel.

If APM, then you need the apm modules loaded.  I forget what the APIC
equivalent might be.

Okay, now for the mundane questions- 
Does the desired file exist? Can the user that runs the procmail recipe
have permission to write to the directory? 
On my system, the directory I specified wrote three sub-directories,
new, tmp and cur. Can your user do that? 
What do the logs say? My /var/log/maillog has entries every time spamd
runs, and the /var/log/procmail.log has entries that tel me what it did
with each message. What do your logs tell you about those messages that
get delivered, and you do not want?

Please consider bottom-posting. it keeps conversations in a more logical
flow.

Have you resolved this?

Was auto-learn turned on? I accidentally turned it on once and then I
couldn't manually learn, it had already processed the message...

dittos on wget, it works like a charm. I just D/L 50 megs of complex

  I _thought_ apmd was running (on both the portable and the workstation),
but perhaps not. I had the impression that apm had something to do with it,
but I couldn't find where by reading the man page.

Konqueror incorporates Kget, which is a front-end to wget. So you get all the 
nice goodies of wget inside the browser.

Sorry, I didn't mean to be cryptic. instead of 'shutdown -h now', just type 
'poweroff', all by itself. See 'man poweroff' for all the gory details. :)

Subject: [PLUG] Working on backup web site...
Message-ID: <1066357268.27978.61.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

How does the backup of http://web.robinson-west.com at
http://xerxes.robinson-west.com look?  I still think 
there's something wrong with the firewall on my 386.

One problem I ran into is that I use absolute addressing 
in a lot of pages and had to manually change many 
web.robinson-west.com links to xerxes.robinson-west.com, 
what a pain.  

Next I need to come up with either an rsync scheme or mount 
the directories on the backup server to the primary so 
that people can update both sites.  It's either that or 
add three mounts to the three I already have clients
doing.  I matched up the user accounts manually so that 
the same uids and gids are used on both machines.  This
way there shouldn't be permission problems copying files 
between the two servers.  One other change I've done on 
the backup is that I've stripped out the email addresses 
on a number of pages, maybe this isn't necessary though 
to discourage abuse.

My CVS book seems to cause the backup site to crash so
I took it off.

My only real complaint with Comcast is they block ICMP now for no good
reason.  Great.  I can kiss playing games or using IRC on some servers
that ping you to see if you're alive goodbye.

Probably best to stay away from Linksys for now.  The Free Software
Foundation is suing Linksys for violating the GPL at the moment.

Actually, this is less of a problem if people would just use proxy
caches.  Speaking of which, anybody know how to make squid request
from another proxy like a browser would?

Wouldn't another trick be writing spam to a ramdisk instead of hard
disk so that it's easy to erase completely?  That way if there's
a false positive it's easy to catch while any spam doesn't have
to be cleared with anything beyond the standard rm.  It's not
a good idea to just delete some spam from the standpoint it
may accumulate being of a nature that one wouldn't want a
forensics team to find it from the standpoint it could be deemed
illegal with there being no way to show that it's unsolicited.
Besides, a virus could be spam where even deleting it a clever
cracker may find a way to activate the deleted file considering
that perhaps only the first bit of the file is potentially 
gone.

Just hitting delete considered harmful.  Report your spam.
http://spamcop.net/ greatly simplifies the process.

Report your spam.  If the more people that report net abuse instead of just
accepting it's existence, the faster net abuse will stop being viewed
as a good get-rich-quick scam.

Bill,
Do:
  man cut
for all the details

example:
cat filename | cut -d':' -f1

cut is pretty straightforward to use. You can specify the column delimiter and 
then the field you want.  Play with it a bit and you should get the hang of 
it.

Not entirely related to this post but I've noticed that ever since I 
upgraded my system to SuSE 8.2, I cannot reboot my system anymore with 
the "reboot" command. When I issue a "reboot" command the system goes 
into runlevel 6 and all of the processes shutdown but the system never 
gets to the part where it actually reboots. Instead it just hange with 
the HD activity LED on constantly. I have to press the reset button to 
get my system too reboot.

I've never seen this problem with Linux before and this is on a system 
that I've had for nearly 3 years and it has run nothing but Linux and 
I've never had any problems with the box. I don' reboot very often and 
so I guess I didn't notice this feature before. If I do a halt my 
system goes down cleanly and powers down so I'm left wondering what a 
reboot does differently and why it's broken all of a sudden.

I was scanning my network when I found a device at 192.168.100.1. This 
was a surprise because all of the devices I knew of use 192.168.1.0/24.

I narrowed the offending piece of hardware down to my Cable modem

is running micro_httpd on port 80.

Have any of you seen this and what should I do about it?

There isn't any transit from Scappoose to Rock Creek that's 
reasonable.  Even the bus from Sauvie's Island is about an 
hour's ride for going to downtown Portland, and you can't 
stay as long in downtown when using the buses.  I say PCC 
Rock Creek was at the optimal size before expansion hit.  
And as far as the supposed park and ride Jeme wake up, 
they're often full on top of being in the wrong place 
for people coming from Columbia County.

Personally, I'd prefer online Calculus and physics and only 
having to drive to a PCC campus say once a week for labs.

How many people from Beaverton en route to Vancouver have to 
go through downtown Portland?  Originally the road plans 
would have taken Cornelius Pass out across Sauvie's Island 
to Vancouver.  Unforunately, it seems that can't be done now 
where there's a ridiculous notion that the land on Sauvie's 
would have to be rezoned before a road to Vancouver could 
be built.  Even just a two lane road from 30 and Cornelius 
Pass across Sauvie's Island to Vancouver involving the 
construction of two bridges, one of which has to be built 
anyways to replace a failing one, would alleviate a lot 
of traffic congestion. Doing a two lane road limits the 
number of cars going through there which alleviates
pollution concerns some.  Especially if we start using
cleaner cars which we should be doing anyways. 
Unfortunately, the licensing taxes on more fuel
efficient cars are a disincentive when it comes
to hybrid and perhaps in the future even fuel 
cell style vehicles.  Somebody sure screwed that 
one up.

Portland State is overcrowded, many people can't get 
the classes they need to graduate where this Katie Harman 
fiasco and taking physics credits away from computer science 
majors are just small samples of the nonsense one can expect 
from there.  There's a lot of beautification going on, but 
where's the parking and how much is being done to establish 
needed facilities?  For that matter, where were the
books for the math courses the first three weeks
of the term last fall or winter?  Some bookstore 
PSU has.

Law enforcement is currently largely unwilling to patrol 
Sauvie's Island where a a major two lane road close to the 
center of it routed out to Vancouver could change that.  
Highway 30 is at four lanes, 3000 cars or so a day pass 
Scappoose. Perhaps it would have been 
better to add mass transit instead of doing the road 
expansion project or better to extend Cornelius Pass 
to Vancouver for all the folks going around.  The top 
part of the circle around Portland, the road from 
Cornelius Pass to Vancouver, is missing.  

Columbia County is the poorest in the state probably due 
largely to having zero higher education institutions and 
also due to poor access to Vancouver, which is quite 
frankly closer than Portland as the crow flies.

Scappoose has enough density, not to mention the 
wealthiest Fred Meyer's in the state thanks to the 
traffic on 30,  mass transit is becoming a realistic 
idea.  It's a better idea than those stupid 
streetcars put down the center of clogged arteries 
for the benefit of the rich living in new riverfront 
condos just south of downtown Portland.  So much for 
keeping the riverfront clear and spending 
transportation dollars wisely.  Mass transit systems 
either need to be up off the streets or under them, 
but for gosh sakes not on them.  They also need to be
fast enough to matter without too many stops.  The
streetcars are cars that need a special light 
guage rail, how stupid.

Get out more Jeme, be more realistic.

Message-ID: <A7GC2VQSTOXSTN4Y1X8T21YXE03V.3f8f70d3@miked>

Is there a way to get an incoming e-mail to prompt an outgoing FAX?

I have a FAX I want to have sent to someone sho sends an e-mail with their FAX 
number in the subject.

I'm guessing that I can set up a procmail filter to identify the incoming mail, 
like with a unique address like faxmeback at domain.com. 

After that, I have no idea what to do.

A cache at the individual ISP level would be very nice, I agree... but
do most have such a thing available?  I know mine doesn't.

Public caches can't run as fast as a direct connection to the web server
because they're either free with limited resources or cost money - and
who wants to pay?

A cache at the LAN level isn't going to make a significant dent in
things.

So, if you don't mind, would you elaborate on your proxy cache idea? 
:-)

As for chaining squid, IIRC it is pretty easy.  Just looked it up in
squid.conf.default:

#  TAG: cache_peer
#       To specify other caches in a hierarchy, use the format:
#
#               cache_peer hostname type http_port icp_port
#
#       For example,
#
#       #                                        proxy  icp
#       #                                        proxy  icp
#       #          hostname             type     port   port  options
#       #          -------------------- -------- ----- -----  -----------
#       cache_peer parent.foo.net       parent    3128  3130  [proxy-only]
#       cache_peer sib1.foo.net         sibling   3128  3130  [proxy-only]
#       cache_peer sib2.foo.net         sibling   3128  3130  [proxy-only]
#
#             type:  either 'parent', 'sibling', or 'multicast'.
#
#       proxy_port:  The port number where the cache listens for proxy
#                    requests.
#
#         icp_port:  Used for querying neighbor caches about
#                    objects.  To have a non-ICP neighbor
#                    specify '7' for the ICP port and make sure the
#                    neighbor machine has the UDP echo port
#                    enabled in its /etc/inetd.conf file.
#
#           options: proxy-only
#                    weight=n
#                    ttl=n

#                    default
#                    round-robin
#                    multicast-responder
#                    closest-only
#                    no-digest
#                    no-netdb-exchange
#                    no-delay
#                    login=user:password | PASS | *:password
#                    connect-timeout=nn
#                    digest-url=url
#                    allow-miss
#                    max-conn
#                    htcp
#                    carp-load-factor
#
#                    use 'proxy-only' to specify that objects fetched
#                    from this cache should not be saved locally.
#
#                    use 'weight=n' to specify a weighted parent.
#                    The weight must be an integer.  The default weight
#                    is 1, larger weights are favored more.
#
#                    use 'ttl=n' to specify a IP multicast TTL to use
#                    when sending an ICP queries to this address.
#                    Only useful when sending to a multicast group.
#                    Because we don't accept ICP replies from random
#                    hosts, you must configure other group members as
#                    peers with the 'multicast-responder' option below.
#
#                    use 'no-query' to NOT send ICP queries to this
#                    neighbor.
#
#                    use 'default' if this is a parent cache which can
#                    be used as a "last-resort." You should probably
#                    only use 'default' in situations where you cannot
#                    use ICP with your parent cache(s).
#
#                    use 'round-robin' to define a set of parents which
#                    should be used in a round-robin fashion in the
#                    absence of any ICP queries.
#
#                    'multicast-responder' indicates that the named peer
#                    is a member of a multicast group.  ICP queries will
#                    not be sent directly to the peer, but ICP replies
#                    will be accepted from it.
#
#                    'closest-only' indicates that, for ICP_OP_MISS
#                    replies, we'll only forward CLOSEST_PARENT_MISSes
#                    and never FIRST_PARENT_MISSes.
#
#                    use 'no-digest' to NOT request cache digests from
#                    this neighbor.
#
#                    'no-netdb-exchange' disables requesting ICMP
#                    RTT database (NetDB) from the neighbor.
#
#                    use 'no-delay' to prevent access to this neighbor
#                    from influencing the delay pools.
#
#                    use 'login=user:password' if this is a personal/workgroup
#                    proxy and your parent requires proxy authentication.
#                    Note: The string can include URL escapes (i.e. %20 for
#                    spaces). This also means that % must be written as %%.
#
#                    use 'login=PASS' if users must authenticate against
#                    the upstream proxy. This will pass the users credentials
#                    as they are to the peer proxy. This only works for the
#                    Basic HTTP authentication sheme. Note: To combine this
#                    with proxy_auth both proxies must share the same user
#                    database as HTTP only allows for one proxy login.
#                    Also be warned that this will expose your users proxy
#                    password to the peer. USE WITH CAUTION
#
#                    use 'login=*:password' to pass the username to the
#                    upstream cache, but with a fixed password. This is meant
#                    to be used when the peer is in another administrative
#                    domain, but it is still needed to identify each user.
#                    The star can optionally be followed by some extra
#                    information which is added to the username. This can
#                    be used to identify this proxy to the peer, similar to
#                    the login=username:password option above.
#
#                    use 'connect-timeout=nn' to specify a peer
#                    specific connect timeout (also see the
#                    peer_connect_timeout directive)
#
#                    use 'digest-url=url' to tell Squid to fetch the cache
#                    digest (if digests are enabled) for this host from
#                    the specified URL rather than the Squid default
#                    location.
#
#                    use 'allow-miss' to disable Squid's use of only-if-cached
#                    when forwarding requests to siblings. This is primarily
#                    useful when icp_hit_stale is used by the sibling. To
#                    extensive use of this option may result in forwarding
#                    loops, and you should avoid having two-way peerings
#                    with this option. (for example to deny peer usage on
#                    requests from peer by denying cache_peer_access if the
#                    source is a peer)
#
#                    use 'max-conn' to limit the amount of connections Squid
#                    may open to this peer.
#
#                    use 'htcp' to send HTCP, instead of ICP, queries
#                    to the neighbor.  You probably also want to
#                    set the "icp port" to 4827 instead of 3130.
#
#                    use 'carp-load-factor=f' to define a parent
#                    cache as one participating in a CARP array.
#                    The 'f' values for all CARP parents must add
#                    up to 1.0.
#
#
#       NOTE: non-ICP/HTCP neighbors must be specified as 'parent'.
#
#Default:
# none

The documentation in that file is nothing if not complete.  :-)

Do you have the APM module loaded?

This is a good idea!  I liked it so much that I've done it in Mandrake
9.1 using Evolution with SpamAssassin.  The key is that /tmp is in RAM.

Here's my *one* filter in Evolution:

Rule name: SpamAssassin    Execute actions -> if all criteria are met

If +Add:  Pipe Message to Shell Command -> /home/[uid]/spam-filter.sh ,
does not return -> 0 

Then +Add:  Move to Folder -> "Spam" in "Local Folders"

That's the entire filter.  Here's the script /home/[uid]/spam-filter.sh,
as I'm using the Razor agent and reporting spam back to its databases...

* * *

export LANG=en_US
spamassassin -ea > /home/[uid]/test.txt
let rc=$?
if [ ${rc}!=0 ] ; then
        touch /tmp/mbox
        spamassassin -r < /home/[uid]/test.txt
fi
exit ${rc}

* * *

The "[uid]" must be replaced with your userid, both above and elsewhere.

The "touch" command creates the mailbox file the first time following a
reboot.  Afterwards, it doesn't do anything but update the access time.

To test this, I allocated /tmp/mbox using touch, then tested the script:

/home/[uid]/spam-filter.sh < spam.txt > /tmp/mbox

That worked (spam.txt I use as input to sa-learn), so I finished it up:

rm /home/[uid]/evolution/local/Spam/mbox

ln -s /tmp/mbox /home/[uid]/evolution/local/Spam/mbox

I moved the contents of my Evolution Spam folder to /tmp/mbox, shutdown
and restarted Evolution.  This works, so I can look for false-positives.

Robert Munro

Apologize for the top posting.  I also feel stupid because I was thinking that it was the rc files because I was so unfamiliar with procmail.  However, the  permissions were not set right.  Hopefully, it will work now.  Its only a matter of time before the spam comes rolling in.

I would report all spam if there's an easy way to report it - is there a 
way that I don't know about out there?  Something like Spamcop is a PITA 
if you have more than a handful to report.

Doesn't all of your mail get written to some incoming spool before being 
delivered and processed by Spamassassin rendering the ramdisk as just a 
really fast way to store your spam?

I really don't think you need to be quite so paranoid about the content 
of spam.

Encourage your ISP to start one.  All it takes is an extra machine
comparable to a Windows gaming box hardware wise, and it's trivial to
make it a transparent proxy so your users never have to change
anything to use it.  Bonus points if you can convince your ISP to use
adzapper with it: They could even advertize truly ad-free web browsing
then.

Well, it does if you're limited on bandwidth and have several users.
Like six geeks, one cable connection.  I don't think even an adzapping
proxy cache would have saved us if we were on DSL.

Everybody's gotta do it.

Right, I already saw that, but I never could get it to do that.

I don't understand what needs reporting or to whom.

I believe in open relays.  I believe in pamphleteering.  I don't believe
in punishment.

Blacklists and blackhole lists are blind censorship.

I filter my mail for convenience only.

Please consider bottom posting, it keeps conversations easier to follow.

My evolution filters are separate from procmail. I just right click a
message and tell it to make a filer based on that message. works like a
charm to sort things for me, I get all of the mail on this PC via pop3.

Those are two different signals to the BIOS.  My guess is that you have
a ...hmm... broken ?? errr... older BIOS?  The new default kernel was
probably compiled without support for your ummm... particular BIOS.  You
might want to try updating your BIOS before changing your kernel.  See
your motherboard manufacturer's web site for more information.  Warning,
this usually entails booting into DOS and can be a very scary
experience. 

Good Luck,

More roads to not alleviate congestion.  This is one of those times where
most folks' common sense is absolutely contradictory to the real world
(sort of like the common sense notion that things must touch in order to
have mechanical effect on each other which was shattered by Newton).

The good people of Atlanta, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Detroit can tell you
all about how much their congestion was relieved by new road construction.

Fuel efficiency and emissions are red herrings.  The real problem is the
automobile itself.  They do not operate on a human scale and as a result
destroy the basic mechanisms of human civilization.  They keep people
apart spatially and (partially as a result of the spatial separation)
psychologically.  Their scale of operation (high speed and huge size)
removes the practical need for closely constructed, fully functioning
neighborhoods.  (Why should we have a grocery store here when there's a
megamart five miles down the road?)  This creates an expectation of
convenience and a sense of entitlement to that which is not practically
available.  The constant travelling also decreases the number of
opportunities for chance encounters with other human beings and virtually
eliminates familiarity with one's neighbors and the need to get along well
with those whom one would not normally seek out as companions.

I could go on.  This only brushes the surface.

In my opinion, there's far too much parking downtown.  There's probably
more parking downtown than actual ground acreage.

Mass transit would have been a great idea, but the people of Columbia
County have been totally unreceptive to the idea of building a rail
system.

Why would you want people to go AROUND the city?  To continue the illusion

The crow is not a human being.  Geography is more than just distance on a
map.  There's a big fucking river there.  Respect that.  It's not just
some obstacle for you overcome and subdue.

The Fred Meyer is probably part of the reason it's such a poor county.
Fred Meyer can only exist because people drive there to do all their
shopping in one place.  We know what this does to small, local businesses
that could be filling those niches.

Here's another case where efficiency is totally destructive.  An
"inefficient" system with dozens of shops (one in each neighborhood) would
employ more people and, being owner-operated, keep the profits in the
county.

I don't know whether to laugh or cry when someone says that a Fred Meyer
or a Wal-Mart or Target or something is coming into town and calls it
"investment in the community" and says that's a good thing.  Nothing could
be worse for a community than to have a new shop built that is owned by
someone outside the area.  The argument comes that the new establishment
will employ local people and that's good for the local economy.  However,
the fact is that it is very much a financial INVESTMENT and a good
investment is one from which you draw more than you put in.  The intent of
the remote owners is to suck more money out of the community than they
put into it.

Well, streetcars down the center of clogged arteries ARE a good idea.

However, the new South Waterfront (as they're now calling John's Landing,
I guess) is the worst idea EVER.  It will be nothing buy high priced
housing and fancy new office space for upscale business.  The public
transit is necessary only to get the poor people in for working in the
shops to serve the rich people.  And there is enough geographic separation
between that and the real downtown area to keep the homeless people from
accidentally wandering in.  And if they try to ride the streetcar, well,
that's why we have transit cops.

> Mass transit systems either need to be up off the streets or under them,
> but for gosh sakes not on them.

They need to REPLACE private transportation on the same routes.

The streets should be for people operating at a human scale (pedestrians,
cyclists, scooters or the like for the elderly and otherwise infirm) and
the occassional commercial or emergency vehicle.  Anybody travelling
beyond that scale in speed or size should be on a rail.

> They also need to be fast enough to matter without too many stops.  The

And WHY is that stupid?  It's cheaper to maintain, provides a smoother
ride, runs with greater mechanical efficiency, and is less prone to
accidental collision than a vehicle on a paved road with pneumatic tires.

> Get out more Jeme, be more realistic.

I get out a whole lot.  And I see more of the city than you can get from
behind your TV-like windshield.

I think you're shooting from the hip and working from your internal
notions of what things SHOULD be like without having any experience what
how these things really work.  Building more roads has NEVER decreased
congestion.  Adding lanes actually DECREASES average speeds due to
turbulence effects from cars changing lanes to jockey for position.
Auto emissions are nothing compared to the enormous emissions of
refineries, tire plants, and road run-off from leaky machines plus the
ridiculous waste of junkyards, tire dumps, drive-thru disposables, etc.
etc. etc...  It's a nightmare stream of endless garbage and poison with
exactly one very short generation of usefulness.

Grow up and get responsible.  We've got lots of work to do to shape this
place up for our great-great-grandchildren and their
great-great-grandchildren.

As the Iriquois law stated (as recorded by Thomas Jefferson, a great
admirer of the Iriquois):  Make every decision with respect for its impact
on the seventh generation, even if this requires skin as thick as the bark
of a pine.

In other words, butch up, pussy... it's not your world to trash.  So get
out there and work harder for the people that really matter:  those who
will not be born for two hundred years.

You could've done the whole thing with perl.

perl -e 'while (<>){ push @array, (split $_)[0] }' output.txt

Or something close to that for your purposes.

Forgive stupid syntax problems, it's very late and it's my birthday (as of

curl -C - -O http://url.to.get/path/name/to/file.iso

The "-C -" (continue, find place automatically) option requires the HTTP
server on the other end to support file resuming, but it sounds like the
site does.

I haven't found this option in Mozilla yet either.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0310170508440.8120-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I've read all the follow ups to this but didn't want to get lost in the 
thread.

I work for an ISP that uses Qwest as one of it's DSL providers.  Here are 
some points in no particular order.

*  Sometimes Qwest DSL connections just go down and require either a power 
   cycle on the CPE and/or a bounce of the circuit in our router.  This 
   has become such an issue that a few routers (not Cisco) include a 
   bounce function as part of the OS (Redback I seem to remember.)
      We monitor anyone that asks and is not blocking pings and get pager 
   alerts when a DSL line goes down ie. no ping response.  Usually with 
   in minutes we bounce the circuit.  (An automated circuit bounce process
   is in the works.)

*  A Firewall (doing NAT) behind a CPE doing NAT (routed circuit) sucks 
   for speed.  A Firewall behind CPE with a bridged circuit is a good 
   thing.  I know as my home DSL line was the former for awhile.

*  Actiontec 1520 has a web based setup on the LAN side and takes about
   5 minutes to talk a slightly clueful customer through.

*  Cisco 678 (675) has a management cable and text base interface.  Don't
   go that way with the home user if possible.  Qwest no longer provides 
   Ciscos.

*  Most off the (local) shelf firewall/routers are not very efficent.  
   Some eating up to 25% of your bandwidth.  Well let me qualify that
    - Linksys on a direct wireless connection.  I haven't tested a Linksys
   on a DSL line.
      I use an Asante FR3004C with serial port.  If DSL (not the phone 
   line goes down) I power up the modem connected to the serial port.  
   Change one setting in the Asante, restart it, and I'm back online 
   though a bit slower.

*  SDSL trumps ADSL.  Costs more but if you're going to do any kind of 
   hosting on the DSL you'll appreciate it.

*  Qwest is Qwest.  We have a Qwest technician as a customer.  He thinks 
   we provide better ISP and technical services than he gets from Qwest.

I think its the poorsest in the state because of the lack of lucerative 
industries (which aren't the same as high-tech industries.) I don't see any 
reason why businesses with low-wage, high head-count jobs can't locate in the 
county. A call center in Clatskanie, perhaps?

Reporting it either costs me money or takes up too much time, which are 
both resources I don't want to spend on this irritating practice. I tried 
reporting it once upon a time, but the results proved it doesn't have any 
measurable effect. My SPAM load is still increasing.

I'm thinking that waiting for the ISPs to clean house on their own will be 
more likely once the SPAM load through their servers reaches critical mass 
and starts to debilitate their service and they lose customers. They sure 
need a bigger incentive than responding to people's reporting just to be 
good neighbors.

Apparently those can be forged now.  There was a Wired article on

For those who don't have the time to read this now, or who want to
bookmark it, it's on my website.  http://ursine.ca/~baloo/

The Virus Infected Blackhole List is dead, both mine and the one that
used to be vbl.messagelabs.com.  So what's a postmaster to do?

This is my new solution to the Virus Infected Blackhole List.  I got
tired of maintaining it.  That's a damn good trick, since as of this
writing (10/17/2003), I have a crappy job watching a door 10 hours a
night, four nights a week, at a children's hospital and you *need*
something to keep your mind occupied and off the *increadably*
depressing surroundings.

Start off with exim4-daemon-heavy, clamav-daemon, and
clamav-freshclam.  It's in sid.  If you're using woody, go find a
backport, please do not pin, as this *will* break your system.  Go
read the debian-user archives for why.

Get it working.  If you successfully installed it, it's probably
working.

Edit /etc/exim4/conf.d/acl/40_exim4-config_check_data and add this
before the accept comment at the end.

  # Deny viruses.

  deny message = Message contains malware or a virus ($malware_name).
       log_message = $sender_host_address tried sending $malware_name
       demime = *
       malware = *

Now, go edit /etc/exim4/conf.d/main/01_exim4-config_listmacros and add
this below the banner at the top.

  av_scanner = clamd:/var/run/clamd.ctl

Restart exim4.  Congratulations, you now bounce viruses at SMTP time.

Yeah, by sending viruses to create open relays.  If that happens to

Give it two months before passing judgement about whether or not

If you get compromised and become an open relay, by direct action of
cracker or by virus, you deserve to have your ISP suspend or cancel
your account.

Yes, good system administration is essential no matter what operating system
you use but saying that someone "deserves" to have there account canceled
is a little harsh IMO. Any ISP that did have such a policy would soon
lose my business.

That said, I can understand suspending the account until they fixed the
open relay/cracked server.

If people don't want to take the time to report spammers at least post
the spam to news.admin.net-abuse.sightings (guidelines for posting can
be found at http://www.killfile.org/~tskirvin/nana/charter/nanas.html).
There are ISPs that search the group for domains or IP addresses that
belong to them to look for abusers.

One only has to look at the spam statistics (see 
http://www.raingod.com/angus/Computing/Internet/Spam/Statistics/) to 
realize that efforts like SpamCop are not getting the job done. 
They're not even making a dent in the load.  Pretty soon, people with 
small personal servers (like me) are going to be getting so much spam that 
it will look the same as a permanent DDoS attack.

I think we need to get rid of anonymous e-mail for starters. If such a
system could be set up, I think I'd shut down sendmail and use the new
service. It's the same thing as abandoning Usenet for private,
spam-excluded mailing lists. Then people can choose to use a secure mail
system or stick with the chaotic anarchy of the current system.

In the old days, the anarchy was great, but then you had to learn the lore 
to join the tribe. Now any idiot can get into the game, and there's too 
many. You can't fight massed ignorance head-on. Best to just step aside 
and let it blunder into some other obstacle. But we need a choice; right 
now we don't have much, and it doesn't take a genius to see the 
catastrophe coming.

I gave it 6 months 1.5 years ago, during which time my spam volume

Bill,

Sorry, I don't know how to do arrays in shell.  About the time someone

The requirements for posting there means more work than
reporting to the spammer's ISP. I think e-mail MUAs
should be smart enough to do this automagically when the
user clicks on a "Report spam" button.

Encouraging an ISP to set up a proxy isn't a bad idea - it would perhaps
speed things up when generally browsing the web.  Maybe they could set
it up to cache from things like gentoo.oregonstate.edu, wherever debian
downloads from, and v4.windowsupdate.microsoft.com regardless of size of
download.. just put some big disks in there.

Setting up adzapper or somesuch with it is a decent idea, too.  I,
personally, use SquidGuard for my content filtering needs.

But setting up either of those transparently - no - that can lead to
problems.  Transparent proxies are *not* fool-proof.  You can (and do)
run in to problems when you use a transparent proxy, although the
problems are not terribly common.

Encourage folks to use the proxy manually (hell - they could provide a
.reg file for the Windows lusers)... advertise it with "Hey!  This
speeds up your Web Browsing!" or something.

One geek and five non-geeks here.  I set up a transparent squid proxy
for my LAN.  It uses SquidGuard to filter out porn and ads.

We just have DSL.

I don't honestly notice a day-to-day speed improvement, except when I
browse to a site that's heavy in static graphics that somebody has been
to before (although I don't think any of us ever hit the same website as
somebody else, except perhaps google and ebay)... or Windows
Updates/other big downloads.  WinUp gets run on one machine, then the
next machine runs it and the downloads happen in a matter of seconds.

You need to probably run db_upgrade on the whitelist database before you can
use the check_whitelist perl script that comes with SpamAssassin ( in the
tools dir ). The check_whitelist script will output the contents of the
database in a readable format. Have a look at the script though. I have
never gotten it to work without tweaking it.

You misunderstood my statement.

I know that you think unsolicited mail requires reporting to spamcop.net,
but that doesn't answer WHY you think this needs to happen and WHY
spamcop.net is a good thing.

It sounds to me like collective coersion.  Some self-appointed authority
is trying to modify the behavior of others through intimidation and
censorship.

Not a good thing in my book.

Because the mass transit infrastructure is for shit or nonexistent,

It can't support a high head-count facility.  There isn't appropriate low
income housing or appreciable neighborhood facilities.

And do you really want the kind of surburban wasteland that passes for

This is wrong on so many levels.

Open relays should be the standard.  People should pass each others' mail,
no questions asked.  It doesn't take that much.  The only reason we don't
ALL have open relays is because SOME do not and that focusses the burden
on those that do instead of distributing it across the entire network and
so the burden becomes higher than it should be and more relays are
restricted and the cycle reinforces itself.

Secondly, the only thing people DESERVE is to be forgiveness and
dignified, kind, respectful treatment.  If something unfortunate happens
to a person or happens because of a person, the humane response is to
forgive the person and work with the new situation.  If help must be lent,
lend it.  If sympathy will help, share that.  Punishment is positive
feedback for pain and misery.

What's wrong with people that they must work so hard to cause each other
problems?

  Many thanks to all of you who helped me recover from my self-imposed,
accidently mess with my notebook this week. A night's sleep and I went into
/etc/rc.d/rc.modules and discovered that the apm module was commented out. A
quick ^d fixed that. Now it works again just like before.

  It's still up for sale: with Slackware-9.1 installed and purring along. A
Toshiba Portege 3025CT: 300MMX processor, 96M RAM (that's the maximum), 6.5
Gb hard drive, 2 cm thick, less than 1 kg weight. Comes with 10/100 Fast
ethernet pcmcia card, external cdrom drive (also pcmcia), two A/C adapters,
external floppy drive, external port replicator and manuals. Both main and
CMOS batteries replace in the last year. An excellent, light-weight machine.
$500.

  EmperorLinux will be shipping my new machine next week. I'm the first to
ask for Slackware-9.1 on it so they're still tuning that so all the on-board
functions work. Of course, then they'll have the install for this all worked
out for other orders. I'm impressed with these guys based on the transaction
so far.

I meant that ISPs' only incentive is to be a good neighbor and act on spam 
incidents. But they don't have to do anything, and most ignore these 
reports. Being a good neighbor isn't high on many ISPs priority list when 
it costs them money to take any action.  Therefore, reporting spam is a 
waste of time.

BTW, you wrote earlier that you are in favor of open relays. Do you have 
one on your machine, or are you just speaking hypocritically?

That's absurd.  With that level of inundation, no person would EVER
read email and the entire spam system would die under its own weight.
A balance will be reached.  We're over that balancing point now and it's
just taking time for the system to find equilibrium.

I've been using USENET ALOT lately and I have seen very little spam.

And have you ever considered the social repercussions of abandoning USENET
for private mailing lists?  For one, it is more exclusive and less likely
to include unsolicited opinion and points of view.  This is a great
detriment to intellectual discussion.  Points of view are limited to those
who know where the list is and have subscribed explicitly.  USENET allows
for free browsing of groups in a loose topical hierarchy so that all
discussions are easily found in one place and a person can pop in and out
of discussions on their own time.

For open discussions, USENET is far superior to email lists.

I'll take the anarchy, thanks.  Authorities will never bring the same
level of freedom, flexibility, and harmony that anarchy can.

Yeah, Bill, you're right.  It's all about you being better than everyone
else.  The ignorant, unwashed masses just aren't good enough to play in
your internet.

Forgive my sarcasm, but that kind of thinking is just elitist crap.
People can and will learn to be good to each other.

Wash your hands of the whole situation and let people make things worse
for themselves?  If you're so much better than most people, perhaps you
could share some of that great wisdom and experience and TEACH.  Ignorance
isn't fought head-on by slamming the ignorant against their shortcomings
over and over, ignorance is fought sidelong by joining in the ranks and
sharing your enlightened views.  It takes time and patience and
forgiveness, but it yields the greatest positive results.

It doesn't take a genius to see that catastrophe wouldn't be the END,
either.  Something bad might happen.  But your idea of "the death of
email" is absurd.  If the system becomes unusable, it will be unusable to
the spammers as well.  It will not have to be abandoned, it will just
change shape.  I think USENET is a fine example here.  It became unusable
for a while, but the results just didn't justify the level of inundation.
Equilibrium has been achieved.

How would they act?  By punishing people and censoring them?  How is THAT
being a good neighbor?

This is an essential flaw in market capitalism carried to this extent.
The funny thing is that almost NOTHING makes money without massive public
funding, yet we call that "profitable".

Not so much hypocritically as hypothetically.  I have several mail servers
and some are open and some are not.  It's an unfortunate situation, but I
am unable to reach some people through an open relay, so I must keep a
system playing by the rules of the anti-spam dictatorship in order to not
be censored.

Also, an open relay does cost me something in bandwidth.  This would not
be an issue if everyone's relays were open, however.

alt.sex used to be a useful newsgroup, ordinary discussions about
ordinary sex.  now it's 100% spam.  nobody reads it any more.
the spam hasn't stopped.  this has been going on for years now,
and it doesn't seem to be dying at all.  I think your model of
the world is flawed.

Wow.  Do you agree there are 'bad guys' out there on the Internet? 
People who do things they shouldn't?  Or are you saying there *isn't*
anything bad you can do on the Internet?  If you can spread a worm or
virus, or emailbomb somebody, that's ok, there's nothing wrong with it?

If we were all open relays somebody could, with virtually no effort at
all, email bomb somebody quite effectively.  The spreading of viruses
and worms among Windows users would be able to happen a lot quicker.

Spam could increase exponentially, clogging down mail servers
everywhere.

No, not everybody deserves forgiveness or kind, dignified, respectful
treatment.  Punishment is necessary in the world... but I don't think we
want to get too far into that discussion, we'll get way further off
topic.

There's should be a text select option. Look for a T with a select box
next to it.
If not, it probably means that the author has disabled that.
Using a tool like pdf2ps, etc... might allow that you to get around having
to hand type it.

Bill,

On Red Hat systems, pdftotext comes as part of the xpdf rpm. On Debian
systems, pdftotext comes as part of the xpdf-utils package.

Or, you can use the little text-select tool in Adobe Acrobat reader.

  Yes. Two ways; three, actually.

1. If the pdf was generated by a linux tool or Adobe's distiller then you
can simply block the text in xpdf or acroread and paste it into either a
virtual terminal or a gen-u-whine X application.

2. Same source as above: run the pdf file through 'ps2ascii <input.pdf>
<output.txt>' then clean up the closed-up words with a text editor.

3. If the file was scanned, run it through 'pdftopbm' to translate to a
bit-mapped format that gocr can recognize. Then read the man page for gocr
and generate one .txt file for each page in the original pdf document. Takes
some cleaning -- depending on the quality of the scan and the fonts used --
but it is faster than rekeying everything.

I am having some issue moving some gdbm file from an old rehdat 6.2 box
to 9.  It seems that gdbm has changed?

rpm -qa | grep -i dbm
gdbm-devel-1.7.3-19
gdbm-1.7.3-19

9.0:

rpm -qa | grep -i dbm
gdbm-devel-1.8.0-20
gdbm-1.8.0-20


Is there a conversion program?  This is highly annoying.

Ayup.

Indeed.  Mind-blowing, isn't it?

I don't believe there are 'bad guys' or 'good guys'.  There's just a bunch
of guys.

Do you really believe there are bad guys?  Can you just pick them out of a
line-up and dispose of them or do we have somehow winkle them out with
bait so we can end their miserable lives?

Life sure would be good if there weren't other people with conflicting
desires messing things up for me!  Let's put together some more prisons.
Surely that'll solve the problem.  After all, the United States has more
people in prison per capita than any other industrialized nation, so our
crime rate is the low... oh, wait.

> People who do things they shouldn't?

Everyone does things they shouldn't; by other people's standards and even
their own.

> Or are you saying there *isn't* anything bad you can do on the Internet?

I got all kinds of ideas of bad things a person can do on the internet.

Is doing something bad the only requirement to being a 'bad guy'?  If so,
then everyone's a 'bad guy'.  Who's got the black hats?

> If you can spread a worm or virus, or emailbomb somebody, that's ok,

There's nothing wrong with being able to spread an emailbomb or a virus or
a worm.  There is something wrong with actually doing it.

With closed relays, it's still quite effective.

And making it more difficult to do doesn't solve the problem.  The problem
isn't it happening, the problem is people wanting to make it happen.
Solve the root problem and you don't have to worry about whether or not
it's possible.

You don't bring down the murder rate by taking away the weapons.  You
bring down the murder rate by teaching people to respect others' lives.

(Or do you favor gun control?)

Do you have any idea how Windows worms and virii are spread?  They use the
system default SMTP server.  Presumably, a person is allowed to send mail
through their own default SMTP server.  A compromised system almost ALWAYS
has a place to relay mail.

It is not in the interest of spammers to clog down the entire mail system.
It will not happen because they would all go out of business long before
it got that bad.

This, to me, is axiomatic.  There is no basis for debate.  Either you
respect people or you spread misery and make war.

It's all the same topic.  It's about respecting people and giving them
everything you can.

> You seem to trust everybody not to harm you.

I do, but I think you might not understand what that means.  I trust
everybody to not harm me, but I don't believe nobody will.

People react much better to trust than suspicion.  People act more
responsibly when given real responsibility than when left to their own
whim and wimsy.  This is Psych 101.  Ask any parent.

Who was it that wrote "Unix doesn't prevent you from doing something
stupid because that might prevent me from doing something clever"?  I
think it relates here.  You have to give people power in order for them to
do great things.

> I don't have such faith in the world.

There really isn't any choice.  The alternative is so unpleasant.  The
only viable alternative to a social structure of mutual trust and respect
is one of totalitarian control through violent coersion.  This is
essentially the difference between the progressive and the conservative.

I believe every crime can be traced back to someone who doesn't know how
to respect other people... and that, barring physiological mental illness,
is always the way they were taught to live, either explicitly or by
example.

It's an oft-used cliche (and I guess it wouldn't be a cliche if it wasn't
oft-used), but we have to break the cycle.  It will probably take a
hundred generations of very hard work before it is the norm everywhere,
but it's worth it... and if we don't start now, it will be AT LEAST one
more generation away.

Undoubtedly.

I don't really use gdbm much, but couldn't you write your own sort of fake
conversion program where you read the db files with a tool on a box using
the old gdbm library and dumped it into another data format (like a perl
object dumped with Storable or Data::Dumper or whatever) and then read the
data back in on the other machine and output it to a db file?

I know that's a hack, but without being intimately familiar with the
internals, that's how I'd do it.

Yeah, that what I am trying to avoid doing :)  I have a bunch of silly
support files for a system and convert each one is time consuming and
likely to cause problems.  

It is really annoying that this happens,  I am betting on a RH9/gcc
issue again.  I mean why did anything change to a file format?  I am
guessing its a lib call issue (several programs are showing the same
behavior, the latest is PHP).

  Looking at gnu (and do not get me started with finding useful
information on gnu tools):

/usr/share/doc/gdbm-1.8.0/NEWS

CHANGES from 1.7.3 to 1.8
  1.  Added GDBM_CENTFREE functionality and option.
  2.  Added GDBM_COALESCEBLKS functionality and option.
  3.  Added GDBM_NOLOCK flag.
  4.  Made ``fast'' mode the default, making GDBM_FAST obsolete, and
adding
      the GDBM_SYNC flag and GDBM_SYNCMODE option.
  5.  Switched to building with libtool.

CHANGES from 1.7.2 to 1.7.3
  1.  Fixed a couple of last minute problems. (Namely, no autoconf.h in
      version.c, and no GDBM_FASTMODE in gdbm.h!)
  2.  Fixed some documentation bugs.

None of these should effect format issues.

Why isn't this being done by a cron job?  ... say, other than the
necessity to insert the speaker/topic details?  

Maybe you could have cron mail you a template with the repeating
stuff, WITH THE CORRECT DATE! :-), and then you can paste in the
variable stuff.  If you'll send me an address you will read on a
timely basis, I'll set this up myself!

I've already got a rough cut at the third-wednesday extractor:

  $ cal | tail -n +3 | cut -b 7-8 | awk '$1 > 0' | awk 'NR == 3'

or iteration 2:

  $ cal | awk 'NR > 2 && NF > 3 { week++ } week == 3 { print $(NF-3) }'

What did you identify the other proxies as?  Siblings or parents?  What
happens if you tell it another proxy is its parent?

Subject: [PLUG] wget timeout value
Message-ID: <3F90AC44.5020506@pobox.com>

I have been using wget to download files and was reading the man page to 
see how I could optimize it more.  The -T option sets the timeout value 
which is 900 seconds (15 minutes) by default.  The documentation says, 
"Please do not lower the timeout value unless you know what you are 
doing".  So I am wondering what could happen if I set it to 10 or 
something?  Does anyone know?  Would it crash the server or lock up my 
system or something?  Would it just be too much of a load on the server 
reconnecting too often?  I'm really curious but I feel like I shouldn't 
do it because, "I don't know what I am doing".

That would be nice.  Probably the only feature of AOL's email client

I dunno - the spam stuff was going over the line, IMHO.  As if earlier
posts weren't there..but... oh well.

Jeme is but a ghost as far as my email client is concerned now.  I think
I'll find the temptation to post in off-topic flame threads is a lot
less now.

Postfix's header_checks are way cool.

Subject: [PLUG] wget timeout value
In-Reply-To: <3F90AC44.5020506@pobox.com>
References: <3F90AC44.5020506@pobox.com>
Message-ID: <200310172138.09436.mark@linuxhardware.net>

wget and the -T option, in my experience was a headache, simply because 
setting it seemed to do nothing.  It seems that wget, at least on Linux, is 
using the value in: 

/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_retries2

for timeouts, which is set to 15 minutes. Lower this value and your timeout 
will match.  I had to use wget for a very large harvesting project, and this 
was the source of much frustration.

However, there is a patch, that will allow wget's -T to behave independent of 
the value in tcp_retries2.

Here is the link:
http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/409/2000/11/0/4723942/

I've been using a version of wget compiled with this patch for quite sometime 
and have been very happy with the results.

More information can be found here:

http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/409/2000/1/0/3189215/

I'd be more than happy to help you compile a version with the patch in place 
should you need it.

I have a faint, rusty memory that making the timeout value too low could cause 
some problems navigating ipchains, or going through proxies. I've forgotten 
everything about ipchains, so who knows. As far as just sitting down and 
typing something like 'wget  www.masses.o.mp3s.com', and wandering away while 
it goes to work, I can't imagine what awful things could happen by changing 
the timeout value to something that suits you better. I think none, unless 
you use it in some automated functions, and it gives up too soon if there is 
connection flakiness.

I suppose too long a timeout could get annoying if you have some kind of bot 
or script that retrieves pages at regular intervals, and it waits too long to 
give up on a bad connection.

Don't you love helpful man pages?  :P

That doesn't work over reboots, because Evolution reallocates the Spam
mbox file on disk when it doesn't find it at the linked /tmp location,
so the "touch" line should be deleted.  Instead, add the following two
lines somewhere in /etc/rc.sysinit:

# Cleanup Spam mailbox
rm -f /tmp/mbox
touch /tmp/mbox

Disclaimer:  I haven't rebooted to test this yet, but it *should* work.

Yeah, swen hit and suddenly Usenet went practically spam-free.  I like
it.  Maybe the spammers are getting hit too hard by a taste of their
own medicine to spam on Usenet anymore.  One can only hope.

The internet is more communist than anarchist, really; though neither
communism nor anarchy has a central authority or government.
Communism implies self-regulation in which each person participates
more or less cooperatively, anarchy is a bit more selfish (I'll do
what I want, everybody else be damned).  Communism's self-regulation
system has mostly worked for the Internet since it's creation, I'd
rather not see that change now.  It's a system that works well, just
not when basic needs of living are involved (which is why communism
doesn't work in real life on a scale larger than a commune, and there
has never been a truly communist country).

Not grep, which only finds things and prints the entire line.

Actually, GNU grep has the --only-matching (-o) option which shows
"only the part of a matching line that matches" the indicated regex.
It's simplistic in the sense that it'll only return one match per
line, but given the right input it works well enough, e.g.,

# get list of ftp mirrors for red hat 9
wget -q -O - http://www.redhat.com/mirrors/ |\
  grep -oi "ftp://.*/9/en/os/i386/"

Thanks Paul, pdftotext worked.  

BTW, I've been meaning to ask you for your opinion on the future of Red
Hat.  I read somewhere that us coolies were going to be using something
maintained by Fedora. Would you comment on whether the average user (one
or two systems, medium Linux skills) should stick with Red Hat or maybe
move to Debian?

I don't know who taught you social politics, but they were grossly
misinformed.

Communism is an economic system and anarchism is a social structure.  You
need both an economic system and a social structure to have a society.

You could be anarcho-communist or anarcho-capitalist (though you'd have to
be downright misanthropic for that one) or democratic socialist or
whatever.  Me, I'm more of a libertarian socialist or an
anarcho-syndicalist.

But your idea that anarchism requires selfishness is so dead wrong, I
hardly know where to begin.  The selfish are very rarely anarchist unless
they are dead set on destroying civilization.  Selfishness is a "one man
against the world" philosophy and it simply cannot be supported unless
there is a massive state to protect that one man from the world.

Lots of people confuse communism with a political system (typically the
soviet system).  I think this is basically a result of very poor education
due to Red Scare politics through most of the last century preventing
adequate public discourse.

Self-regulation is a matter of each individual regulating his or her self.
When spamcop.net tells ISPs to shut down service or else the entire
service's mail will be blackholed, that is coersion and has no place in a
self-regulating system.

Communism (the real thing, not the idea to which you've attached that
name) is very difficult when basic needs are involved because some
barbaric people still quest for power over their fellow man and would seek
control over the flow of necessary goods and services as a lever for
personal power.

It's also fairly true that no social or economic system scales well.
(This is true for almost any system, really.)  Once a system gets so large
that every participant cannot see and understand the whole of the
mechanism, it breaks down and starts acting in unpredictable ways.  There
are purely automatic systems that require no conscious intervention (the
natural cycle of birth, death, decay, and growth, for example), but those
are obviously different from most human-designed systems.

For example, the internet works as a physical structure (though nobody
knwos how we're going to reincorporate all of those obsolete parts as
upgrades take place -- but we'll call manufacturing of components a
different system for convenience) and doesn't foul up packet passing badly
every day because piecewise or as a whole, each component does exactly the
same thing.  It scales more or less infinitely because the differences
between a network of forty nodes (which a person could easily grasp
intellectually) and a network of forty thousand is just the number of
hops.  Every network engineer knows (or should know) how his little piece
of the puzzle is SUPPOSED to act and that's the same for EVERY piece of
the network.  It's essentially an automatic mechanical system that doesn't
involve human decision-making.  The allocation of IP addresses, however,
IS a human decision and is really fouled up.  And so now we've got to
consider re-allocating those addresses and maybe adding more bits to the
thing, but that means much bigger, faster hardware than we've got and oh
goodness, what a pickle!  The part that requires regular, biased
decision-making broke down because it's too big to get your head around.

Human scale is a very important design element.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0310181158001.5845-100000@gisnet.com>

Trying to pick off spam messages, I'm seeing more of this sort of trick:

 Vicod<klr5ed73hnt>in
 Prescri<kxd1l6sdjir451>pti<knkm2xp3d8skk>on

Take out the HTML tags and you can see the spam filter trigger words. This 
is what the mail reader does, so the victim can read it, but the procmail 
filter sees the tags and misses the words.

In this case, all the tags start with "<k", but I bet I can't count on 
that for long. I suppose I could check for tags between every letter, but 
testing for v(<).*>i(<).*>c(<).*>o(<).*> . . . etc. seems like too much 
work. Does anyone have any ideas how or if one can deal with this new 
spammer trick with Procmail?

There's usually enough other stuff going on in those messages to trigger
spamassassin.  Are you finding otherwise?

One option, I suppose, would be just to s/<[^>[//g the whole message
before your filter sees it.  But that's pretty destructive.

It's not a particularly new trick.  I've been seeing it for a year or so.

I went to www.zebra.org as I'm looking into how to get computers
on my LAN running Windows and Linux to use a secondary gateway
dynamically when I want or need to work on the primary.

There doesn't seem to be anyone else on the zebra mailing
list though.

If this is the case, where would be another good place 
to get help on setting up dynamic routing?  Maybe I 
should wait a while.

Is Zebra just a wrapper around other routing protocols
or can it route itself?

Message-ID: <1066511303.6805.33.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

A zebra list poster doesn't think I need to do dynamic routing
suggesting instead that I do multiple default routes.  I guess I
should use a cheap 386/486 with a floppy system or an existing
internal server and have it programmed with a default route to 
each one of my gateways.  This has the benefit of avoiding client 
side software on workstations.  An advertising from
the routers to the clients approach would probably be more 
robust though.

How do I do multiple default routes under Redhat 7.3?

I've been working on a way to, shall we say, vaporize Jeme's messages
using procmail.  But I was looking into the postfix header_check you
refered to and piqued my interest.  Can you explain how it works?
Reading through the example "sample-filter.cf" file I see that you can
REJECT, IGNORE, etc but what is the syntax for the
/etc/postfix/header_check file?

Thanks,

Brian

header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/blocks

in main.cf (I'm using blocks rather than header_check, just season to
taste) then blocks contains:

/^From: Jeme A Brelin <jeme at brelin.net>/ REJECT

Mine actually contains more than that, stuff after the REJECT line, but
I don't think we need that here.  You can add stuff after REJECT like
550: I don't like this email address or something similar.

That way, as soon as the mail server says From: Jeme A Brelin
<jeme at brelin.net> your mail server says 550: I don't like this email
address.

Can't say; I'm not using SA yet. Before I get into that though I thought
I'd explore what could be done with just Procmail first.

Yes, I still get a lot of legitimate mail that's HTML formatted; don't 
want to destroy that before I read it.

Fortunately, I haven't seen a lot of these yet, so it's not a desperate
situation at this point. The trick seemed hard to counter with what I know
about Procmail egrep filtering (which ain't much) so I'm hoping there's a 
simple solution before I get swamped with the buggers. 

I imagine this could be tough for SpamAssassin, filling its database with
lots of nonsense garbage. Or can it keep track of legitimate words vs. 
randomly-generated strings?

Well, you're really just treading over well-travelled ground.

I believe it was Larry Wall who wrote, "The existence of wheels in Unix
has not yet precluded their reinvention."

However, if you're just looking for a good way to do this filtering thing,
spamassassin is pretty darned good at it.

Well, it wouldn't destroy the mail, only the HTML formatting.

Well, that's the point, I think.  I guess the spammer's idea is that the
filtering is being done by the ISP and not the end users, so bypassing the
filter would make sense.  But if filters are implemented by end users
INSTEAD of ISPs, then there's no point trying to bypass them because the
people who actually use filters are not going to be a receptive target
audience.

Nah, it just parses the message before it runs the checks.  Pretty easy to
strip that stuff out and THEN make your decisions.

I haven't seen any rules that actually look for these random strings...
nor have I stopped to consider the unpleasant effects of such a filter.

Let me be the first to invite you to return to Boston to practice your

prefer a less agressive style.  Being polite, does not really take any
longer, and it lowers you blood pressure and might even save a life.

I'm sure somebody will be impressed with you agressive driving, but not
me.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0310181653330.26989@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Slackware uses BSD-style init scripts whereas most linux distributions
(such as Red Hat which I've used for six years) use SysV-style init scripts.
Among the differences is that with the SysV style, if I want to stop and
restart daemons such as nfs or network I type:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs stop
	/etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs start
and the equivalent for the network daemon.

  In Slackware I cannot do this. I learned from a Web page that to stop the
daemon I grep for it in the process list and kill it off. Simple enough.
But what I've not yet found is how I start it back up again without
rebooting.

  Help appreciated.

Thanks,

Rich, Slackware is similar to the above.  Look in your /etc/rc.d/
directory.  There you will find such jewels as rc.inet1, rc.nfsd,
rc.gpm, etc, etc.  Most of these scripts take a command line parameter
(ie, 'start' or 'stop' or 'restart').  Have a look through each script
to see the way they are run so when you want to create your own script
you know how it should look.

So, on your slack box if you wanted to stop nfsd you would enter:
/etc/rc.d/rc.nfsd stop  Simple enough, or rc.nfsd restart if you need
to restart her.  Have fun!

It's a good question. I've been pondering it myself. I hope my musings
don't come off as troll bait...

I've had Debian installed for some time on an old Alpha. I don't power
it up all that often -- it's mostly a plaything, really -- so my
experience with Debian had been pretty limited.

More recently, however, I installed Debian 'testing' on my wife's
computer. Now that it's running, it's a piece of cake to maintain. The
apt-* tools are really slick.

Getting it running, however, was pretty tedious. I'm sure that more
experienced Debian admins know better ways of getting the 'testing'
release installed, but for me it was difficult:

1. Tried various iso's and floppy images of the testing release -- but
   couldn't successfully complete any of them. (This trial-and-error
   process took hours...)

2. Finally, I installed a very minimal version of Debian stable and
   then tweaked (and retweaked quite a few times) the
   /etc/apt/sources.list file to point at the testing section of the
   mirrors.

3. Ran 'apt-get dist-upgrade' to get move to testing.

4. Since Debian stable is still running a 2.2 kernel, I installed a
   2.4.22 kernel package. The module settings for my NIC, however,
   didn't migrate smoothly at all. It took a bit of experimentation to
   figure out that the 2.2 rtl8139 module has been replaced in the 2.4
   series by 8139too. A newbie would have been completely stymied.

5. Then ran apt-get quite a few more times to get a working X
   installation. Again, it's not a process for newbies...

Had I simply wanted Debian stable, it would have been cake. Getting
Debian testing -- which has packages I consider reasonably up to date
-- was, for me, tedious.

But, like I said, now that it's running, it's great. I've got a
feeling I won't have to do anything but the occasional 'apt-get
update' and 'apt-get upgrade' for a long time, which makes me smile
very broadly.

Fedora will be an interesting experiment. I think of it as driven by
Red Hat, but enhanced by the community. There will be Fedora Core
(Red Hat-driven, core packages) and then Fedora Extras
(community-driven, other stuff).

So far, Red Hat is talking about two Core releases a year. Many
(most?) admins, of course want nothing to do with two upgrades a year.
Once a year is good for development desktops, and once every 24 to 36
months isn't so bad for servers and business desktops.

The big question is, will the Fedora community be successful in
supporting older Core packages once Red Hat has moved on? What we're
discussing on the Fedora Legacy mailing list is how we're going to
choose which Fedora Core releases we (the community) will support and
for how long.

It's an open question as to how well it'll work.

On the other hand, the Fedora Core beta installations have worked
pretty well for me. A couple hiccups, but, really, they're
tremendously easy to install -- and you get software that's very, very
current, often more so than Debian testing.

The great thing is, you can't really lose. Debian and Fedora/Red Hat
are both wonderful. Compared to one another, they both have strengths
and weaknesses. Compared to anything coming out of Redmond, they're so
far superior that it makes your head spin.

spamprobe ignores HTML tags for scoring purposes, to quote the man page:


Ignores HTML tags in emails for scoring purposes unless  the  -h
command line option is used.  Many spams use HTML and few humans
do so HTML tends to become a powerful recognizer of spams.  How-
ever  in  the author's opinion this also substantially increases
the likelihood of false positives if someone does  send  a  non-
spam  email containing HTML tags.  SpamProbe does pull urls from
inside of html tags however since those tend to be spammer  spe-
cific.

I've been very impressed with spamprobe, it consistently filters around
98%, the other 1 or 2 percent are always the latest spam; I only ever
see them once.  After more than a couple thousand spams, I have gotten
no false positives.

Just a PLUG.

Depending on what you're doing, a HUP might do the trick...

killall -HUP smbd nmbd -for instance.

Otherwise, if you look in /etc/rc.d, you'll see there are a few scripts
like that already, I know sshd supports start/stop/restart arguments,
for instance.

There was recently (within the last month) a long thread in
alt.os.linux.slackware about converting the daemon scripts to the Linux
standard whatchamacallit setup using start/stop/restart for each daemon
script.  You might look it up, as the OP did some work already and had
at least one script converted over.

That's odd - can you cut-and-paste the exact input and output?  ie; what
you typed and what it spat back out to you?

I didn't think you usually called ac97 directly.

Oh, and BTW, Slackware 9.1 defaults to ALSA sound by default now.  Alsa
modules use the snd- format for their modules.  You might check the Alsa
Soundcard Matrix for your motherboard (or its chip) and see what alsa
module to use, although if you installed hotplug I would have expected
it to have been automagically loaded for you.

Yes, Debian is PITA to install. And as cool as apt, dpkg, dselect, and 
synaptic are, there's a learning curve. I think a "medium Linux skills" user 
would do fine, if they were willing to take the time, and could find the 
documentation. There are boatloads of user documentation, though it may take 
a bit of digging to find it. Look on debian.org, and look on your own system- 
there are docs and manuals squirreled away all over the place, in 
/usr/share/doc, and various other locations. Think of it as treasure hunt. :)

Prettied-up Debians are a good way to get started. I use Libranet, 2.8.1 is 
Sarge-based. Latest and greatest of everything. Just as good is Knoppix, 
which can also be installed to a hard drive.

You got that right! I spent the afternoon trying to restore a boogered system 
file on a non-booting Win2k. There is absolutely nothing (that I know of) in 
the windows world that is equivalent to Knoppix, or the SuperRescue CD, or 
Tom's Root Boot. The Windows "rescue disk" is four fricken floppy disks, and 
they do little that is useful. I finally fixed it with Knoppix, and I did not 
have to reformat and reinstall the whole damned works, which is the preferred 
method for all minor windoze fixes, and all my data and configs were 
undisturbed. (Just one little system file! gaaahh!)

This article was a great help for fixing my #$%$# Winduhs system with Knoppix,

FWIW, I don't see Debian doing very much that Gentoo doesn't do....

Conversely, I suppose Gentoo doesn't do a lot Debian doesn't do....

I like Gentoo a lot, though.  I think I like it about even with
Slackware for the desktop, and two or three notches down for a server.

Knoppix is the bomb.  :-)

Anybody heard if they have cloop working with 2.6.0-test yet?

If you're confident using mostly non-GUI utilities, LNX-BBC is way super
cool as a rescue disk.  I just used it to rescue a computer infected
with <insert latest virus here> in no time flat.  Just fired it up,
selected a safe kernel (this box doesn't like default 2.4.x kernels -
oh, I modified LNX-BBC to support multiple kernels, too...), scp'd
f-prot over from my server, and had it scan the hard drive.  VERY
simple.

LNX-BBC utilizes the cloop module like Knoppix does... it's a lot like
Knoppix, I think, without all the jazzy desktop stuff.  I was able to
get links -g on there, running in X, though.  By default it comes with
Browsex for X browsing and lynx and links for console browsing.  The
latest CVS (which just recently started booting, I understand) actually
includes Mozilla Firebird as a graphical browser.

All that fits on a 50MB CD.

I can't think of a better rescue disk than that.  :-)

Is there an install script/program for the latest Gentoo?  I'd like to

A script, like you just boot with the CD and type install?  No, Gentoo
is a bit too personalized for something like that to work too
effectively.

http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-x86-install.xml

..pretty much lays out what to do.  Give it a few hours and you'll have
a workable system.

If by 'futz around' you mean try things until something works.. there
isn't a lot of that involved, it's pretty much laid out and you
shouldn't have too many problems.  :-)

By "script" I meant an install script where it would ask you questions 
and you'd give it answers, and it would perform the actual operations 
for you.  I doubt that Gentoo's level of personalization precludes this; 
but if none exist then none exist.

I suppose by "futz around"  I mean follow the ~160KB of instructions at 
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-x86-install.xml.. ugh, I'm lazy.

I did just find http://glis.sourceforge.net/ though, I might give that a 
spin.

I don't usually like taking input in a script like that (IMHO that's
what C/C++ is for) ... so always consider that a program... even when
it's written in bash.  :-)

No, I guess there isn't an official gentoo installation program.

Hey, that looks pretty neat.  :-)

I'd give it a spin, but run Slackware on all my other machines.  And, by
the nature of Gentoo, I'll never need to totally reinstall (I half did
that once, removed almost all the packages and rebuilt from scratch).

There are a half dozen attempts at one though. You can take a look at
them via viewcvs:

you're only assigning every other element of COL1 and COL2.
COL1[0] has a value, COL1[1] is null, COL1[2] has a value, etc.

Most other comments agreed with, I have to disagree with these.

The biggest problem I have with any "snapshot" (and I consider RH9 a
snapshot) is the same thing as a technology freeze on the Space Shuttle
program.  Yes it help with the process (the shuttle must freeze 10 years
out sometimes), but in the computing world, it does not make sense.

For example, RH9 comes with Mozilla 1.2.x.  Mozilla was at 1.3 when it
came out, and 1.4 before I ever installed it.  Now Ximian desktop (XD2)
uses moz 1.4.x but it screws the history files.  Largely since XD2
favors galeon, it has not cared too much about its mozilla failures.
Mozilla 1.5.x is now out and no movement from ximian is evident to me.


So what I hope out of fedora is a way of avoiding this.  To be honest, I
am not so sure.  The usual arguments against Redhat from the debian and
gentoo crowds fall flat since they suffer from this technology lag as
well. (are you serious that stable used 2.2.x?).

Yes I could compile/download my own.  But I have clients.  Multiplied
out, I have to react for over 1000 machines.  Often they need similar
latest thingies (Mozilla being #1).  Having binary packages I can send
is critical.  Better yet, binaries that they can download from someone
else.  Having to build my own binaries is tedious and usually
troublesome.  Hell just getting 2 sony laptops working the same (while
they are CPUs and years apart, both have small HD space) is enough pain.

I'm pretty sure the default stable install uses the latest 2.2.x, but
there's a number of 2.4.x kernel packages in the stable tree.

I use the 2.4bf stable netinst images which use the trimmed down 2.4 "boot
floppies" kernel.

Perhaps you should consider maintaining a simple Zot apt-source for your
clients.  It'd probably just be a matter of making simple back-ports for
those few packages that you'd like to keep updated beyond that which is in
stable.

FWIW, I am seeing this being more and more common in Gentoo, but I think
they still have a decent balance.  They aren't near as out of balance as
Debian-stable has gotten to be.  The current kernel is (was?) 2.4.20
with Gentoo.

The only Gentoo packages I find myself constantly upgrading to ~x86 (the
beta versions) are gaim and alsa.  Most of the others keep up well
enough for me.

It is easy enough to work with these few Beta packages for me, though.

Just my two cents.

Rob

I've always had this inuition that Debian-like infrastructure could
solve this problem for you.  You cache debian packages (swiped from
Debian archives or built yourself if necessary) that you have tested
and vouch for for your clients, and have the sources.list on your 1000
machines point at your tested cache.  Then, either update via a cron
or some other automated mechanism, e.g., roughly:

  for h in $host-list ; do
    ssh -l root $h 'apt-get update ; apt-get dist-upgrade'
  done

I don't know how well this would work in practice, but seems plausible
enough to be worthy of further exploration.  Alas, I manage
considerably fewer than 1000 machines, and at my scale it doesn't look
worth the effort.

Zot> Better yet, binaries that they can download from someone else.

That part might be tricky.

Running an older version always makes sense when you don't have the
resources to properly stage the upgrade.

Add one more line to /etc/rc.sysinit just after those two lines:

chown [uid]:[uid] /tmp/mbox

Now it works, and yes I've rebooted and tested it.  :)

Rob,

  Yes it's odd. At the clinic Dan helped me identify what drivers are needed
for the built-in sound chip so why they would not load when I brought the
system back is particularly strange.

  In my original message I noted that I tried 'modprobe ac97.o.gz' and
presented what came back. Heh! Just now I logged into that system ane ran
'lsmod'. No soundcord module either today. Let me try loading the specific
modules again ...

# modprobe ac97.o.gz
modeprobe: Can't locate module ac97.o.gz

# locate ac97.o.gz
/lib/modules/2.4.22/kernel/drivers/sound/ac97.o.gz

  To write that I'm puzzled, perplexed and out of my knowledge set is an
understatement.

  The motherboard is a MSI KT3 Ultra2 (MS-6380E v1.X with the VIA Apollo
KT333 and VT8235 chipsets. The audio chip is a Realtek ALC650. Neither
Realtek nor ALC650 is listed on the alsa soundcard matrix page.

Brian, Rob, et al.:

  For rc.nfsd the script does explicitly support 'stop', 'start' and
'restart'. But, neither rc.inet1 nor rc.inet2 have this ability.

  Many of the rc.modules can be explicitly stopped, started and restarted a
la Red Hat, but I see nothing for taking the network down and up. I have
found it necessary to do this when one host is powered down for maintenance
(or when power goes off in the neighborhood). The network seems to need this
manual intervention to resync and work well again.

Thanks,

Rich

Hey people -

   I've got a custom driver that I need to use for
video 4 linux.  It's installation instructions tell me
to recompile the kernel.  Do I have to do this?  BTTV
loads as a module, so isn't there some other *easier*
way?

Thanks,

As a recent Debian convert, I know of what you speak. I've got my base
install routine down.

1) Pop in the Woody CDs 
2) type bf24 at the boot prompt (to install with a 2.4 kernel)
3) upon finish of the stable install, replace "stable" with "testing"
or "unstable" in /etc/apt/sources.list
4) apt-get update && apt-get -u dist-upgrade

After slurping much bandwidth, I've got my updated machine.

I've converted converted six machines from redhat so far ranging from
servers running stable to laptops running unstable. One idea of debian
I really like is the "perpetual upgrade". With the updating/upgrading
process I can upgrade my system without a reboot (of course to running
a new kernel requires a reboot).

BTW, I've come to like "aptitude" better than that apt-get
suite. Check it out :-)

I haven't been keeping up with Red Hat, I threw in the towel when they
came out with RH9 so soon after 8, changed the libraries and then
started this Fedora migration.

I'd like to know if these core releases will require downing the machine,
inserting the CD, upgrading and then rebooting.

The default install of the current Debian stable (Woody) uses a 2.2
kernel. However, just typing "bf24" installs a 2.4 kernel during the
install. IIRC, Woody came out in July of 2002 so at that time 2.2 was
considered stable and I guess the 2.4 kernel just wasn't tested enough
to be the default. Testing is supposed to be taking Woody's place near
the end of this year.

My understanding of the Debian process is that what you talk about is
why there are the three versions, stable for the servers/production
machines, testing for those who need more current packages, and
unstable for those who like to be up on the cutting edge. There are
ways to have a stable box and install testing or unstable packages on
it. I'm not far enough in my understanding to comment on that, maybe
someone else can describe the art of "pinning".

I use unstable at home and on my laptop and I must say, it is pretty
stable. I've only had two times in the last six months where an
upgrade has stymied me. And a quick trip to the IRC channel fixed
those.

This depends of how the BTTV driver uses the kernel.  If it has to patch
the kernel code, as opposed to just compiling a module, then you will
have to compile your kernel.

>   BTTV

Again, that depends on whether or not the driver has to make changes to
the kernel source, or just read the kernel configuration.  The only way
to find this out is to look at the driver source.

The most likely (and least frustrating) way to get this device to work
is to follow the instructions.  They were probably designed to work with
a large variety of systems.

Sometimes you can get away with just downloading the header files for
the kernel that you already have running, but if that is not in the
instructions, you won't know how to compile the module against these
headers.

Good Luck,

This usually happens when the kernel has been recompiled, but the

  No apologies necessary, Carla. The book is the first place I looked. If
the information is there I missed seeing it. I've used the book for help in
manually setting up the network and for remembering the exact syntax of the
pkgtool (singular, not plural) and for a few other things. But I didn't see
anything there about starting and stopping services, only a large
introduction to many common *nix utilities.

  I'm using the stock kernel that was installed with 9.1. Although, ... I
may well have inadvertently messed things up when I compiled a custom kernel

I am still confused about why this is necessary.  You said something
at the clinic that you were cross-mounting NFS.  If that's all that is
being sync'd, then just an /etc/mumble/nfsd restart is all that should
be needed.  I don't understand what else one machine would depend on
the other for.

This should correct the creation of the column arrays.

I'm kind of shocked nobody has written this yet, but modprobe takes a
module name, not a filename.

Here's an example fromy my machine:

[root:~]#rmmod mga_vid
[root:~]#locate mga_vid
/lib/modules/2.4.18/kernel/drivers/misc/mga_vid.o
/usr/lib/mplayer/vidix/mga_vid.so
[root:~]#modprobe mga_vid.o
modprobe: Can't locate module mga_vid.o
[root:~]#modprobe mga_vid
[root:~]#lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
mga_vid                 8400   0  (unused)

See?  Just type the right thing and the right thing can happen.

Being RedHat centric I am not sure what startup routines you use for
your distribution, but you can fall back on ifconfig.  This is the basic
network configuration tool.  ifconfig <interface> up <ipaddress> netmask

VIA VT8235 is, however... try following the steps on this page (noting
you have Alsa 0.9.6 or 0.9.7 on there)...

Really, all you need to worry about is loading the proper module, you
don't need to worry about setting up a proper .asoundrc.

Unfortunately, The Good Book, as it is often called, is far far out of
date.

There's a project to renew it, but I don't think we have ALSA
information in there just yet.  It's been pretty much written around
9.0... and differences between 9.0 and 9.1 as far as configuration is
concerned pretty much is just Alsa being included now, I think.

Ahh - if you recompile your kernel, you're going to need to either
un-blacklist the OSS modules in the hotplug settings, wherever that
is... or re-install the alsa package (preferably from source, although
reinstalling it from the binary package should work, too).

Russell,

  If I don't need to stop and start network services, just nfs, then I'm
happy and won't pursue this further. In the past I've restarted both.
Perhaps I didn't need to do so.

Thanks,

It's been a while since I've used NFS, but maybe all you really need
to do is to umount/mount the nfs mounts on the client side.  You don't
need to wait until the next power failure to find out, just reboot one
of the machines and see what's necessary.

Naw. Just upgrade the fedora-release package and "yum update" or
"apt-get dist-upgrade" or "up2date -u". Perhaps restart services for
glibc updates.

I've gone from Severn Beta -> FC test 1 -> FC test 2 -> FC test 3 by
that route, rebooting only for new kernel packages (of which there
have been many, mostly ACPI or exec-shield fixes, I think).

The "defining characteristic" of Fedora Core 2 is expected to be the
2.6 kernel, so I'd plan on at least one reboot for that upgrade. ;-)

In my work environment, the core questions in this regard are
customization and reliance. I haven't worked this out completely, but
I think my assertions would be something like this:

* The more customization we do to an application, the more stable we
  want it to be.

* The more we rely on an application's current behavior -- esp. w.r.t.
  its predictability and uptime -- the more stable we want it to be. A
  related issue is the number of people who rely on the behavior: the
  more users involved, the more consistency is needed.

The obverse would be something like

* Applications we use "out of the box," that don't need rock-solid
  uptime and predictability -- those we want to see upgraded in a
  timely manner.

To my way of thinking, that puts different types of systems and
applications in need of different upgrade architectures:

* Application servers: At work, we host a number of key applications
  on Linux servers that don't allow user logins: sendmail, Mailman,
  Squid, OpenLDAP, stunnel, SquirrelMail, Apache, Samba, and NFS.

  Each of those applications is subject to a certain amount of
  customization for our enviroment. They also need to interact with
  other key applications (e.g., Perl, PHP, libdb, glibc, OpenSSL) in
  very, very predictable ways. Otherwise, things break for lots of
  people all at once.

  These machines really benefit from what you call the "snapshot"
  approach. For example, even incremental upgrades to PHP can throw
  SquirrelMail into a tizzy. I don't want continuous upgrades to these
  applications. I want them stable and predictable. Hopefully, the
  servers hosting these applications can keep a stable OS
  configuration for at least two years.

* Login servers: We have a couple other Linux login servers used for
  students, researchers, and faculty to compile/test/run applications
  for class and research projects.

  Custom-built applications can be very sensitive to changes in
  development libraries, glibc and, esp. compilers.

  Typically, I can provide a couple machines to serve in this role.
  That allows folks to test their apps in the new environment,
  rebuilding them if necessary.

  Still, there needs to be a fairly long life for these boxes. We have
  researchers whose NSF grants rely on demos they build and run on
  these hosts. Again, even incremental upgrades can be problematic.

* Desktops: We also have a number of desktop hosts. These are good
  candidates for the small, continuous upgrades provided by, e.g.,
  Debian testing or Gentoo. If something breaks or changes, the
  individual user can usually be fairly flexible.

Different environments have different needs, of course, and I don't
want to suggest that my environment is indicative of all others.

Still, there are very few of my backroom servers that I'd trust to a
distribution that was continually upgrading its apps or libraries. The
backporting approach taken by Red Hat is more to my liking.

On the desktop, however, the continuous upgrades make more sense in
many situations.

Good deal. Is up2date getting better about restarting services when
you upgrade? A friend of mine found out the hard way with the slapper
virus. openssl was updated but apache wasn't restarted.

I think this has come up on the list before, with the rational for not
restarting services automatically being that you can schedule the
downtime (however brief) if done manually.

Most of Redhat's security advisory end with a statement like: "After
the errata packages are installed, restart the Web service by running
(as root) the following command: /sbin/service httpd restart"

Also, say my web servers have passphrases on the SSL certificates. If
httpd restarts, I have to re-enter the passphrase, which will be
difficult to do if it's a 2AM scheduled upgrade via RHN, etc.

I agree-

Restarting services (as well as installing patches, IMHO) should be the
job of System Administrator and not something like Up2Date...

But, that's just my opinion.

I don't like my computers thinking for themselves too much.

Subject: [PLUG] Curiosity about redirect and source route...
Message-ID: <1066624076.26459.55.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I recently found out about sysctl -a which shows all keys and 
their settings.  For some reason, a RH 6.2 server wasn't 
masquerading anymore.  I found all the source_route and 
icmp_redirect keys were set to 1.  Is there any reason to 
accept or send icmp redirects?  Is there any reason to 
accept or send source routed packets?  I don't know why 
turning source routing and redirect off allowed me to go 
out again.  There's no proxy on the box.

Just as a precaution, I downed my outside interface and 
changed the passwords.  Oddly though, Redhat by default 
seems to accept redirects and source routed packets.  
Isn't the route protection filter supposed to change 
this behavior?  Something must have gotten screwed up.

I kept getting packets rejected every time I tried to go out 
which doesn't make sense unless my firewall catch all was 
kicking in for some reason.  Maybe I should grep the init 
files for sysctl and echo lines.

I thought it was the firewall at first , so I know that's fine.

There are some known bugs in rpm with locking and rpm.  What version of 
Red Hat are you using?  For RH8.0, make sure you have the most recent 
available version of rpm, 4.1.1.  For RH9, some people suggest the 
experimental release 4.2-1 from ftp.rpm.org or Fedora.  Also, you want 
the most recent version of apt, 0.5.5cnc6.  Finally, check for duplicate 
glibc packages because old bugs would cause the updates to fail and not 
remove the old versions.

I am running RH9 and haven't had any problems recently after upgrading apt.

Just to throw my two cents in the mix..... I have not had one single ounce
of problems with customers who install ActionTec modems from Qwest.  It
takes a maximum of five minutes start to finish.  Plug the phone line into
the modem, plug the computers into the built in switch, power it on, open up
http://192.168.0.1 and then click basic setup.  If Qwest has finished the
line provisioning and your ISP is half way decent, you're done.

No you don't get your 3 mbits/sec download speed as you do with cable, but
who needs to download their email super fast anyways......

Subject: [PLUG] Looking for people to help form Open Source classes at Saturday
 Academy
Message-ID: <1066670408.24559.21.camel@kat>

We are looking for people to help discuss (we are just probing at this
time) Open Source classes at Saturday Academy.  The blurb:

        This is for the Partnership for Kids and Saturday Academy to
        discuss Open Source classes.  It not about open sourcing the
        classes, nor about teaching open source in other venues.  The
        goal is to create a workable curriculum for Saturday Academy
        (www.saturdayacademy.org).


So this has a few takes:  classes about Open Source, classes that use
Open Source products, and frankly classes that get Marketing Value from
the term Open Source (remember the target age is 9-17 or so).

If you are interested in joining the discussion email me directly.  This
will start as a mail list and evolve into meetings and other venues. 
Largely we are trying to gain a critical mass of people to talk about,
and explain Open Source to the Saturday Academy people, who are pushing
this.

 yes.

 Download and burn the cd33.iso (or if you wait a couple weeks the cd34.iso)
or get the floppys to boot with, or even buy the distro - your choice.

 Install the OS, detailed nicely here:

OpenBSD has a great reputation for security, however you might want to 
check out the benchmark site that was posted earlier:

http://bulk.fefe.de/scalability/

OpenBSD came out on the bottom of these tests (Linux 2.6 and FreeBSD 5.1 
came out on top).  (though in practice for 
home use you'll probably never hit these sorts of loads)

I installed OpenBSD on an old PC a year or so ago and while it was more 
work than a Linux install, it wasn't that bad.  Kind of reminded me of 
installing Linux back in '96.

Phil,

  I did look at the site. For a SOHO installation I don't think that's an
issue. From everything I've read OpenBSD is the ultimate in paranoid
security so I think that's ideal for a firewall.

  OTOH, the floppyfw has served me well for almost 4.5 years now. I'd just
like to do more filtering of spam and other junk at the firewall rather than
only at the MTA.

Yep, though on a sparc, not an x86 box. I can probably provide some
assistance with the pf rules.

Subject: [PLUG] Ahh, mostly figured out my firewall problems...
Message-ID: <1066674077.8081.9.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I wanted to be able to nmap a gateway from another one going into
the same public subnet.  I made this possible by allowing the
other gateway to probe ports 1 to 65535, though it took a little
thought to come up with that. Figuring out I had to allow the
output to go back took watching the log.  The other mistake I
made was to add my web browsing chains to themselves instead 
of to input and output.  Couldn't figure out why I could get
dns but couldn't web browse.

Now that I have my two gateways working again, I'm still at 
a loss on how to get my clients to dynamically receive two 
routers at two different metrics and switch when the primary 
is off to the secondary without zebra or some other dynamic
protocol.  If I manually configure a Redhat box, I can use 
two static routes to implement two default gateways at 
different metrics.  BTW, does anyone know where a document 
that explains the syntax of that file is?  I hope this
doesn't involve manual configuration of Windows.  Can
dhcp3 distribute multiple routers with multiple metrics?

What system are you running?  If redhat there are ways to do this using

You mean Ultrasparc as OBSD doesn't run on sparc, AFAICT

I think it would be easier for you to enhance your floppyfw
firewall rules than to learn another OS/firewall platform.
It would certainly take less time - time that you need to
spend on your book.

Ed,

  That's certainly true. I've considered the situation and the new firewall
is well down the road in priority. :-)

I do happen to run it on an ultrasparc (sunblade 100), but we've got
openbsd running on a couple old sparcstation 10s in the cube next to
me here at work.

I just "added" ntfs to a few RH9 systems.  

You still need all the tools for kernel compile.  This just saves a
bunch of time, reduces other issues, and makes it portable (like to
systems that do not have compile tools on them).

The steps are along these lines:
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=ntfs+compile+redhat+rpm&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&selm=k5af7.17274%24ZM2.1534623%40newsread2.prod.itd.earthlink.net&rnum=2

http://linuxexperience.com/tutorials/redhatntfs.php

The tricks:

Incstall the kernel src.rpm for your kernel (must match).   For me:
rpm -qa | grep kernel
kernel-2.4.20-20.9
kernel-2.4.20-8
kernel-utils-2.4-8.29
kernel-module-alsa-0.9.6-1.fr_2.4.20_20.9
kernel-pcmcia-cs-3.1.31-13
kernel-source-2.4.20-20.9

 uname -a
Linux kat 2.4.20-20.9 #1 Mon Aug 18 11:45:58 EDT 2003 i686 i686 i386
GNU/Linux


So 2.4.20-20.9 is the latest and running:

Then cd /usr/src/linux
  make mrproper
This cleans things up
  make xconfig
Pick "Load Configuration from file", choose the matching CPU flag, for
me, configs/kernel-2.4.20-i686.config

Select the appropriate flags in the kernel config areas.  Make sure they
are modules.

save and exit

edit the Makefile
Remove "Custom" from the EXTRAVERSION line

  make dep
  make modules SUBDIRS=fs/ntfs

The SUBDIRS is for ntfs.  Figure out what you need for bttv.  This saves
a lot of time.

  mkdir  /lib/modules/KERNELVERSION/kernel/fs/ntfs

again change fs/ntfs to whatever you need.  Likely you do not need to.

  cp /usr/src/linux-2.4.20-13.9/fs/ntfs/ntfs.o /lib/modules/2.4.20-13.9/kernel/fs/ntfs
  chmod 0644 /lib/modules/2.4.20-13.9/kernel/fs/ntfs/ntfs.o

Change the kernel versions as appropriate.

    /sbin/depmod -a

Once the file is built and chmoded you drop it on any RH9 machine with
the same kernel.  Most of the problems I had was failure to follow the
steps in order.

I have done this technique a bunch and it works well.  I wish redhat
would just make rpms/tars of the built kernel trees so you could just
drop in the new code and recompile, but this is close enough.

Email to FAX gateway?  Sure.  It's gonna involve HylaFAX and maybe some
Perl.  Hrm, let's see what T.F.W. says...

http://www.hylafax.org/howto/faxing.html#ss5.4

 5.4 Email-To-Fax Configuration
  * faxmail - faxmail is a HylaFAX client program which takes an electronic
    mail message on standard input and converts it to PostScript in a form
    that is suitable for transmission as a facsimile. Read the man page:
    faxmail(1). In order to use faxmail as an email-to-fax gateway,
    typically some degree of "sendmail mangling" must be done. See
    http://www.hylafax.org/howto/clients/sendmail-faxmail-mangling.html and
    http://www.hylafax.org/howto/clients/faxmail-nonrandom-host.html for
    more information.
  * email-to-fax with procmail - If procmail is your mail delivery agent
    (MDA), then you can easily configure it to handle outbound faxes by
    setting up a dedicated user account for faxing out and placing
    appropriate recipes in that user's $HOME/.procmailrc file. Outbound
    faxes are then e-mailed to this user account. This is how the
    above-mentioned RelayFax client works, which already has a simple
    generic email-to-fax capability built-in.

It's a shame more folks don't know about HylaFAX.  Heck, I'd run it
myself, if I had a modem, a land-line and a need to handle FAXes.
Maybe it'll get more popular now that Windows no longer comes with
FAXing.  Just another job for your friendly li'l SOHO Linux box...

Just go here and get the RPM and install the kernel module from RPM:

I did this last nite so I could read a NTFS hard drive on my RH 9 system and 
it worked fine.

This is close to what I want. I have an information document that potential customers call me for. When there's 
nobody in the office (which hap[pens whenever I'm gone) I'd like to be able to prompt my workstation to send out 
this document. Most of the people who call do not have internet access (hence the FAX)

The system would ideally strip the FAX number out of the e-mail and dial that number, sending the FAX.

Ya know, I've been hankering for a few bizcard-sized CDs.  Is there
anyone who sells 'em in single quantity?  If not, anyone interested in
splitting a pack?

Keith (who very graciously gives away the "Dr Bronner" Knoppix CDs at

like something wallet-sized for those inevitible MacGyver moments.

Be Prepared,

Yes, but please follow the thread or change the subject line.  The
question was on compiling new V4L drivers a dealing with bttv, not
ntfs.  The question was "can I compile new modules without compile a new
kernel."

I used ntfs as an example.  Feel free to post helpful links in the
correct thread, it makes searching so much easier for people.

BTW the ntfs site really should have the instructions for compiling rpm
compliant modules since they do it themselves.  I tried to find it on
there and they have two set of instructions:

1)  Compile your own full kernel.
2)  Use our rpms.

They are the prime example of a device you might want to not use the
stock ntfs module.  They have made some upgrades to the ntfs module. 
Instead they have a you run a script which does a bunch of odd things,
whereas the listed steps are pretty straight forward.

I'll split a pack with you if you wish.  Fry's had some good deals a
month or three back on them, I still have six left from the first pack,
and twenty five in the second pack.  IIRC, the packs were around $10 or
so.  Way more expensive than a regular CD-R, but still within reason,
IMHO.

Anyway, if you go buy a pack before the next PLUG meeting, I'll buy
however many you don't want at a proper ratio, assuming the price is
within reason (I wouldn't want to spend more than $.50 a CD, I think).

I don't use a GUI for rescue type things anyway... might as well not use
a CD that wastes a ton of space for GUI stuff.  :-)

Although, I did just boot up with Knoppix to verify a video issue I'm
having (another post to follow, I think)... it was pretty and fairly
full-featured, although I really wish they would have thought to include
mplayer in there instead of xine.

I don't want to promote any stores or what not, but I just did a project
around this. 
Compusa has a 25 pack for around $15, which isn't exactly a major
investment. 
Laserquick (kinkos didn't iirc) will label them in full color for about $20
for 50 business cards (quite good quality). If you want them to burn data
for you, they will charge an arm and a leg and take forever but the labels
do look quite sharp, and I'm sure you can even have them print a swiss army
knife on the cards. Whatever ;)
I have a couple blank cdr spares if you're interested.

As long as we aren't promoting things (Plugging:) There is a new printer

Epson has had some others that do so, but this looks like it will sell for
less than $200 and have separate ink cartridges for all 6 colors. It also
does text printing much faster than its predecessors. It'll be out VERY
soon.

Does vmstat 2 give you any clues.  Could be a blocked task somewhere.

Keep in mind that unless you're creating some huge corporate firewall 
for 1000s of people, OpenBSD is more than adequate for most peoples 
needing a small firewall. I've used OpenBSD as my firewall of choice 
since 2.9. I don't care about scalability and this isn't a real 
priority for the OpenBSD team either. Adding security and other 
features does take a performance hit but IMHO it's worth it for the 
added security features.

I have a set of "pf" rules I use for my network and I also use "isakmpd" 
for a VPN tunnel to the office where we use a small Netgear FVS318 
VPN/Firewall appliance for our office firewall. I'm looking forward to 
converting our office firewall over to a dual-homed OpenBSD system when 
we have more room in our sever rack for another 1U box. The Netgear 
appliance is nice and all but we're finding we need a bit more 
flexibility that what it provides.

OpenBSD still supports the 386 so I've found it ideal for putting my 12 
year old 486DX33 back into service as a print server in our office for 
our parallel-port only HP laserjet. It's a text-based install with 
text-based configuration files and I find it very easy to install and 
configure. I keep my configuration files in configuration management so 
I can slap them onto a new OpenBSD install and have a working system 
very quickly. It reminds me of Slackware installs I did 7+ years ago. 
It's not flashy but it works and anyone that understands the basics of 
system configuration and doesn't mind using "vi" should be able get 
OpenBSD installed and running IMHO.

Yes, I haven't had any issues with it since the protocol change.

The GAIM devs worked on the code for a long time, and had it down pat, I
think, before it was released.

What kind of errors are you getting?  What distro are you using?

I couldn't agree more - OpenBSD 2.8 was one of the first linux/unix installs
I ever did - it was easy, the documents online totally handhold you thru the
process (yes, it definitely helps to have two computers - one that you're
installing on, and one that you can get onto the web with - or print the
pages to hardcopy) and provide enough information that you can get up to
speed and managing things on your own in a short period of time.  And, the
online help has only gotten better over the last couple years...

Since we will not be having a Plug meeting Thursday January 1 2004,
may I suggest a small schedule change, perhaps another party for
those of you with a few bottles left over from New Years?

On Tuesday, January 6, 2004, Linus Torvalds will be 2^30 seconds
old.  Depending on time of day he was born on December 28, 1969
in Helsinki, + 3 hrs 37 minutes to PST.

On Saturday, January 10, 2004, at 0537PST the Epoch of Unix
(starting January 1, 1970 UTC) will be 2^30 seconds old.  

A party spanning both these times would be quite an event ... :-)


BTW, On November 2, 2004, Beaverton, Oregon (platted December 26,
1868), the home town of the Open Source Development Labs ( Linus's
employer) will be 2^32 seconds old.  With luck, it will do like an
unsigned int32, roll over, and turn into a swamp again. :-)

Your list is neat. One note: Helsinki is UTC+3 (daylight) and thus 10

If you don't mind finding a use for the extra space, why not go for the
185 MB CD-RWs? I bought a pack of 5 at Target (IIRC) for less than $20.--.
They're the physical size of a 3.5 inch floppy, case & all. I'm amazed
at how computer technology changes when I blink.

And if someone wants to pipe up about USB flash memory devices, maybe
you should change the subject line of the followup -- just to keep one or

The gentoo installation is very straightforward, no futzing required.  The only real time requirement is for compilations.

But, getting it to work with certain hardware does involve research, especially things like direct 3D rendering and ACPI support for laptops.  Fortunately, what the user doc's do not cover is made up for in the forums.  The online support is, in fact, one of the best things about gentoo.

For what it's worth,

Yes, I use them for the config files on gibraltar firewalls.  Once the
system is setup for the client, I then copy the config files from the
USB storage device to the clients winblows box.  I've successfully
copied them back as well.  Linux can repartition them as well, and as
long as you leave some sort of FAT file system, winblows will be able to
read and write to it.  FYI, 2k and XP don't (usually) need drivers, but
'98 almost always needs drivers.

Subject: [PLUG] Rsync Backup Solution over SSH
Message-ID: <1066756533.6430.63.camel@sparticus>

All,

Here's the scenario: you need a backup solution that will make a
complete backup of your server and automatically rotate the backup
snapshots using rsync.

These two scripts will take a snapshot once every four hours (depending
on your crontab entry) and automatically rotate the snapshots
"backward," that is, 'hourly.3' will be deleted, 'hourly.2' will rotate
to 'hourly.3,' 'hourly.1' will rotate to 'hourly.2' and so on. 

Moreover, a snapshot of the server will be taken and the three "dailys"
will rotate in a similar fashion to the "hourlys" at midnight each day.

Here is an excellent article for doing this:

  http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/library/i-metro17.html

 Why rsync? From the article:

* rsync is fast, stable, and mature; it's been around for years and has
served the author well in a multitude of diverse situations.

* rsync was designed to do exactly what we were trying to do -- create
an exact replica of a local data repository on a remote system (or
visa-versa), and keep the two repositories in "sync" with each other.

* rsync is readily available; it ships with most popular Linux
distributions.

While Tom's article is excellent, there's just one catch: this article
talks about performing synchronized backups when an NFS mount is
available. For security reasons NFS was in my case simply not an option.

I adapted the scripts to work via SSH.

Alert: Automating the scripts via cron requires that root on the origin
server be able to log in to the remote server via SSH without a
password. Of course, the origin server must still authenticate itself
with public/private key authentication. The best way to do this securely
is outlined here:

  http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-keyc3/

For your convenience, here is the beginning of the SSH article here:

  http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-keyc.html
  
 To implement the system, perform the following:

1) Install the Korne Shell (ksh) if you do not already have it

2) Copy both hourly_snapshot.sh and daily_snapshot.sh to /usr/bin

3) Configure the origin server to log in as root via SSH without a
password

4) Create a file called /etc/excludes (example below) and add the
directories and/or files you do not wish to back up

5) Modify the REMOTE_SERVER variable in both scripts to point to the
server that will receive the backups and make them executable by root
(chmod 744 /usr/bin/script_name.sh)

6) Modify the SNAPSHOT_RW variable in both scripts to point to the
directory on the remote server you wish the system to backup to

7) Add the following to your crontab: 

  0 */4 * * * /usr/bin/hourly_snapshot.sh
  0 0 * * * /usr/bin/daily_snapshot.sh

Since the scripts are so small I have attached them. I hope you will
forgive me as sending the information as a small file increases the
likelihood of correctness in terms of line breaks, etc. As I mentioned,
an example /etc/excludes file is also included.

I wrote the script for the Korne shell. Why? <\start flame here\>
because ksh is the Cadillac of all shells. It has air conditioning and
power steering. In short, it makes writing scripts really nice.

However, if any of you would like to modify this for Bash, please let me
know; I would be very interested to have that.

I hope you find these scripts useful.


Very Truly Yours,
--

I tried out the GLIS program, it's not what I was hoping for - right now

waiting for a front end.

Their instructions are good and quite straightforward I think, but for a

We are finding that having a NetApp with hourly snapshots to be a step
above that.

However, the key question to the Rsync process is the reverse process.

suppose that your host is compromised or other wise damaged and
you want to rebuild your system from scratch. What is the path for 
restore from the rsync set up?


Do you have a recipe for that?

 % 
 % All,
 % 
 % Here's the scenario: you need a backup solution that will make a
 % complete backup of your server and automatically rotate the backup
 % snapshots using rsync.
 % 
 % These two scripts will take a snapshot once every four hours (depending
 % on your crontab entry) and automatically rotate the snapshots
 % "backward," that is, 'hourly.3' will be deleted, 'hourly.2' will rotate
 % to 'hourly.3,' 'hourly.1' will rotate to 'hourly.2' and so on. 
 % 
 % Moreover, a snapshot of the server will be taken and the three "dailys"
 % will rotate in a similar fashion to the "hourlys" at midnight each day.
 % 
 % Here is an excellent article for doing this:
 % 
 %   http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/library/i-metro17.html
 % 
 %  Why rsync? From the article:
 % 
 % * rsync is fast, stable, and mature; it's been around for years and has
 % served the author well in a multitude of diverse situations.
 % 
 % * rsync was designed to do exactly what we were trying to do -- create
 % an exact replica of a local data repository on a remote system (or
 % visa-versa), and keep the two repositories in "sync" with each other.
 % 
 % * rsync is readily available; it ships with most popular Linux
 % distributions.
 % 
 % While Tom's article is excellent, there's just one catch: this article
 % talks about performing synchronized backups when an NFS mount is
 % available. For security reasons NFS was in my case simply not an option.
 % 
 % I adapted the scripts to work via SSH.
 % 
 % Alert: Automating the scripts via cron requires that root on the origin
 % server be able to log in to the remote server via SSH without a
 % password. Of course, the origin server must still authenticate itself
 % with public/private key authentication. The best way to do this securely
 % is outlined here:
 % 
 %   http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-keyc3/
 % 
 % For your convenience, here is the beginning of the SSH article here:
 % 
 %   http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-keyc.html
 %   
 %  To implement the system, perform the following:
 % 
 % 1) Install the Korne Shell (ksh) if you do not already have it
 % 
 % 2) Copy both hourly_snapshot.sh and daily_snapshot.sh to /usr/bin
 % 
 % 3) Configure the origin server to log in as root via SSH without a
 % password
 % 
 % 4) Create a file called /etc/excludes (example below) and add the
 % directories and/or files you do not wish to back up
 % 
 % 5) Modify the REMOTE_SERVER variable in both scripts to point to the
 % server that will receive the backups and make them executable by root
 % (chmod 744 /usr/bin/script_name.sh)
 % 
 % 6) Modify the SNAPSHOT_RW variable in both scripts to point to the
 % directory on the remote server you wish the system to backup to
 % 
 % 7) Add the following to your crontab: 
 % 
 %   0 */4 * * * /usr/bin/hourly_snapshot.sh
 %   0 0 * * * /usr/bin/daily_snapshot.sh
 % 
 % Since the scripts are so small I have attached them. I hope you will
 % forgive me as sending the information as a small file increases the
 % likelihood of correctness in terms of line breaks, etc. As I mentioned,
 % an example /etc/excludes file is also included.
 % 
 % I wrote the script for the Korne shell. Why? <\start flame here\>
 % because ksh is the Cadillac of all shells. It has air conditioning and
 % power steering. In short, it makes writing scripts really nice.
 % 
 % However, if any of you would like to modify this for Bash, please let me
 % know; I would be very interested to have that.
 % 
 % I hope you find these scripts useful.
 % 
 % 
 % Very Truly Yours,

Check the heads of the capacitors beside the CPU for "crud". Sometimes a
fresh proc will work for a while in a board that has gimped capacitors,
although it will die eventually.
Good luck

Adjust your cron for hourly snapshots.

What if the NetApp server is compromised or otherwise damaged? Is the
NetApp using an opt-in or opt-out backup scheme? If the hardware breaks,
can you mount the filesystem with standard Unix tools and recover?

Tape.

Or...

Increase your backup window by adding entries to the script.

Derek,

  Thanks. I presume they come formatted for Microsoft so I'll just leave it

If one were to use this method for CVS, does this mean remote users could 
submit changes to their own remote repository and that the local repository 
will merge any changes made to either when sync'd?


Main CVS	rsync script	Remote CVS
Repository	<---------->	Repository
    ^				   ^
    |				   |
    v				   v
Local				Remote
Users				Users



I kinda doubt it, and admitidly this is a bad way to use CVS.  But I was 
once asked if the above were possible.  I looked into CVSup 
http://www.cvsup.org/ but the author said no dice.

(Nonetheless, CVSup is quite capable and will handle non-RCS files as well. 
  It uses rsync and may be worth checking out.)

Just idle curiosity.

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

Yuck, didn't really expect the formatting to come out. But you get the idea.

Mount with vfat.

Sometimes I have to mount with fat=12.  That seemed to be in RH7.3 but
not RH9.  I am not sure if that was a kernel issue, or hotplug.

Why bother with a "remote repository"?  CVS is a network aware program.

Just set CVSROOT="user at remothost:/pat/to/repository" and CVS_RSH=ssh

That's a totally reasonable thing.

I'm using openoffice and maple 9.  I need to curve fit some data points

distances out of a launcher of a ball at a particular compression
level.  So I'm plotting distance verses force at a specific

Subject: [PLUG] Perl Module to write OpenOffice Spreadsheets?
Message-ID: <1082-09021@sneakemail.com>

Folks:

I've hit Google and CPAN pretty hard but have not been able to find a perl
module that would allow a perl script to write out full-featured
spreadsheet files.  Given that the SXC format is so portable and
well-documented, I'm surprised I haven't seen one.

So far I've found:

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=perl+write+sxc&btnG=Google+Search
http://search.cpan.org/search?query=sxc&mode=all

Google led me to an OpenOffice script using an internal logfile-to-XML
module, but I have been unable to find the actual module source so far,
and it appears to only offer limited capabilities.

The SXC parser on CPAN is read-only.

I'd really like to find something like Spreadsheet::WriteExcel without
having to resort to building it myself.  (Which wouldn't be too terribly
hard-- one of the reasons I suspect it's already been done.)

Any ideas?

Thanks,

> [backups via rsync]

Rsync is fine if you have a lot of files that are in one of the two categories 
below:

1) they are small,

2) they are not renamed.

If you have any kind of database or "old-style" log rotation, you fail both 
these conditions as Keith noted a few days ago.

In a previous life, I dealt with multi GB databases and found that rsync was 
more of a hinderance than not.

First, only some databases come with support for taking snapshots.  Postgres 
is particularly annoying in this regard.  MySQL isn't much better, but a 
combination of "LOCK ALL TABLES" and "FLUSH TABLES" will get you a version of 
the DB on disk that is clean.  You can then use LVM with its filesystem 
snapshot capability to make a copy.  It took a couple of seconds at most to 
do this. Definitely odd, but we had a lot of luck with it.  Of course, we 
also used MySQL replication to keep live copies on different systems.  I 
think Postgres has this now too.

In doing this, we found that rsync was too slow deciding that a file had 
changed (some were many GB in size).  So, we just checked change dates and 
did brute force copies.  We lowered our sync time dramatically doing this.

In going through our backup strategies, we found that the following process 
gave us good results:

- first eliminate files that are installed from the OS install.  I.e. things 
that came on the installation CD-ROM or updates afterward.  These are easier 
to reinstall directly from original media or other copies.  Things that rsync 
does not need to check are faster than things it does!

- copy /etc all the time.  It tarred and gzipped faster than we could run 
rsync on it remotely, so we just had a local script that would periodically 
tar and gzip /etc to save our configs.  Then rsync would look in the 
directory where the gzip file was and decide whether or not to copy it.

- look carefully at other data files.  Segregate those into several 
categories:
	- big and change often
	- big and never change/change very infrequently
	- small and change often
	- small and never change/change infrequently
	- files that get renamed at some point (logs etc.).

We handled the big files manually.  This turned out to be easy because there 
were not that many of them and some simple shell scripts doing various things 
and LVM snapshots were enough to get us solid, coherent copies when needed.

The smaller files could be handled by rsync if there wasn't a reason to 
include them in with some of the bigger files.  I.e. we handled all database 
files the same way regardless of size.

We bent over backward to avoid renaming files.  This worked fairly well, but 
we still had a few that were renamed.  Luckily only one was big (the MySQL 
full log).  That file we managed to rename once to mysql_full_log_<data and 
time>.log and thus rsync was not too much of a problem.  We timed the 
rotation of the log file to be just before rsync would kick off.  That way, 
the mysql_fulllog.log file was always fairly small and none of the rotated 
files had changed (except for the new one).  This helped a lot.  We cut 
several minutes off of rsync times this way.

Rsync is a nice tool, but it is not a "one size fits all" tool.  In fact, I've 
often found that it simply doesn't do the things I need it to do for most of 
my server data.  For home directories for users it might be OK.  YMMV.  Each 
system is different and has different requirements.

Best,
Kyle

Of course that's the way it works, but in this case the repository was ~500M 
and was being grabbed from Ireland (IIRC).  It took many hours and they 
didn't want to do that very often.

uh, no.  CVS needs special handling to do merges correctly, and
there will always be cases that need manual intervention.

DCVS might become workable, but if you need repository
replication it might be better to just start with some other
system entirely, like bitkeeper or arch.

GNUplot will probably do it for you, but it's not the simplest program
to figure out.  OpenOffice, however, should have everything you need to
fit a curve and make a graph.  If it doesn't I know Gnumeric 1.2 will.

Regression curves are available on the x-y type of chart. 
Select the series, then go to object properties - statistics - regression curves to choose the type of curve to fit

efficient renames could probably be added to rsync.  just a
matter of picking a reasonable efficiency tradeoff.  (this is
something I've been thinking about because it's annoying when
renaming a directory causes rsync to retransmit every file under
that directory.)

for big database-sized files... there are a couple tunable
parameters that might help.  in an ideal world, rsync would
automatically adapt its strategy to the relative speeds of your
network and disk and cpu.

http://slashdot.org/interviews/99/10/29/0832246.shtml

This is an interview with Bruce Schneier, arguably among the top experts
in computer security.  In the answer to the first question he discusses
the need for deep public review of security.

Also, in his book "Secrets and Lies", in several places he discusses
explicitly how Open Source software is more secure because of the peer
review by security experts that can happen.  He also is careful to caution
that just because it's Open Source doesn't mean that the peer review *has*
happened, and such products will be less secure as a result.

I don't have the book handy so I can't quote sections.

This link from IBM also discusses this topic and provides a lot of the
same advice:

I think: 

  1) boot from Knoppix (or some other recovery disk with rsync),

  2) mount your fixed/replaced local media, 
 
  3) rsync from your backup server,
 
  4) grub-install, 

  5) reboot.

It's young and incomplete, but I'd much rather add my patches to an

In short, yes.  That should fit my needs-- thanks for the human-Google!

My Googling error was to try to include either Scalc, XML, SXC, or other

But why throw _anything_ away until you are out of media?  Free space
is wasted space, I always say.  My locally hacked solution to do
basically the same thing just kept all snapshots, but the script would
ensure enough space by deleting the oldest snapshots until the space
needed was available.  Instead of rotating hourly.N naming, I just had
a /snapshots/<tree>/YYYYMMDD-HHMM/ naming (year, month, day, hour,
minute, respectively) and could easily figure out which was oldest by
sorting appropriately.

What the rsync solution was missing the last time I looked was a
--dry-run (or similar) option that would report how much disk space
you needed to make your snapshot, so that you had a target number you
could use to free adequate space.

Below is a link to my one bash script solution (with configuration file)
built on ssh, dump/restore, using an ssh authorized_keys for the remote
user. I only do nightly incrementals and weekend fulls. If you ask John
Sechrest you'll find out I've been writing dump scripting for a long time
now... :)

This script has saved my bacon three times now with disk crashes. The
restore is easy via ssh and restore (see the script itself for example
invocation, since it does a dump over ssh, then runs restore as a
cross-check to dump the table of contents). You can get ssh and restore
off a live linux CD (knoppix), one-floppy linuxes or the like. If you
don't have any network access, in general, any dump-based solution can be
restored (in a pinch) by moving the disk drive to the machine with the
backup, and rebuilding it there, then moving it back to the busted
machine.

The script itself is at:
http://twiki.loowit.net/bin/view/Main/BackupScripts

Why use Korn shell when you can do all that with bash and it already comes
standard? In general, bash is a superset of Korn shell functionality,
including command-line editing (vi or emacs), command-completion, and all
of the function, alias, looping, parameter, and command substitution that
Korn shell can do ${FNAME##*?}. bash also adds of some of the csh
interactives (all the ! and ^^^ syntax, history, pushd, popd, dirs).

You may want to include or exclude filesystems using field 5 of the
/etc/fstab... it's the standard way since BSD.

Cheers,
James

Maybe I blacked out temporarily, but when I tried --dry-run with the

If the problem is the time it takes to transfer the initial checkout
for a big repository, one common solution is to create snapshots of a
checked out working directory and distribute those.  The snapshots can
be distributed as tar archives or with rsync.  To setup a working
directory, a developer copies the snapshot, changes the CVS/Root files
to put in their login, and does an update to get any recent changes.

I haven't used Maple in years, and even then, I don't remember doing any
graphing stuff with it, although I'm sure it is capable of it.

Anyway - when I needed to graph things for a lab report, I *THINK* I used
guppy (or something like that) with Gnumeric.  If you're using Slackware,
make sure it's verion 9.0 or 9.1 or I don't think Guppy is installed (IIRC
I emailed Pat about it during the 9.0 beta cycle).

You could then export the Guppy/Gnumeric-generated graphs to something you
can import into OO.

I really don't know about any CLI utilities to do the same, sorry.

Ack.... gotta run!  LAte for class, gotta print a paper....

adios..

  Paul Heinlein wrote an e-mail on this, but for some reason it's not in my
saved messages file.

  What I do with new applications available only as tarballs is replace the
'make install' step with 'checkinstall'. While the current, stable version
of checkinstall goes ahead and installs the package, too, I'm told the beta
version will allow you to build the package but not install it.

We did that too.  I think the issue was that the remote users were basically 
forking the project and it included a large toolchain.  Think we ended up 
leaving them to their own devices instead of managing their source.

That's really not true. What you do is write a dummy package that
contains no files, just a bunch of Provides: lines. That's what I did
on my Solaris box to let rpm know what libraries came installed with
the system.

First, you create the .spec file. It'd look something like this:

#
# this is a virtual rpm; it doesn't contain any files, just a list
# of Provides taken from the base solaris os. See the very bottom
# of this .spec for the actual package info...
#

Summary: Manually installed libraries
Name: handbuilt
Version: 1.0
Release: 1
Copyright: GPL
Group: System Environment/Base
Packager: Rich Shepard <>
# these are just examples. season to taste
Provides: lib450.so.1
Provides: libC.so.3
Provides: libC.so.5
Provides: libCrun.so.1
Provides: libCstd.so.1
Provides: libFS.so
Provides: libFS.so.5
Provides: libICE.so
Provides: libICE.so.6

%description
This is a virtual RPM package.  It contains no actual files.  It uses
the `Provides' token from RPM 3.x and later to list many of the shared
libraries I've installed by hand on my system.

%prep
# nothing to do

%build
# nothing to do

%install
# nothing to do

%clean
# nothing to do

%files
# nothing here

#
# eof
#


Then "build" the rpm: "rpm -bb /path/to/foo.spec" -- and install it. 
From that point forward, rpm is aware of the libraries you've listed 
in the various Provides: lines. Note that you don't need to provide a 
full path to the library, just its basename."

  You're certainly welcome. What I like about checkinstall is the ability to
make packages for Red Hat, Debian or Slackware. Kewel!

Can openoffice put a 1" by 1" box grid on a section of a page for me
to graph on by hand?  

If created tables that have the ranges from releasing a ball from the
spring launcher we used at specified angles and compression.  Is there
a way for me to take the tables and generate scatter plots that relate
distance and angle?

Is there an easy way to take a six cell table and make it five cell
after the fact instead of merging the last two cells creating one
unsightly long cell? 

I ran into some kind of scatter but how to you map the correct table
to it?  For that matter, how do I map the correct part of a table
since portions of it are text fields?

I've got an Intel InBusiness Print Station I got at Free Geek a long
time ago. It's installed on a mixed-OS network here in my home office. 

I cannot get it working under RH or Libranet.

It works under XP and 98 fine. 

Here's my script.cfg from /var/spool/lpd/IBM_4019

share='\\PS717DD1\Printer1'
hostip='192.168.10.48'
user=''
password=""
workgroup='Workgroup'
translate='no'

I've got an external JetDirect box on the same network that works well.

I've had trouble looking to see if it's on a hardware compatibility
list, maybe because it's a network device.

Any ideas?

About a week back, I posted a request for help evaluating the Suse
mods to Redhat logrotate.  logrotate with the "dateext" enhancements
eliminates a lot of renaming.  When you think about it, if you are
backing up logfiles at all, you want to be able to find them by
date anyway, not by some meaningless numeric suffix. 

Another way to eliminate excess storage is to use Maildir rather than
Mbox format for mail.  This eliminates much of the "incrementing big
file" problem.  

One remaining P.I.T.A. is the .db files made by my current bogofilter  
setup.  When I save a mail file, or chuck it into the spam bin, I 
run it through bogofilter training.  Both the bogofilter .db files
get updated.  As they are running towards 90MB now, this means another
full copy gets saved at every backup.  Unless I come up with a better
way to do it, I will probably just turn off the training for a while.

Microsoft is going to (or did?) remove support for non-MSNv9 protocol
clients to connect.  The new protocol uses SSL, for one thing.

GAIM has had support for the new protocol since version 0.69 or 0.68, (I
forget which) which was rushed out the door when Yahoo's protocol change
locked everybody out of Yahoo.

Non-MSN clients are still able to connect if they figured out the new
protocol, I'm logged in under two MSN IDs right now (geesh, I wish I
could talk everybody in to jabber!)...

I belive it's a sparse file.  Check "du" on it, instead of looking

Yeah, my experiences were with some older RH servers.  I run SuSE on my 
desktop, but never noticed this log rotation difference in SuSE until you 
mentioned it :-(  Had we seen this, we might have moved to SuSE as it was 
fairly annoying on several levels.

I wasn't dealing with user machines.  This is also a good way to test ReiserFS 
as it deals very well with a huge number of files in a directory (I've tried 
about 500k) :-)

Database files of any kind are nasty.  They are large, they have changes that 
occur throughout them (especially in updatable tables) and generally do 
things that make rsync copy them every single time.  For us, the overhead of 
rsync determining that the file had changed on a 10GB file was too high.  

Best,
Kyle

Y'all are working too hard at this. Go look at
http://rdiff-backup.stanford.edu

rdiff-backup provides a mirror of a backed up directory while also
allowing an arbitrary number of incrementals. It uses rdiff from
librsync (think rsync algorithm) to intelligently reverse diff
binaries which helps deal w/ incrementing big files, DBs, etc.

It's behavior regarding renamed files is the same as rsync, e.g. the
file is copied again. Bummer.

I've noticed that the recent test kernels (and maybe back into 2.5.xx)
have exhibited twitchy mouse movement in X11.  Twitchy is probably the

the mouse.  I've never needed to do it before.

I think you'll see the same thing if you use a preemptable 2.4.x kernel.

I've noticed a similar problem... it took me a few weeks to get used to
it, but now I'm pretty much accustomed to the increased sensitivity. 
The only problem I have is grabbing the two-pixel-wide handles on my
fluxbox theme's corners.  I have to give it a few shots.  :-)

I haven't seen how to slow it down... it's too fast both for my USB
mouse and my PS/2 (touchpad) mouse.  Any information I've seen has been
related to telling X not to accelerate it, but turning the acceleration
down to nothing didn't change the behavior at all as far as I noticed.

Try a "slow rename":

  ln old-name new-name
  rsync -a -H [...] src dest
  rm old-name
  rsync -a -H [...] src dest

Presto-chango?  Or not?

A bit of creative (or perhaps not so) cutting and pasting will make a great
couple of quotes. Who better to make your argument for you than your
opposition? 

http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/government/opensource.mspx

" . . . By providing source code for inspection, sophisticated consumers
(mostly large organizations and governments) can examine the code to verify
that it performs as advertised and contains no hidden features."

" . . . One advantage of open source is the fact that anyone can potentially
examine source code, identify security flaws and propose security fixes."

Quote CERT statistics from years that fit your objective, although this
might be a bit more difficult to compile unless you are targeting a certain
project. 

Of course, all work and no rolling on the floor laughing makes projects less
entertaining, so this choice bit should leave you in stitches if you've ever
applied a MS patch on a windows box. A warning, finish whatever you have in
your mouth before proceeding.

" . . . Some open source software relies on volunteers to create and
distribute patches for security vulnerabilities. These patches may or may
not be rigorously tested before release and therefore might create further
vulnerabilities or software incompatibilities."

That will work, not as much fun, but it'll work.

Something to seriously consider is an encrypted file system on part of
the device, windbowz wouldn't be able to see it, but at least you'd have
a place to store sensitive information (these things are easy to
misplace) and make it transportable to all your linux boxes.

Food for thought, anyway.

Sure, but my users have this habit of not informing me when they rename a 
file, and it seems non-trival to find renamed (and possibly/probably 
changed) files after the fact. How am I going to know from what to link?

We've just been throwing disk space at it and not sweating it. Those w/ 
giant rotated logs are understandably annoyed, but maybe this is 
predictable enough to deal with, either via linking or a date-based 
logrotate.

Oh, yes. I remember something about this "super new and perfect" encryption
that was released a couple years ago (90s?) that was closed source was
broken within several days of release. Details, of course, escape me. Of
course, they kept on selling the product, and people continued to buy it.
/shrug. Read on as to why I think this is remotely relevant. 

Ditto with "copy protection" of CDs. I don't think there is a protected CD
out there that hasn't had a crack made for it. The dismal failure of dongles
and safedisk, etc should be pretty good evidence of this. I don't believe
safedisk and friends are open source. I'm sure someone would of have shown
them that their "protection" is about as effective as a condom that has been
sitting in a wallet for 6 months. 
I'm not sure if you can get statistics on the piracy rate of x product
protected by x protection, but I'm sure the BSA would love to spout their
overly inflated BS numbers about some products to you. This makes great
source material, virtually every bonehead manager / congress critter will
accept their numbers without question. 

Essentially, my main point is that if you have to conceal your algorithm to
keep the "encryption" (read obfuscation) secure, your algorithm isn't worth
anything. IIRC, every single encryption scheme based on a "s3cr3t algorithm"
has been broken, from the enigma to the latest retarded encryption /
protection scheme being laughed at on /. 

Granted, this does not translate directly into open source vs. closed
source, but the lessons learned do relate. 
Anyways, good luck.

In OO calc, "Insert" "Chart" should get the ball rolling.

You know, I'd use jabber if it weren't for the domain name aspect.  (I'd have my friends and family using it, too.)  I don't want to depend on a particular jabber server, but I don't want to have to run my own in order to have a permanent address/identifier as with ICQ.  I understand jabber is decentralized, but I really want a non-proprietary protocol that offers a global, movable identifier.

Is that even possible?

Just be careful of static discharge (always an issue, but seems to be more
of an issue when it is hanging around your neck between your wool sweater
and t-shirt. I know a couple of people who have had issues with the soyo
ones (and static), but I have one that has been working fine for the last
year. A really waterproof one would be quite cool (usb007.com has one, but I
still don't exactly trust companies whose only claim to existence is a
webpage). USB 2.0 support is such an improvement over the older units,
although if you get paid by the hour, it might be worth it to use the 1.1
drives.

That will work, not as much fun, but it'll work.

Something to seriously consider is an encrypted file system on part of
the device, windbowz wouldn't be able to see it, but at least you'd have
a place to store sensitive information (these things are easy to
misplace) and make it transportable to all your linux boxes.

Food for thought, anyway.

Subject: [PLUG] Mail configuration
Message-ID: <1066800671.2712.29.camel@atlas.gotdns.org>

This is my latest idea to organize myself.  Right now I am trying to
check 2 pop3 accounts and 3 imap accounts daily.  What I would like to
do is setup my linux box at home to collect all my mail and serve it up
in imap.  I think I would like to use maildir instead of mbox as I have
had some trouble with my mbox files and I think it would be neat to try
something new (to me).  

So far, I have fetchmail polling one pop3 account and serving it in
dovecot which I access with squirrelmail.  I would like my mail to be in
separate folders (filtered) for a few mailing lists and by the accounts.

I am using fedora and am trying to figure out the best way to do this. 
If I use fetchmail to get the mail do I filter it with procmail?  I
would like to be able to access my email with a client such as evolution
or thunderbird when I am at home.  Are there any webmail clients that
support sending from multiple addresses?  ie can I reply to a mail that
came on one of my imap accounts and have it go through that one again? 
Will all replies have to come from my local box?

thanks for the ideas

I think there's a way to slow it down, but I can't remember where I saw it.  Don't see it in xset.  However, I have noticed another problem with 2.6, where after X starts, my USB mouse is really jerky for several seconds, and then it becomes smooth and, as you describe, really sensitive.  Maybe they just need to tweak it a little, still, to get it to work as in 2.4.

Gaim 0.71 works for me, but so did 0.63 for me.. but from what I 
understand it shouldn't have, perhaps they had a "grace period" where 
they allowed old protocols to connect.

I've used both .70 and .71 with msn since the 15th. Today in fact.

What about just using the Jabber.org or Jabber.com servers?

There are a lot of servers out there that will last for a while,
although I don't know if they can be considered as reliable as the above
two.

I think that's about as close as you can get today.

That's one right idea.  You could also just set the other accounts to
forward immediately to your mail server.  But procmail is the way to go
for sorting... unless you use real separate mail accounts for each
incoming message source.

I haven't touched SquirrelMail in a long time, but back when I was
involved, the dev list was discussing roles pretty seriously.  Could be
there.

Mail doesn't come out of a box.  It's just a matter of telling your SMTP
server to let you set the From: header to whatever you like.

Unpack:

for tar.gz or .tgz

tar xzf file.tar.gz

for tar.bz2 or .tb2

tar xjf file.tar.bz2

Install:
Read the instructions in the file README or INSTALL
that are within the file.

Peace,

If they kept the RedHat init sequence, DMA gets enabled later (on RH it's
done when it parses /etc/sysconfig/harddisks, from rc.sysinit.

This last part looks like it is running UDMA, instead of DMA.  This is a
good thing, UDMA is a faster protocol.

Try turning off DMA using hdparm, then rerun the -Tt tests.  They will
be slower if DMA was functioning before.

100 MB/sec. is about right for UDMA(100), the 30 MB/sec is about right
for a modern IDE drive.

WOW, better than 40 MB/sec.  What kind of drive is that one?

Yes, and it works great.

In ~/.fetchmailrc, you'd have poll statements for each server, imap or
pop3:

  poll first.mailserver.com proto pop3
    user ...
  poll second.mailserver.com proto imap
    user ...

Better yet, use SSL:

  # enter a subshell where all output is stored in a file called
  # /tmp/first.mailserver.com
  script /tmp/first.mailserver.com
  # connect to the remote pop3 server over ssl
  openssl s_client -connect first.mailserver.com:995
  # logout of mail server without doing anything
  quit
  # exit the subshell; you'll be back in your original shell
  # environment
  exit
  # grab the remote cert from the subshell session and store it in
  # your home directory
  sed '/BEGIN CERTIFICATE/,/END CERTIFICATE/!d' \
    /tmp/first.mailserver.com \
    > ~/certs/first.mailserver.com.pem

Then, in .fetchmailrc, you could do

  poll first.mailserver.com proto pop3
    user ...,
    ssl,
    sslcert "/home/you/certs/first.mailserver.com.pem"

:-)

By default, fetchmail will try to deliver mail locally using sendmail,
which means you'll end up getting procmail as the delivery program. So
in ~/.procmailrc you can filter by mailing list name or by header
address or whatever, e.g.,

  :0 :
  * ^TO_you at different\.server\.com
  adifferentme

  :0 :
  * ^List-Id:.*<plug.lists.pdxlinux.org>
  plug

  :0 :
  * ^Sender: owner-sparc@
  sparc-openbsd

  :0 :
  * ^List-Id:.*<fedora-devel-list\.redhat\.com>
  fedora-devel-list

I've never seen such a beast, but if you find one please let the list
know, ok?

won't be helpful for renaming/moving directories, like
    mv ~/cumshots ~/art/cumshots

1. detecting files that were renamed but didn't otherwise change:
     on src
       generate a list of (srcfile, mtime, size)
       send it to dest
     on dest
       generate a list of (destfile, mtime, size)
       find all destfiles and srcfiles with identical (mtime, size)
         checksum each destfile
         ask src for checksum of each srcfile
         if checksums match,
            assume it's the same file
            do a rename
     this is a probabilistic algorithm,
     it might get false positive matches (very rarely),
     but it's no worse than rsync's usual duplicate check,
     which also might get false positives (very rarely).

2. detecting files that were both renamed and changed:
     first take care of files that were renamed but didn't change
     then take care of files that weren't renamed but did change
     you're left with a list of src files with no known dest
       and dest files with no known src
     pretend that the remaining src files and dest files are
       a single huge file
       and run the rsync rolling-checksum algorithm on that
     (simplistic version:
       pack the src files and dest files into a .tar
       sync src.tar to dest.tar
       unpack dest.tar
       remove dest files that are no longer in dest.tar)

3. improving the rsync algorithm for large files (eg, database
   files, or the huge pseudo-file in part 2 above):
     so rsync slices a destination file into blocks and sends
     checksums of each block to the src, on the theory that the
     src can use the checksums to avoid sending unchanged data
     (no matter where it is in the src file).

     and one reason rsync sucks for large files is the blocksize
     defaults to 700 bytes, which was based on experiments in
     transmitting the linux kernel source, which is 1) a
     collection of pretty small files, 2) pretty small overall.

     there's an option to change the blocksize, but it affects
     the entire rsync.  if you want to tune it by hand, you'll
     probably want to rsync the big files separately from
     everything else.

     rsync could be taught to adjust this blocksize dynamically,
     perhaps set it to something like 1% of the file size.  this
     will need some experimenting.

     another thing to explore is the potential uses of recursive
     subdivision: like split a file into 100 pieces, then split
     mismatched blocks into smaller pieces, until some
     threshhold.  this probably becomes a number of time/space
     tradeoffs, like, if you have the memory you don't need to
     keep recomputing checksums, in a single read pass you can
     generate all the checksums you might need and save them.

this is off the top of my head.  I'll have to sit down sometime
and do some performance analysis of large file rsyncs, make sure
I understand what the bottlenecks are, before I plunge into doing
any coding.  if I ever do get around to looking at this.

and then there are plenty of potential auto-tuning to explore,
like the disk speed vs network speed question.

Gaim is supposed to work with MSN as long as you have SSL installed
which should come with Mozilla.  Has anyone had to do the work around
posted at gaim.sourceforge.net that can help me get mine to work again.
I tried the work around and it didn't work.

Most of my friends are on MSN and I'd like to start chatting with them
again..

Thanks.

I use SquirrelMail and it gives me a web base interface via IMAP to my server.  I
have multiple email accounts and can alter the from address in the UI to allow me to
send from different email accounts.  Works great.  Only interface I know use for all
my email.

It also allows me to POP off my other server and store email locally.  So, one
interface.

Well, in general terms, my ICQ number will last, theoretically, as long as ICQ itself lasts.  That may or may not be true of jabber.org/com.  But more than that, it's to the idea of having anyone else's domain in my ID that I object.  I think email is flawed in that regard, too.  ('Course, I'm such a purist, I think all the TLD names should go away as well, so we can just have http://google/.)

I really think a personal identifier should be personal and permanent, as in my perfect world.  If you can show me why that just won't work (without centralized, commercial support), then I'll consider going to jabber.

OK, with this talk about using different mail accounts for various
things, I have a question.

How are people making the seperate email addresses?

I'm editing /etc/postfix/aliases (and running newaliases). 

Is there a different way?

Interesting, but I don't see how this enables a globally unique identifier, as with ICQ.  It's completely decentralized, no?

(Of course, the idea is to be able to meet someone in a bar and say, "Look for me on [Jason's-perfect-world-IM-protocol].  My nick is zaphod42."  And that would do it.  No connecting to a specific network a la IRC; and if I had given my nick to someone eight years prior, they could still find me, etc., etc. . . .)

A jabber.org or jabber.com account will last, as long as jabber.org/com
last.  We're just talking about frailty there, you feel ICQ is more
likely to last a few more years than jabber.org or jabber.com.

> I really think a personal identifier should be personal and permanent, as in my perfect world.  If you can show me why that just won't work (without centralized, commercial support), then I'll consider going to jabber.

I just don't see how it could work without some centralized support, and
I don't see how the centralized support would work well without
commercial interests.  When you're talking about running an IM server,
resources need to be devoted to it... if it were to get up and going
without commercial support of any kind, I don't know that we could trust
it to last, could we?

I really feel Jabber is as close as we're going to get.  It is really
pretty easy to run your own Jabber server.  PLUG had one until it was
recently turned off.  I have one running on my little server
authenticating locally (that is, it uses the unix accounts) that wasn't
to difficult to set up.  As far as being a personal identifier, it still
has all the flaws of email, I suppose.

Hardly anybody ever uses Jabber, though.  I can't seem to talk anybody
in to it... lol... when I switched domains and whiped out my contact
list, three months ago, I've only added one person back, and they're on
my jabber server, too.  :-)

As Dan pointed out, the "slow rename" scheme I suggested only works
when you have the cooperation of the renamer.  On a desktop, that
might often be the case.  For an adminstrator of "users", it isn't
going to be practical.

For your particular example, if you have a cooperative user, you can
use:
      cp -al ~/cumshots ~/art/cumshots
      rsync -a -H [...] src dest
      rm -rf ~/cumshots
      rsync -a -H [...] src dest

I don't think you could do such a thing without centralized authority.
Otherwise, how do you handle name conflicts?

It could be managed individually in a similar way to DNS, I suppose.

Imagine that you register a name and the rootservers tell the client your
public key and then you authenticate with the server via your private key.

However, at that point you may as well just use an email address that has
a public key registered with one of the standard keyservers.

Both may fail.  But being decentralized and open, jabber would likely persist on other servers.  Which gives jabber the advantage, naturally, but I'd still have to change my ID, notify all my friends, etc., and that's what I'd like to avoid.  Thanks to gaim, changing clients isn't an issue.

Well, this is just where I am in my consideration; but then, it's harder to prove something impossible than to prove it possible.  (Considering examples such as gnutella, it seems the only problem is how to register those unique nicknames.)  As it stands, most of my IM buddies are on ICQ, and I'm hesitant to try to convert them to jabber, unless, as you say:

> I really feel Jabber is as close as we're going to get.  It is really

But that's not the whole problem.  I already host several domains, so I could easily run jabber.  But then there're all my friends, who may or may not want to use my server for IM (or have my domain in their handles).  Having to make that sort of decision, for most lusers, is per se a deterrent to using jabber.  And most end users don't want to maintain multiple IM accounts.  They just want something simple and stable (read popular).  One reason why MSN is popular is that users trust M$ to keep it around.

That's what I do.  Beware that due to spam, many lists now require you to
post using the same address you're subscribed as.  One workaround is to
subscribe again using your sending address and tell the listproc not to
send mail.

> Is there a different way?

I believe you can have mail to undefined addresses go to a particular
account, and that way you can just start using the address without setting
it up first.  But that would be a Very Bad Idea in these days of
dictionary-spam attacks.

Dave Farber recently got one of those, incidentally.  He notes that "There
were 12,000-15,000 messages per hour coming in for the 12 hour period [of
the attack]" and "...there were over 61,000 distinct IP addresses dumping
messages at the server."  Full account here:

Just now. Null effect

Any other possibilities come to mind? It's got two parallel ports.

I, personally, use Procmail to filter lists into their own mbox's. 
IMHO, it's superior to having a seperate address for each mailing list.

IIRC, the option is luser_relay in main.cf (I assume we're talking about
Postfix).

I think that sounds scarey, myself.  :-)

It most likely is a tar file compressed with bzip.  Often tbz eq tar.bz2.

Message-ID: <45123.68.107.223.201.1066853536.squirrel@webmail.pdxlug.org>

This should be an easy one for you Perl gurus...  ;-)

I have a 3 dimensional array in Perl...

$myarray[$val1][$val2][$val3]

I would like to print every value in the array.  I could construct 3
for-loops to loop through each of the 3 dimensions, but I don't know the
max index of each dimension.  Is there a way to find the max index for
each dimension?  Or is there an easy way to loop through all values in a
multi-dimensional array?

Thanks,
~M

That's good thinking, pretty much what I've been chewing on.

Now, the domain names in email addresses wouldn't be such a lame idea if end users were compelled to purchase their own domains.  The trick is making it mega-simple and not requiring any other services.  Probably the ISP would offer to set it up (some probably do this now), billing an extra $20/year or so.  They could then point these "personal domains" toward their own email servers, etc., and when users change locations, their new ISPs would transfer the domain.

At this point, it should be possible to use regular email addresses in a decentralized jabber-like system, using DNS to locate the server or servers to which each IM user connects--or perhaps, to which a particular domain connects.  Which would mean users on any particular domain would all have to use the same IM server(s), as with email; but still, one address for both email and IM sounds pretty good, from a user perspective.

But I'm just thinking out loud.  Feel free to take pot shots at this, or to simplify it to the point of absurdity.

Cheap, but works depending on the end product.

use Data::Dumper;

print Dumper(\@myarray);

Even more interesting is that I ran a test with 3 elements and it brought
my computer to a screaching halt with the following message:

Use of reference "ARRAY(0x804c970)" as array index at testing.pl line 10.

Line 10 is the print statement...

Since this works under Windows, I assume you can ping (and maybe telnet to) 
192.168.10.48

Anything interesting in /var/spool/lpd/error-log?

Are the ownership & permissions on /var/spool/lpd/ib4019 correct?
(Should be 775) drwxrwxr-x...I take that back, looks like lp/lp drwx------ 
should work.

I believe you said this was Red Hat, make sure you have the latest LPRng 
package for your release.

And this will print the data without the Perl syntax:

foreach my $x ( @myarray ) {
  foreach my $y ( @{$x} ) {
    print join(" " @{$y}), "\n";
  }
}

which is just a sloppy way of doing what Paul did:

foreach my $x ( @myarray ) {
  foreach my $y ( @{$x} ) {
    foreach my $z ( @{$y} ) {
      print "$z\n";
    }
  }
}

Well, it was off the cuff. :-) How about this?

foreach my $x ( @myarray ) {
  foreach my $y ( @{$myarray[$x]} ) {
    foreach my $z ( @{$myarrray[$x][$y]} ) {

For my little print server, I have just lp:\ for the network port.

It's fun to run your code and watch my gig of RAM and all my swap slowly
vanish in xosview.  ;-)  I get the same results, or lack of results, I
should say, but without the array error as before.  Eventually the script
dies on with an "Out of memory!" error.  Here's my test script:

#!/usr/bin/perl

$myarray[1][4][1] = "blah blah blah";
$myarray[7][1][2] = "yadda yadda yadda";
$myarray[9][8][1] = "humdeedumdeedum";

foreach my $x ( @myarray ) {
   foreach my $y ( @{$myarray[$x]} ) {
      foreach my $z ( @{$myarrray[$x][$y]} ) {
         print $myarray[$x][$y][$z], "\n";
      }
   }
}

It's got two 25 pin connectors on the back labeled Printer 1 and Printer
2.

If it only had one, I think I'd be home free...

All up to date, too

I've reset it's brains to factory default and used the Win based
software to set it's IP and other stuff.

I shared the printer on the windows box, and samba shared it, just to
say I could do it. Works fine, but not what I wanted. I turn that PC
off.

I'm thinking of using the RH box as the print server for it since it's
always up and running, then I could sell the Intel server to a
windows-only shop.

I just want to toss my vote in (again) to switch over to non-munged
Reply-To.

For those of you using Evolution, there's a way to bind ctrl+l to Reply
To List, as was posted earlier in the list (if you can't find it, I'll
find it for you)...

That article lists out Elm, Pine, and Mail as supporting Reply To List
or something similar.

AOL supports 'Reply To All' which should work similarly when dealing
with list traffic.

OE at least has Reply To All, I don't know about Reply to List.

Gnus and Mozilla I can't really test as I don't have either Emacs or
Mozilla set up t handle any kind of email.

I just fired up KMail - it supports Reply To List.

Does anybody here use a broken mail client that doesn't support Reply To
List?

I think we should change.

Cool.  I hear it's '486-based.  Just install Linux on it. ;)

Since I've used the old Intel NetPort thingies to good effect, I got
curious about your problem, and asked Google.  What a flashback from my
ol' Novell/Microsoft tech days.  After working with JetDirects for several
years, I'd forgotten how wonky these things could be:
http://www.intel.com/support/inbusiness/printstation/30090.htm
Amusingly, NetWare IPX users were expected to install TCP/IP or NetBEUI to
use it, and DOS or Windows 3.x users were SOL.

But on TCP/IP it uses a seekrit protocol known as "FTP":
http://www.linuxprinting.org/pipermail/general-list/2003q2/003932.html
According to this, you pipe the print output to an FTP client that uploads
it to the filename LPT1: or LPT2:.

I supose it should be considered the Mailing List corollary to Godwin's
Law. At some point every discussion will eventually mention the infamous
Reply-To article. That article is <please insert your prefered expletive
here>. This is a *mailing list*, the whole bloody point of the list
server is to modify headers and pass the messages along.

The saner approach is to consider whether you want to keep discussions
alive, or encourage discussions to be short. In this case since it may
enlighten members to see solutions that are proposed I'd have to argue
that inserting a Reply-To header is the correct path (now whether it
should remove the header if it is already present is another matter).

That's garbage.  There's no correlation between reply-to munging and
longer or shorter discussions.

The default behavior of most discussion list users is to use the "reply to
all" feature of their mailer (and most don't bother to edit those headers
to remove the sender when the sender is already on the list).  There's a
single-keystroke/button approach to replying to the list OR the sender.

With reply-to munging in place, replying to just the sender is an ordeal
that is not easy to automate without repairing every single message as it
arrives.

Do you really want to extend threads by making it difficult to NOT post to
the list or do you want to make both actions equally easy?

Right, I did see that, thanks. And I've been struggling with
experimenting on two other drives I have on another box. 

The trouble with the article is that it mentiones many options to
select, and properly cautions the user. However, it doesn't mention how
you can check to see _if_ your drives can handle the improvements. And
screwing around until something breaks on a production machine (well, a
personal production machine) isn't something I want to try. 

Unfortunately I'm not entirely sure what to check at the bios or on the
drive to determine which modifications are safe and which are not.

This is a quick thought:
Do you use a a roll mouse (nonoptical) ?  If your mouse uses a ball try 
removing it clearing the rolling bars.

No, still broken.  You're confusing the indexes with the values.

for my $x (@myarray) {
  for my $y (@$x) {
    for my $z (@$y) {
      print "$z\n";

Different compression algorithms.  Bzip2 compresses better(?).

Yes, you're right.  The compressed file ends up being smaller.
The trade-off is that it takes more cpu and memory to do the
compression.

Too bad this isn't a per-subscriber setting in GNU MailMan, then we could
dispose of this recurring debate. Anyone up for hacking a new feature in 
to MailMan? I've never looked at the code so I don't know how hard or easy
this would be.

Subject: [PLUG] Microsoft Earnings Report
Message-ID: <1066938355.17051.144.camel@sparticus>

All,

Shares of Microsoft common stock are down today on the heels of their Q4
earnings report:

http://sec.thomsonfn.com/sec/SecProd?pid=MzgwYlhOdVAkWQEQUALSTOEQUALSTO&transform=result&type=results&doc_type=REGST&doc_dcn=03948319&cont_format=HTML&cont_qualifier=C&doc_product=E&viewer=N#r4

Here are a few highlights:

"As a result of challenges to our business model, sales of our products
may decline, we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our
products, and our revenues and operating margins may consequently
decline. Since our inception, our business model has been based upon
customers agreeing to pay a fee to license software developed and
distributed by us."

Also...

"In recent years, there has been a growing challenge to the commercial
software model, often referred to as the Open Source model. Under the
Open Source model, software is produced by loosely associated groups of
unpaid programmers, and the resulting software and the intellectual
property contained therein is licensed to end users at substantially no
cost. The most notable example of Open Source software is the Linux
operating system. While we believe that our products provide customers
with significant advantages in security and productivity, and generally
have a lower total cost of ownership than Open Source software, the
popularization of the Open Source model continues to pose a significant
challenge to our business model, including recent efforts by proponents
of the Open Source model to convince governments worldwide to mandate
the use of Open Source software in their purchase and deployment of
software products. To the extent the Open Source model gains increasing
market acceptance, sales of our products may decline, we may have to
reduce the prices we charge for our products, and revenues and operating
margins may consequently decline."

Just thought you'd like to know.


Best,

  Tsch! Tsch! Excuse me for not feeling sorry for them.

  I wonder if the folks at Red Hat, etc. would agree with this assessment.

  Wonder what they're smoking up there. Aren't reality-altering drugs illegal

Awwww! Let's take up a collection for them.

I can't find the link, there was a report earlier this month about M$ buying 
back employee stock options, because they are worth less than the option 
price. 

The "news" media keeps throwing that $40 billion in the bank figure. But if 
you're the kind of wonk who likes to read SEC filings and annual reports, 
then you'd know that for several years now the only profit centers have been 
windoze, office, and their investment portfolio. They've been pouring money 
into all kinds of money-sucking new projects, like Xbox, MSN, and lord knows 
what all. 

I doubt they're going to have to pass the hat anytime soon, but I think the 
expectation of continued 30-40% annual growth is pretty much shot to heck.

Yeah. I bet /home/matt/certs/ didn't exist before you ran the script.
I thought about that after I sent it off, but I didn't think about it
enough to send out an erratum report. :-)

I was thinking along the lines of "if I reply to a message in a
certain imap folder, then use a different from: address than the
default" -- but for as little as I use SquirrelMail, manually typing
an address isn't so onerous.

That caught my eye, too. It's definitely a gray-area sort of
statement.

The distinction between "paid to produce proprietary, saleable
software" and "paid to produce open-source software that in turn
supports proprietary, saleable services/solutions," is pretty thin.

Then again, some open-source contributors are really "unpaid
programmers" (many of whom would like to think that 'unpaid' is a
temporary adjective :-).

I seem to recall that back when I was working for Wieden + Kennedy, they
had something like $96B in the bank.  That's not the mark of a profitable
company, I don't think.

Windows and Office (and PRIMARILY Office, interestingly enough) have
always been the only "profit centers" at M$.

Before XBox and MSN, there was Sidewalk, which cost a FORTUNE.  Oh, and
Bob.

There are lots of ways in which the company is simply not well-run...
being grossly immoral (and possibly amoral) is only one of them.

Or they're blaming us for the perceived drop in profits that they've had
to admit since the SEC has been cracking down on fallacious filings.

Microsoft (and MANY other companies... probably MOST large corporations)
have been lying to the SEC or publishing highly misleading financial data
for the last fifteen or twenty years.  The regulators have been turning a
blind eye to that sort of thing because it made "the economy" look better,
but situations like those with Enron and WorldCom and so forth coming to
the surface, companies have been slightly reluctant to lie as about their
earnings.

This provides for no end of smart remarks by us OSS advocates. I'll try
to limit myself to two.

1. This news just in - Competitive pressure reduces prices.

2. "The fact that competition from the Open Source model may cause us to
reduce our prices in no way suggests that we are now or ever have been
a monopoly."

eh..., okay, a third:

3. I liked the spin about "unpaid programmers" working on OSS. Last study 
I saw on the matter (which of course I can't find) found that most OSS 
programmers are paid for what they do, but in the context of some other 
primary job function.

I have some questions about this, if anyone knows the answers....  How 
much can MS isolate themselves and their market by using proprietary 
file formats that they "own".  For example, OpenOffice supports most MS 
file formats (doc, xls, ...).  Is this legal?  Can a company patent a 
file format?  If so, does MS just look the other way in order to avoid 
complicated legal battles?

I think Adobe owns Acrobat reader and the product (forgot the name) that 
creates PDF files.  Is it legal for me to create a PDF using rtf2pdf and 
put it on my web site without using their product?  I know that people 
do it all the time, but is it technically legal?

If this is not technically legal (even though they have not gone after 
people thus far for doing it), then eventually corporations will exploit 
that law to protect their monopolies.

Then that leads me to ask, what if I developed an open source streaming 
audio client program that recognizes rm files?  Does anyone know the 
laws about this?  If open source developers are free to use file formats 
that were developed for proprietary products, then those products will 
eventually be marginalized by cheaper, or free, competing products.  But 
that's not the way things are supposed to work in a monopolistic society....

50 years? Well, let's do a little tally:

- everyone has a home phone, but no one uses them. They drive up to your house 
to talk to you. 

- livestock have the right-of-way, and if you hit a cow on the road with your 
car, you owe the rancher a new cow. Never mind your mangled car, too bad.

- people who own pickups and SUVs actually drive them off-road, and do work 
with them

- Most shops close for lunch, weekends, and hunting season

- 4-H and FFH kids kill and butcher animals, and no one protests

- just try to find some tofu

Yep, it's a different time zone, all right!

  I lived in southeast Idaho for a decade. In addition to this, the high
schools closed for the first two weeks of hunting season because all the
teachers and students were gone. :-)

  Of course, if you stopped your truck on the side of the road, _every_
vehicle to come by (both of them that day) would stop to ask if you needed
help. We used to go to the hot springs in the Little Lost River valley: 105
miles from home with only 1 stop sign in between. The last 45 miles were on
dirt roads with no signs and a busy day was when we saw one other vehicle --
all day.

  Used to go hunting in the Sawtooths and White Cloud ranges. Miles back
from the highway to Challis. the nearest place, Saturday Mountain resort,
had a permenant population of 5.

  Loved it there. But, no jobs and no social life for a single guy (unless
you like sheep). :-)

It's not that simple, that's the condensed version. Us computering deities 
make it look easy. :P The usual steps are:

- configure Ethernet settings. In Debian, /etc/network/interfaces and 
/etc/resolv.conf.  Most Linuxes have a nice network configuration utility. I 
don't believe Verizon or Qwest make you use PPPoE, which is good.

- set up firewall. Absolutely insane to not have one. For a single PC running 
no public services, all major Linuxes come with nice firewall setup 
utilities.

- set up gateway, if you want to share with multiple machines

I have an old Pentium for my gateway machine. It has two NICs. 

DSL modem -> gateway -> 4-port switch -> other machines

Don't expect any help from the telcos. Despite Unix and Linux being the 
backbones of the Internet, they still think it's a Winduhs world. Even the 
excellent local ISPs in the Portland area are spotty in their Linux support.

You want to be a little careful lumping all the lies in together. 
WorldCom lied by shifting operating expenses into capital expenses that 
they could depreciate over time, thus making current year figures look 
better, even though it meant potentially paying taxes when they didn't 
have to.

Microsoft, as i understand it, was going the other direction, shifting 
current revenues into future years. Thus, they were likely trying to 
hide oversized profits into the future (ie now) when they knew they'd 
lose grip on the monopoly. More significantly, it would defer tax 
payments into the future if ever.

Where's the outrage?

Aye.  That was just an attempt to make Free Software look amateurish.

While I'm being opinionated, can I say that of the MLM's I use (and
compared to MLM's I run), I hate Mailman the most at the moment?

Besides that I dislike any non-web app nearly requiring a web interface
to operate, has anybody noticed that it sends you your password in
*plain text* every month? Which, of course means it is *stored* in plain
text. In PLUG's installation, this is *somewhat* mitigated, I notice, by
drizzle being set up to attempt ESMTP TLS (which I honor), but in my
experience us paranoid types are few and far between.

Plus, if I know or can guess your subscription address (which is
easy, because by default Mailman is very strict about your From: and
Return-Path: addressing) I can get information about current
subscription options by submitting your address in "Edit Options". And,
of course, invoke another plain text password delivery if I want.

In addition, its digest mode is simply concatenating all the messages
together. A good MLM would MIME sub-bundle them so that you can pick and
reply individually, rather than (as seen above) quoting "the list" as
having said something.

Mailman's web archives are nicer than average, though.

I've run a mailing list that had at it's peak 1500 subscriptions, and of
all the software I've used for it, I ended up like ezmlm-idx immensely.
*That*, however, invokes another holy war (qmail), I'll not respond to.

(Now that I've established the "black mark" on my reputation, I'll go
hide in the corner and pretend nothing happened.)

Even if I was wrong and you were right, the idea of deferring your
obligations to public life (taxes, etc.) is outrageously anti-social and
evil... but that's not even the issue.

This information is a bit old at this point, but if you read Bill
Parrish's analysis of Microsoft's SEC filings and financial reports, you
will see what I meant.

The general idea is that they report(ed) stock options sold to employees
as earnings and not as liabilities.

As I wrote, the report is quite old, but it's accurate for the time period
it covers.

Making a living here is difficult. The area has been depressed for a long 
time. But even so, people work hard to stay here, because they love it. A lot 
of them are descendants of the original homesteaders. I love it, and I'm glad 
I could live here before I got too old and feeble to handle it. (it's rather 
humbling to see a 75-year old woman the size of Jiminy Cricket sling bales of 
hay like they were nothing)

I'm looking into various Linux point of sale, inventory, and accounting 
programs. A good retail/service business package would be an attractive deal, 
I think, if I could put together something that doesn't cost a mint. There's 
quite a few commercial Linux POS systems, but they cost big bucks. The main 
competition is elderly versions of Quickbooks.

Lovely stuff. Glad the lifestyle is still available.

OT: Don't forget about BB guns and .22s for kids being seen as wholesome, 
healthy and otherwise normal, and then graduating them to their first 20ga. 
or rifle later on.

I wonder if there are clusters of Linux users big enough in places like 
Vernonia, Mist, Clatskanie, Ranier, etc. that folks might meet (3 - 6 people, 
sounds like) on a monthly basis out there...

I don't think you could ever possibly repay humanity for the enormous work
that was put into the knowledge and experience you have gained from
civilization.

Now that you put it this way, I guess any attempts to repay do seem
woefully inadequate... On the other hand, this also means that a bit less
of an attempt won't make a noticeable difference, since it's not ever
possible to come even close to success in this. In fact, no repayment at
all won't make any difference either, since I can't repay anyway. That
makes me feel a whole lot better. Now back to my "Handbook for Evil
Overlords"...

Well, I personally don't believe that you are "repaying" anything.  Guy
was the one looking for a way to get out of his responsibilities.

I give because I want others to have.

Subject: [PLUG] Apache And French Characters
Message-ID: <20031023190921.1c48b309.jason@vancleve.com>

Problem:  my blog has a some French language in it, using characters like the C with the squiggle underneath, and accented E's.

But they show up as question marks when viewed from my Mandrake (8.1, I think) server.  They also show up as ?'s when viewed from my new laptop (gentoo 1.4-rc4), which has the latest versions of apache and resin (I use servlets).  However, the characters display correctly when served from my workstation (Linux From Scratch), which I installed at least a year ago.

This obviously isn't a browser problem, so I don't know whether to suspect apache, resin, or something deeper in the OS.  Any clues?

Merci en avance,

I think otherwise - that if it's a defined fact that you cannot win, then it's 
a foolish dissipation to even try to play. Better to channel one's available 
talent into endeavors which best seem achievable.

I believe that it's possible to be 'paid-up' socially. One phrase which comes 
to mind is being free enough that you owe no one even the time of day. This 
is a freedom which means that the courtesy & assistence you extend to others 
is entirely of your free will, as opposed to in exchange for a wage or a tax 
payment, or a mortgage owed, or a grudge.

Maybe that's part of how Open Source works - it's not owed, it's given.

Depending on the DSL provider, that may literally be all they had to do. 
My DSL provider's setup is such that all I have to do is plug in the modem
to a NIC and set an IP for it.  If they had a DHCP server set up, I
wouldn't even have to set up an IP address.

Such things are generally fairly distro-independent.  If it isn't a setup
like above, odds are it uses PPPoE.  While there may be utilities in each
distro to set this stuff up, it's all the same thing in the end.

I wouldn't suggest switching to RedHat, especially since their
distribution seems to be undergoing some fairly intrusive changes at the
moment.

I would suggest switching away from Mandrake, though.

As for plug-and-play USB devices, that's really a kernel/hotplug thing,
and any distro can take advantage of all the others' hardware.  I don't
think most DSL modems these days are USB-based, anyway.  AOL's DSL modems
tend to be switching to offering both USB and ethernet plugs.  My ISP's
DSL modems are all ethernet.  I don't know how USB DSL modems work for
Linux, however.

You don't have to go quite so far for all that.  It sounds an awful lot

I don't see anything wrong with target practice, it's good fun.  I don't
think many folks out in the boonies use BB guns, though.  I think most
folks learn to fire with .22's.  And 12-guages for skeet shooting.  :-)

There are two Linux users in St. Paul (population: 354).  Hope Carla has
better luck than that.  :-)

I'm not quite sure which combinations are going on
here but assuming it really is a server problem, try
comparing the encoding used by the servers, make sure
it's iso-8859-1. Unicode may work, but I'm not sure,
if it's ascii, it probably doesn't work.

You can always use HTML escapes to display the
characters:

accent name followed by a semicolin.

Not as such.  A format is just a way of arranging info.  Can you patent
the order in which you shelve your books?  No.  Can a friend figure out
how you shelved your books and do the same with hers?  Yes.  However...

Adobe has released PDF as a public spec, so it doesn't even take
reverse-engineering (which has its own legal issues) to figure out how to
read and write it.  Adobe still gets plenty of income because Adobe
Distiller is the best-known way to make PDFs, and most nontechnical folks
aren't interested in the risk of trying another method.
(The same mechanism applies to MS Office.)

And that brings us to the However... part.  The exceptions to all of this
are encryption and copy-protection, which are protected by the DMCA.

The first use of the DMCA that I'm aware of was when RealNetworks sued
StreamBox over their "VCR" program for Windows.  StreamBox had figured out
the secret handshake between Real Player and Real Server, and had written
a program that would pretend to be a copy of Real Player, but instead of
decompressing and showing the stream, it would save it as-is for later
playback, much like a VCR does with TV signals.

RealNetworks won, claiming that the handshake was an encrypted copy-
protection device, and thus off-limits under the DMCA.  Similar cases
involving DVD-CSS (which actually has nothing to do with copy-protection)
and an eBook vendor (who'd used Adobe's Rot13 example as their encryption)
have been successfully brought under the DMCA.

So, if you're still reading, we get to the Big Scary Thing:  Encrypted
copy-protected Office documents.  MS is promising this Real Soon Now,
which means that (a) it will be *illegal* to figure out how to read/write
the latest Office documents without MS' say-so and (b) it means there'll
be documents that can't be leaked or used as evidence and have a specified
lifetime.  Just think: no more government or corporate scandals, because
all details will be secret forevermore.  No more history but the official
version, because there won't be much left to research.

And then there's TCPA and the broadcast-flag rule...

Write your congresscritter regularly,
  Aaron

Huh?  There are purposes to do things other than winning and losing.  And
this isn't a GAME.

You can't ever pay it all back, so you shouldn't try?

You can't ever be perfect, so should you stop trying to be the best you
can?

So your perfect world not only contains no responsibilities, but also no
effort?

It's already of your own free will.

As for "the law", I don't give a fig for that.

Carla,

  Let's chat off the list about the G/L I'm using. I bought a source code

  Anyone else see "Non-Sequitur" (the comic strip) this morning? It was one
of Wiley's funnier ones. A frumpy looking woman is in the butcher shop
asking, "Have anything that died of natural causes?" The sign is, "When
vegans fall off the wagon."

Um, it sounds to me like a font problem.  Are you using a font that
includes those characters in the proper positions?

And that reminds me, is there a good font viewer with basic features
similar to the old Windows Character Map?  I don't do font stuff like I
used to, but I remember using Character Map quite a bit.

That sounds like the right idea, but how do I check this?  By "servers" do you mean apache and resin (which are sharing the same config' files on all my machines) or the basic linux config's?

That would be cumbersome, at best.  My blog is read from an XML file by a servlet, so escapes in the XML are translated before the servlet even sees them, and I'd have to translate them again on the fly.  I can tell you the characters are making it to the servlet unmunged, so I rather suspect apache here.

                             SuitWatch--October 23

  Views on Linux in Business

  --by Doc Searls, Senior Editor of Linux Journal

   The third item is an October 19 Associated Press story:
   http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/144617_source20.html by Justin
   Pope. Pope writes about the growing number of governments making
   open-source and open standards a policy for purchase and
   implementation of new technology. Making current news is Eric Kriss,
   Massachusetts' administration and finance secretary, who told the
   state's CTO to adopt exactly that policy when spending the state's $80
   million annual technology budget.

   And Massachusetts isn't alone. According to the story, the Initiative
   for Software Choice:
   http://softwarechoice.org "has tracked 70 different open-source
   reference proposals in 24 countries". And that organization is hardly
   friendly to open source. According to the Asian Open Source Centre:
   http://www.asiaosc.org/enwiki/page/Initiative_for_Software_Choice.html
   :

     The so-called Initiative for Software Choice is an organization
     funded by a large international group of (mostly proprietary)
     software companies. These companies typically have a vested
     interest in the continuation of the proprietary software model. The
     organization's strategy is to put pressure on any government body
     that proposes open-source or free software be used in preference to
     proprietary software.

     The Software Choice part of the name can be considered to mean "we
     don't mind if you have the choice between proprietary and free or
     open-source software, but your government never should try to
     influence you away from proprietary software."

   The Software Choice Policy Tracker link is broken, as are about half
   of the links on the front page of the site. One that isn't broken
   brings up a .pdf version of a letter addressed to Mitt Romney,
   Governor of Massachusetts. It begins:

     The Initiative for Software Choice (ISC, www.softwarechoice.org) --
     a global coalition with over 260 software companies and
     associations -- is writing to express our concern that the open
     source software mandate recently announced by Secretary of
     Administration and Finance, Eric Kriss would incalculably harm
     Massachusetts public administration, its citizens, and its
     information technology (IT) industry and workers because it will
     eviscerate software choice presently available to the Commonwealth
     of Massachusetts. As a result, the ISC -- which is managed by the
     Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA, which
     represents 13,350 member companies including over 175 IT companies
     in Massachusetts) -- requests a meeting with your [sic] or your
     designee at your earliest convenience so that we may learn more
     about this policy and provide our input.

     The ISC strongly supports the development and adoption of all kinds
     of software: be it open source software (OSS), hybrid or
     proprietary. For this reason, we believe that mandatory government
     regulations, which give preference to certain kinds of software,
     weaken the overall software marketplace, biasing the choice of
     viable software options available to public authorities. Only when
     all software options are available can the specific needs of each
     IT project be met, driven by a flexible range of factors such as
     cost, reliability, security, functionality and availability. The
     ISC is aware of no barriers to unfettered software choice in
     Massachusetts. In fact, at this present time, the Commonwealth of
     Massachusetts can rightfully choose any type of software/platform
     it wants for its IT needs. As such, no legal obstacles stop its
     public administrators from going into the market and getting the
     best solution for a given challenge.

   The ISC is laying out a bit of a red herring here. That's because in
   many states technology often, by law or standard practice, is
   obtainable officially only through a procurement process that respects
   vendors as the only legitimate technology sources. In other words, you
   can only buy software and then only from vendors. As Tom Adelstein
   explained in his Linux Access in State and Local Government series:
   http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6990 on the Linux Journal
   site, work needs to be done at several different levels to open
   government to open-source procurement, whether the goods have any
   costs or come from vendors. A list of virtues involved in this process
   is provided by Bruce Perens through his Sincere Choice:
   http://www.sincerechoice.org effort, created in response to the
   Software Choice initiative.

   What gets lost here, on both sides of the argument, is that the terms
   proprietary and open source are neither opposite nor mutually
   exclusive. Take MySQL:
   http://www.mysql.com/ for example. The company fact sheet makes the
   matter plain:

     MySQL's company values and business strategy hinge on the open
     source software philosophy that software should be free and
     available to all. MySQL owns all rights to the MySQL server source
     code, the MySQL trademark and the mysql.com domain worldwide.
     Through this copyright, the company protects MySQL's integrity and
     reputation as a fully open source, superior database....

     MySQL's business strategy leverages the MySQL name and copyright as
     well as the company's deep expertise in the MySQL database
     software. The company's revenues are driven by the sale of
     commercial licenses, as well as strategic partnerships, consulting,
     customer support and other services. Commercial Licenses: MySQL
     employs a dual-licensing business model. The MySQL database is
     available at no cost under the GPL free software/open source
     license, and MySQL also provides commercial, non-GPL licenses to
     organizations that don't want to be bound by the GPL.

     With the availability of the commercial license option, leading
     companies are now using the high-performance MySQL database without
     the limitations of the GPL in the enterprise, as well as embedding
     MySQL with major software, hardware and other electronic devices.

     MySQL's dual-licensing structure supports its open source user
     community with a sustainable business model, and this community, in
     turn, is the engine behind the company's commercial business.

   In other words, it's free as in beer and speech, under the GPL; and
   yet it is completely owned and therefore proprietary. This means the
   company also is free to charge you for a license if you want the goods
   and services that come with that license and as long as what you do
   with those goods and services remains private and outside the scope of
   the GPL. This covers a lot of possibilities.

   MySQL's explosive success completely invalidates the beliefs that
   ownership and freedom are mutually exclusive and that you need
   restrictive licenses if you hope to make something valuable enough to
   sell. Scarcity and value are not tied to each other after all. Why
   make matters complicated for everybody? Expose your code, turn it
   free, let the world improve on it and sell the results in the form of
   software SKUs and paid relationships with customers of all sizes. Have
   it both ways, and then some.

Message-ID: <1066964779.1114.88.camel@farm-libranet>

HI

Can someone explain why sync acts like this...
Delayed that is.....

Sorry about the long post but,......

The thought here is
Create a file and it will consume some disk space.

Well, it does.

In my case that is 4K.  <I expected this>
We could do better..  Why don't we.
Checking the man page for mk2fs I could specify 
a 1, 2, or 4 k block size....
Most install program just go ahead and format based
on some ????? <I don't know what>

Back to the subject..

After creating the file...
It is not written to the disk....
Even with sync.<At least not right away>
I thought sync would force the issue.
Why not????

Here is the log.... of my activity  see below for 
questions.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So here is the issue..

File data size is 14 bytes.

Stored in 4k Blockes.

Except for . which is stored in 512 <?>

The first file I created ... Line 9 was written to disk
immediately and used 4 1k blocks...

The second file I created... Line 23 was not written to
disk until I had done  sync on line 32, 36, and 47.

Again the second file data size was 14 bytes stored in 4K.

The question is ...behavior of sync....
What am I missing.


SYNC(1)                        FSF                        SYNC(1)

NAME
       sync - flush filesystem buffers

SYNOPSIS
       sync [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       Force changed blocks to disk, update the super block.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

And now for a comment from someone who painfully is aware.
DO NOT WAIT! If you want to build this layout, do it now.
You may be dead tomorrow. 
And try to figure out how to use Linux to run the switches and keep
track of speed and distance between trains.

Now, I've had my say from a moral stand point and kept it on topic as

No, no, no.  See above.  The same browser displays the page correctly
when served from my workstation.  Change the url to my server, and I see false characters.  'Tis a server issue, my lad.

I can suggest jedit, which has a character map plugin.  Click on a character, and it's inserted into your file.  (Though it's a long shot you'd be willing to switch editors just for that.)

Like hi,

I'm using File - New - Label to make labels in OO 1.1. Anyone know how to 
change the font? It uses Times 12. I don't want Times 12. Yes I can edit each 
fricken label individually, I don't want to do that. (It's been suggested to 
me about 15 times now, and I don't want to hear it again. And yes I tried 
'select all')

I think if I change the default font in OO Writer that will work, but I 
can't even figure out how to do that.

Thanks!

Good.  It's about time Microsoft felt some market 
pressure.  If they'd implement a respectable 
environment to run the proprietary software they want 
to write under Linux, they could maintain an adequate 
audience. Especially if they work on their quality 
for once and abandon anti open source attitudes.  
Some companies just need to get with the twenty 
first century already ;-)

Their biggest mistake is forcing people into high cost 
upgrades that don't see a need for them.  They've made 
obsolete an awfully large number or Windows Certified 
people well before that needed to happen.

I don't have much sympathy for the company considering 
it hasn't tried to find out if it can join the Linux 
community successfully instead of attacking it all 
the time.  Lying to the public about NT while secretly
using some Linux internally isn't exactly above board

I think you can go Format->Styles->Catalog, find the "text" style and 
click on the "modify" button - I am an OO novice though and don't know 
if that'll work for labels.

Okay, time to stop before I move from Sandy back to Gardnerville, Nevada. 

When I was a kid, EVERYBODY waved when passing on the road, highway or not. When 
you pulled up behind somebody on the road going faster, they'd pull over and 
drive on the shoulder and let you pass.

Those days are gone, and I really miss them. My kids will never see that and it 
makes me sad.

By servers I mean apache and resin.

I don't know anything about resin, but in apache the
directive is AddDefaultCharset. In my httpd.conf file
it looks like this:

AddDefaultCharset ISO-8859-1

I also have a whole bunch of 'AddCharset foo's out
there for alternate charsets.

Also, after trying this on my system, I found I had a
similar problem that came from saving the files as
unicode, maybe you're doing something similar.

Bon chance,

  Should have a little button widget in the upper, left corner of the window
with the text "synchronize labels". Write once, implement many (that's a
WOIM, by the way). Works for me.

  Two ways of doing this. Three, actually.

  1) Follow the menus: Tools -> Options -> Text document -> Basic fonts
(Western) ... er, they may have an (Eastern) selection for those of you on
the east side of the Cascades. Then pick your fonts.

  2) Block the label text and on the whatchamacallit icon bar above the
working window, change the typeface in the drop-down list (second widget
from the left).

  3) Block label text, select Format -> Character and change the typeface
there.

That was the key, thanks Rick. It was still a wee struggle after that- it 
would not let me select all the text in the individual label frame, but only 
one line at a time. But at least I could change the whole page of labels with 
one click of the  'synchronize' button.

I applaud you for figuring it out, I've combed the Help from one end to the 
other, and I never saw anything about the 'synchronize' button.

OK, there is a moderately easy way to do this:

File -> New -> Label
On the Labels tab, type in your text and select the label type
On the Options tab, check 'Synchronize'
Click "New Document'

This creates a full sheet of labels. (note that you can have a full sheet of 
the same label, or a single label, or do a merge with a list) I'm making a 
full sheet of return address labels.

OO uses frames, not a table. Now edit the 
first label on the page. It can take a bit of futzing- if the font is too 
large, making the text bigger than the frame, any text not completely visible 
cannot be selected. So shrink the fonts that show until the hidden stuff 
comes up into view. 

When label #1 is done to taste, click the "synchronize labels" button, which 
should be in a floating menu.

Now for the fun part- let's say you want to make a perty return address label 
with a picture of Tux on it. Use a larger label, like Avery 5160. After 
getting your text the way you like, do "Insert -> Graphics -> From File". The 
picture will automatically be placed in a frame.  Size and place the image 
(and remember not to make a dumbnail) , then right-click on the image to 
bring a menu to adjust the text wrap. Hit 'synchronize', and there you go.

It helps to have 'View -> Non-printing characters' turned on.

  Good.

  Hehehe. Try adding a new page style and searching the 'help' system for
that. Us dummies look under "Style" for "create" or "new". Nothing there.
Turns out that it isn't documented. Someone wrote that it was under "Page -
Style", but it ain't there, either. Maybe ... some day.

  Turns out that the secret for this is to open the template for which you
want to add the new style. Then you can do it. Except, in my case, the
entire style disappeared (dispite my having "saved" it) the next time I
invoked OO.o. I'm still working on this. Sigh.

  There are a couple of folks who have written books on StarOffice and
OpenOffice. Unfortunately, their latest was written pre-1.1.0 and is out of
date when it hit the store shelves. But, there may be good stuff there. I
get most of my questions answered on the mail list (users at openoffice.org).
But, there's such a high noise to signal ratio there (too many winduhs users
and people asking, "is it really free?") that I subscribe to post a question
and unsubscribe when I get a working answer. Or a written shrug when answers
don't work.

  It does, but not very elegantly or smoothly. I reported a few bugs in the
pre-1.0 versions that were fixed in the 1.1.0 release so I'll be patient on
the other rough spots. The key is to not get splinters when working with it.

Excelsior!

  Here's a label problem that folks on the mail list solved with a kludge:
centering your text vertically on each label. I did some three-line labels
here (Avery 5260; 30 per sheet) and the text was cut off at the top of each
lable while there is a lot of space under the third line.

  In WordPerfect I used to fix this with the vertical advance feature. OO.o
does not have this. What was suggested to me (and I've not yet tried it) is
to put a single-cell table (perhaps a paramecium) on the label, enter text,
then use the table formatting feature to center the text in the cell.

Hello,

I used to work for a hosting company who had their virtuals set up in a

Is there a way to check for mail coming from that mail server, then

And to bring this on topic in a weird and disturbing way, last May in
Detroit we had a "Geeks with Guns" session just before Penguicon.  
About a dozen geeks and geekettes, including ESR, Cdr. Taco, and Illiad,
who taught newbies like Terry Pratchett and myself how to fire pistols.
My biggest regret is that I did not bring along any Micro$oft products.
Remember, when properly dealing with Microsoft Office, always wear eye
and ear protection, and hold the "installation device" so the slide
doesn't whack your hand!

Do you think a slot-load CDrom drive could be modified with an extra
strength eject mechanism, suitable for skeet shooting?

I wouldn't call that a kludge- OO is frame-oriented. (m$ word is 
page-oriented) Using parameciums (haw) is a perfectly good way to do things 
in a frame-oriented DTP or word processor.

Dear All:

I have a TNT2 video card and my monitor is made by Gem.  I just installed
RH9 on my celeron box.  It works fine.  Except that
it cannot detect my monitor make.  It won't let me probe either.
Is there any way I can force it to probe my monitor type?
I went under Systems Setting -> Display but the Probe Monitor
button is hot.

With my TNT2 video card, it won't let me turn on hardware acceleration.  My 
video
card does support that.  Is there anything I need to do to ask RH9 to allow
my video card to make use of hardware acceleration?

thanks any pointers.

Wow!  That would be great!

That would probably be considerably less expensive than any other
mechanical skeet shooters out there... not that throwing them out there
by hand is really that difficult.

Nobody else had any obvious answers, so I'll take a few shots at this.

No.

Decreasing block size increases the number of inodes required to
describe the disk. By decreasing block size, depending on the total size
of the disk, you may be *decreasing* available space. It can also affect
performance due to increased number of inode dereferences. Less than 4K
should generally only be used in embedded setups.

Just always 4K, AFAIK.

Directory "size" is fs dependent and rarely has anything to do with
actual size on disk. I forget what it is in ext2, but in reiser it's
related to the number of tree nodes (internal to the filesystem
structures) below the directory.

ext2 preallocates block runs for files. Which should explain why 4 were
"used".

I *believe* it was synced to physical disk, using one of the preallocated
blocks.

The backend just took a while to decide to preallocate some
more. That's my theory. I'm only familiar with filesystems down to
/just/ about where the code starts. :-)

Remember, this isn't DOS and FAT we're talking about here. There's a lot
that goes on behind the scenes and what you see from userspace (and in
particular 'df') isn't what's physically represented on disk. Another
variable would be: there might've been log activity in the background
that triggered the second 4 blocks.

Also, if you're so concerned about slack space in your file system, you
might consider one of the more advanced filesystems such as reiser (JFS,
too?) that have tail packing -- small files are stored in unused space
in directory inodes and take zero blocks "on disk".

  Hey, if you live out in the sticks, make you own cluster of users...

  I met a guy in Bisby, AZ last year that was doing bang-up business
installing Linux on old broken Windows 9[58] boxen.  Bisby is located way
down in southern AZ.  It's a bit low rent.  The locals often cannot buy new
machines to run the latest offering from M$.  A modern RedHat 9 installation
is a hell of a better system than Windows 9[58].

  The guy was making enough money doing Linux installs and support to pay
rent and his bar tab.  He said his customers were *very* happy with their
Linux systems.

  I'd like to point out the immortal words of Bob Young (former RedHat CEO),
as quoted by the NY Times in 1998.

  "My job is not to compete with Microsoft," Young stresses. "It's to lower
the value of the operating system market. Microsoft makes $5 billion in
operating system sales. If I get that market, I automatically make it a $500
million market."

  It's been taking a little longer for Bob's prediction to come true than I
expected...

Rob,

  I'm not sure I understand what you want, but I think this would do it.

  In your header_checks (and/or any domain name checking list you have) put
the user at domain.com at the top with the action, OK, tabbed after it. Then
put all domains you want to reject below, with a '550 reject' action.

Me neither, here a few shots in the dark:
- Try diffing some config files
- Look at the source on the client and see what's
exactly is served up.
- try serving a plain html file with some French
characters. (Interestingly enough, using a test page
on my server with the sentance <<C'est en fran?ais.>>
helped me find the source of one of my apache problems
which I wouldn't have figured out had it not been
plain HTML).

Thanks for the reply..

I almost missed it.. <you changed the subject line>

I actually am running reiser...

I  just justed  ext2 as an example.. for file size.

Is there a good read on <howto, info, ??> on file systems?

Thanks again

Did this change with Postfix's 2.0 release?

'cause in the header_checks examples I have in my main.cf file, it
specifies the OK doesn't do anything.  Saying OK to the first check is
the same as if that first check weren't there.

What I was hoping to avoid is listing all domains the server has
virtuals for.  There's a lot.  But if it is a top down thing, maybe I
can say rob at domain.com is OK, then any other mail coming from that
server is a REJECT.

I always want to check first since screwing up and breaking my mail
server for a few minutes isn't something I want to do.  I've done it
before, and you wonder what you missed.  :)

Thanks,
Rob

Rob,

  Perhaps. I don't recall the differences from 1.x.

  This is what /ete/postfix/main.cf here shows:

# The header_checks parameter specifies an optional table with patterns
# that each logical message header is matched against, including
# headers that span multiple physical lines.  Patterns are matched
# in the specified order, and the search stops upon the first match.
# When a pattern matches, what happens next depends on the associated
# action that is specified in the right-hand side of the table:
#
# REJECT the entire message is rejected.
# REJECT text.... The text is sent to the originator.
# IGNORE the header line is silently discarded.
# WARN   the header is logged (not rejected) with a warning message.

  Nothing specific about OK. IIRC, when I asked on the postfix mail list I
was told that OK worked there, too.

  I also have a domain name file that's checked. I have the same white list
there, too:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
        permit_mynetworks,
        reject_unauth_destination,
        check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/badip,
        check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/badaddr,

NVidia cards have been know to lock up the system when they are probed,

I don't know how RH9 configures the xserver, but you need to pick out
the video driver manually.  The xserver configuration should be in
/etc/X11/XF86Config-4, and I believe the nv drivers should work with
your card, but to get hardware acceleration, you will need to install
the binary drivers from NVidia.  I'm not sure what the RPM package name,
or tarball name is (I used a .deb), but it unpacked an executable file
called 

/nvidia-graphics-drivers-1.0.4496.origx/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-4496-pkg0.run

which used my kernel source to compile a module for the xfree86 server. 
It looked for other sources of the module, so it may work differently
for you.

HTH,

Derek Loree

You can download the source for "ng-spice" from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice .

The project appears moribund, but it does appear to work with the stock
BSIM3 model.  It is built on top of Berkeley 3f5 .

If you want the full-tilt HSPICE compatable commercial closed source Big
Kahuna version of SPICE (you will need this to be compatable with the
models for real fabs as opposed to class projects) you should probably
be looking at Silvaco Smartspice from www.silvaco.com .  Many K$, dongled,
but cheaper than HSPICE, and runs on Linux.  If you want to see how it
works, let me know and I will bring dongle and laptop to a meeting.

Rich,

Does the above line allow you to have a list of IP address that you hate and reject
them?  It seems to.  And a list of email people you dislike?

Thanks,

Josh

Hi Rich,

Sounds interesting. I was already thinking if I can't find something 
ready-made, there must be people out there somewheres putting their own 
systems together. Share the cost, share the work- it could happen.

My requirements, in addition to having the right functionality, are moderate 
cost to users, and GPL-licensed, or similar. You read about Appgen going 
belly-up, stranding users and customers?

Josh,

  Yes and no.

  I have two files: one with IP addresses (1701 entries) and one with domain
names (255 entries). They work like a charm.

  For rejection of specific user at domain.com (of which there are very, very
few), I use an entry in header_checks, such as these two:

/lopez.*@aol\.com/                              REJECT Rule H10
/^From: FamilyValues4U at Lycos\.com/              REJECT Rule H11

(Haven't seen those in a few years now.)

  Anyway, with these and the extensive list of RBLs checked the spam that
make it through the flaming moat, thick castle walls and accurate archers in
the shooting positions are fewer than a half-dozen most days. I can live
with that. And, as the slimes come up with new attempts to obfuscate key
words, I add those to the filters.

  ... and the beat goes on.

Ah oui, ca marche!  So I'll have to take another look at my resin configuration; just hope it's not some weird problem with the apache module interface.  Wouldn't have a clue how to fix that.

Thanks Rich.  I should find a way for my port sniffer to add the IP to the email
list as well as the firewall.  I guess one question is where did you get the IP
list?  Something you collected over the years or a known "mean IP number" list?

Josh,

  Didn't take years, just a few months. Every time I received a spam from
Asia I found the owner of that IP address block and entered every single
address (usually /8 or /16, not all four dot-quads needed). Time consuming
up front, but time saving over the long term.

  I'd be happy to provide my badaddr and badip lists, but only individually
and not on the archived mail list.

You folks count yourselves lucky that guns can be found in your area.
I moved to CT last year and let me tell you, guns are basically
outlawed.  Fortunately I brought my rifle and shotgun with me so I
didn't have to have all the whack-O's staring at me as I buy a shiny
new gun.

In order to buy a pistol in this state you have to pay fees up the
wazzoo just to get a permit to buy a pistol.  You can't purchase one
until you have a permit (which requires photos and fingerprints!!!)
AHHHG!  I'm going to implode soon...

A very tired of the liberals,

I've tried two different hard drives, and both times Disk Druid complains that 
there are bad blocks on the drives. This seems very unlikely. /sbin/badblocks 
doesn't find any errors, so I'm going ahead with the installation. Anyone

I've heard complaints about Disk Druid false-alarming before.  I would
say it's safer to trust /sbin/badblocks.

Message-ID: <Law12-F74lzIXhGJPoh00001bad@hotmail.com>

I'm trying to install slackware on a machine I have here.
The installer will see my SCSI drive, but won't immediately treat it as the 
target installation. cfdisk, for instance, will try to edit the partition 
table of the CD-ROM, which ... won't work. =)
I can both read from and write to the drive. The requisite partition is 
marked bootable (A large ReiserFS partition). The drive is not out of space 
when I try to install lilo.
What's going on? The installer wouldn't let me write lilo to a bootable 
floppy, either. Is my installation media corrupted?

Matthias

other GNU electronic cad tools, there are pointers at
http://www.geda.seul.org/
Also check:   http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu/cgi-bin/w3-msql/vlsi/CADfree.html

Probably the most interesting of these is Icarus Verilog.  I'm not a logic
designer, but I do need an HDL simulator from time to time.  There are also
some open source logic blocks out there.

I am interested in good schematic drawing packages to replace Orcad. 
I hope to get time someday to look at gschem.

Here's a kinda bonehead way to do it (too sleepy for clever):

@domainparts = split '.', $fqdn;
if ( $string_to_compare  =~ m/$domainparts[-2]\.$domainparts[-1]/ ) {
	print "It matches, motherfucker.\n";
} else {
	print "It don't match, bitch.\n";
}

That should work, right?  I have to sleep now.

This has been the strangest night ... ever.

I've gotten my posted values from a web page form manipulated and

The O'Reilly I book I have to use seems to be from 1995, fairly old.
It looks like I need information on how to write a perl based socket

socket and have it be the shell script that changes the firewalls

I have an an example of a crude fortune program via a socket at the

Spamassassin has been working for me, but I have not been able to figure
out how to view the caught spam to go to a file that evolution or any
mail reader can read.  Using the recipe below, the mail is going to
~/mail/caughtspam but how do I view this in Evolution?

Also, procmail does not appear to be logging.  Nothing is getting put

if you're trying to distribute the information to other boxes that are
running, say apache (or some other webserver).....

it might be far easier to use existing services than to write a
client/server socket framework...on the box with the data, you could
simply use LWP::UserAgent or something similar to send the data via HTTP
POST to the remote machines; or if the remote boxes are going to just
stuff the data into a database, and you have you network set up in a way
that you are comfortable with.... You could use DBI and let the machine
with the data just handle the insertion rather than putting an extra
step in the process.

OR....

if ya wanna get really buzzword compliant, you could use SOAP ( Some
Other American Pimp .. j/k) by way of the modules in SOAP::Lite and do
your stuff with that.  The SOAP way would be the easiest way to get a
"Processing Framework" going. SOAP::Lite gives you a bunch of tools for
client/server/processing/etc.

If you go so far as to start creating an entire framework for these data
sets, you might want to configure your editor to handle large
programming tasks as well.  I trust you are using vim or something
similar. You can do something called 'folding' with it, and it can be a
godsend. add the following lines to ~/.vimrc:

:set fdm=marker
"C/C++/Java/PHP folding
:map :L i// {{{
:map :R i// }}}
"python/perl folding
:map _L A# {{{
:map _R A# }}}

after defining a 'sub' in Perl, do the following:

[type]sub subRoutineName [hit ESC][type _L][hit the 'o' key]
[type]{
[type]	my $asf = shift || 'fooga';
[type]	...
[type]} [hit 'enter']
[hit ESC][type _R][hit the 'o' key]

voila! now, when you reopen the file in vim, you should see something
like this:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

my $programName = 'FoldingTest.pl';
&printProgramName($programName);

+--  6 lines: sub printProgramName #-------------------------

to open the function, move your cursor to the '+' and move right one
character (it will automatically open)

below is what it looks like when it is opened:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

my $programName = 'FoldingTest.pl';
&printProgramName($programName);

sub printProgramName # {{{
{
    my $p = shift || "I don't know";
    print "My program is named $p\n";
}
# }}}

Werd...

You need the LOG="" to be in your rule. Here is what mine looks like. If
you need evolution to read your caughtpsam folder, then try editing your
~/.mailboxlist file and add that folder there.

Actually, I altered it some and I got it to log to my homedir and it is
clearly handling the mail as I want procmail to.  So that is not a real
problem.

With my current promailrc file, procmail creates the file
$HOME/mail/caughtmail and then appends it.  There is no folder.  If I
send the mail to $HOMEDIR/evolution/local/caughtspam then files called
msg.<WHATEVER> are put there.  In either case, I cannot read them with
Evolution.  What I want is a general solution for all users, regardless
of the mail client they use.

As far as mailboxlist, I don't have a file or folder by that name.

If you want procmail to create a Maildir folder instead of a mbox files
add a trailing / like so...

$MAILDIR/junk/

I don't use evolution so this is only a guess.. I'd try creating a new
account in evolution then have procmail forward mail to that accounts
folder. Something like your $HOMEDIR/evolution/local/caughtspam.

The real issue for me right now is making it so the spam goes to a mail
reader neutral format.  That is so I can set my Evolution to read it in
my file and my other users to set their mail reader to read it in their
own file.  

If it were just Evolution, I can forget the caughtspam or procmail thing
and have Evolution filter on the spam header.  What I would like is a
general solution.

If you've got a spare box, could you try RedHat 9?  I believe that default 
charset for the whole thing is utf-8 which should provide support more or 
less automatically for most any character. It may be less than more in 
practice.  Utf-8 support is less than universal.

If you want to write it as a programming exercise, that's cool. If 
you'd like to use one of the many client-server modules on CPAN, also 
cool. Here's a selection:

http://search.cpan.org/~mnaguib/EasyTCP-0.25/

http://search.cpan.org/~rhandom/Net-Server-0.85/

My preference is XML-RPC as done in the RPC::XML package on CPAN.  Very simple 
and easy to use.  Just make calls remotely and it works.  I think that things 
like SOAP are far too heavy (CORBA over HTTP with XML as the encoding??).

If you want one end to be a shell script, perhaps you should look at running 
stuff inside inetd.  Inetd maps sockets to STDIN/STDOUT very nicely and lets 
you make dirt-simple server programs without any socket code at all.  Did I 
misunderstand this?

Best,
Kyle

I'm curious about using xinetd now to do this.  I believe I can
put the socket in /etc/services and then write an xinetd 
file for it, but what's the syntax?  Is this similar to 
remapping standard input to a socket?  What do I need in my perl
script on the end serving the variables up to feed them to the
socket on the other end?

Yep, service name in /etc/services along with port number, type (tcp/udp) etc.  
'man 5 services' will tell you how that works.

'man 5 xinetd.conf' will give you all the info you need to write an addition 
to xinetd.conf.

inetd/xinetd do basically the same thing.  They listen on the ports described 
in the conf file.  When something connects (for TCP ports), they look up what 
other program to start and remap the incoming side of the socket to STDIN of 
that program and the outgoing side to STDOUT.  The program is run once per 
connection and should terminate when done processing that one connection.

In your program, you just read/write to STDIN/STDOUT.  Just like you were 
running it on the command line.  It makes testing a snap.

inetd/xinetd are not meant for services that get hit a lot.  You really, 
really would not want to run a web server through it!  However, it is 
reasonable to run other things through it.

Here's a shell script that tells you who is online:

----------------------
#!/bin/sh

who
----------------------

Put that in /usr/local/bin or something.  Lash that up into xinetd.conf and it 
will return the output of the 'who' command to the thing connecting to the 
socket.

If you need a really simple way to test the client side, I would suggest the 
netcat tool (often called nc, but so are a lot of other things).  Search on 
Google for it.  On SuSE machines, it is called netcat.

$ netcat localhost <who port>

That will return the output of the above script if you've got xinetd 
configured correctly.

Don't forget to SIGHUP xinetd if you change the config!  That's my favorite 
way to confuse myself for a while.

inetd-style stuff is insanely useful for small hacks, but don't use it for 
high-volume services.  It can be tightened down (in xinetd.conf) pretty well 
too.

Best,
Kyle

Upgrading to the same version of perl worked.  My web server
must still be using the old 5.6.0 directory.

Redhat 7.2 seemed to take 7.3's perl just fine.

#!/usr/bin/perl

use Net::EasyTCP;

   #
   # Create a new client and connect to a server
   #
   $client = new Net::EasyTCP(
           mode            =>      "client",
           host            =>     'web.robinson-west.com',
           port            =>      2345,
   )
   || die "ERROR CREATING CLIENT: $@\n";


   # Send and receive complex objects/strings/arrays/hashes by reference

   %hash = ("Send 1" => "Reply 1" , "Send 2" => "Reply 2");
   $client->send(\%hash) || die "ERROR SENDING: $@\n";
   $reply = $client->receive() || die "ERROR RECEIVING: $@\n";
   foreach (keys %{$reply}) {
            print "Received key: $_ = $reply->{$_}\n";
   }

I don't get the %hash line.  Is $client->send a function call?
I've never seen => before in a perl script. 

What was actually send verses received here?

OO and KDE need boatloads of RAM, so you need a swap file. When you boot 
Knoppix on a Linux system, it uses the existing Linux swap file. On a winduhs 
system, use the command 'mkdosswapfile' (look for 'Knoppix' on the KDE menu) 
to make a nice swap file. It will create a file called knoppix.swp, just 
delete it when you're done.

Dear All:

I was looking for the AverMedia Stereo TV card (uses Brooktree bt878 
chipset)
for my linux box.   I was told that card has some success with watching TV 
and PVR
on linux.

I went to Fry's, but only found AverMedia Ultra TV PCI 300.
Does anyone has any experience with this card on Linux?  Is that
also using the bt878 chipset as well?

Thanks

Message-ID: <BAY9-F41fTvOSQeSOzN0002387d@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

I am looking to upgrade my graphics card for my RH9 box.  I wanted
to purchase the Asus V9180 family which uses Geforce4 MX440-8x as GPU.
I went to Fry's but did not find any ASUS at all.

I found two that looks pretty interesting to me:

  -- PNY Technologies GeForce FX 5200AGP 128MB DDR (s-Video out)

  -- Best Data GeForce4 MX 440-8X

Does anyone has any experience with either one of these 2 cards?
Since drivers are still from Nvidia if I am using a card with GeForce stuff,
I am thinking that the brand of the card is not going to make any
difference.

Any tips/pointers much appreciated.

It's just initializing an associateive array called %hash:

  $hash{'Send 1'} == "Reply 1"
  $hash{'Send 2'} == "Reply 2"

See the perldata(1) man page (or try "perldoc perldata"); you'll get
a longish document about perl data types. If you want to print it for
off-line reading, which I recommend since it takes a while to wrap
your head around its contents, try "man -t perldata | lpr".

Yes.

>From perldata(1):

   It is often more readable to use the "=>" operator between
   key/value pairs.  The "=>" operator is mostly just a more visually
   distinctive synonym for a comma, but it also arranges for its
   left-hand operand to be interpreted as a string--if it's a bareword
   that would be a legal identifier. [...]

Knoppix' speed is directly dependant on the speed of the CD-ROM
drive.  If that's slow, Knoppix will crawl.

at compile-time
  declare $client as a lexically local variable
at run-time
  assign to $client the value returned by the builtin operator 'shift'
    which returns the first element of @_
    and removes it from @_

@_ is the array of arguments passed to the function,
  which are passed by value
and @_ is a dynamically local variable
so modifying @_ like that will not change anything in the caller
except
  if the caller uses a "& foo" style function call without ()
  then the callee gets the same @_ as the caller,
  so modifying @_ also modifies the caller's @_

'shift' will use @ARGV instead of @_
  if it's used lexically outside a function or format
  or within an 'eval $string' statement
    (but not an 'eval {block}' statement)
  or within the special forms BEGIN, INIT, CHECK, END.

Well I got a service disabled because it loops error.  I found out if I
use backtick execution as opposed to the exec trick in a perl script
that I can avoid having the program exit.  I came up with a crude way
to make a daemon.  I start the script with nohup scriptname.pl & and
writing the script so that the last thing it will do instead of exiting
is execute itself again.  I had an exit() statement at first, but xinetd
didn't seem to be satisfied with that.  This Net::EasyTCP package is
really nice.  Guess I'm going to have to figure out how to limit the
allowed source ip to be the web server posting the data as a client.

It was a 52X.

The other thing I noticed was that XFree86 seemed (from "top") to be

It sounds like you ant users to be able to get their spam. If that's
right, why not just let spamassassin mark the header, turn it into an
attachment and let it deliver? Users can usually get that it's spam from
the subject after sa gets done with it, and make appropriate rules,
checking their own spam folder on whatever client they love (or hate)

I use that as a solution for those that are afraid that their spam will
be "something good" that they want. It doesn't take long for them to
forget about the spam folder and let it overrun their system, but, like,
dude, that's what some of them want...

Maybe I missed the point, if so, please disregard.

Indeed I do. 

I have the avermedia TVPhone98 and a hauppage crap tv card and both use
the bt878 chipset. The avermedia is the one I run my primary PVR with.
the hauppage is a 'backup' of sorts. Both cards work fine and were cheap
(like in the <$70 range).

If you are really serious about running a pvr, and have decent linux
knowledge, I would really recommend the hauppage PVR-250 for $150, if
for no other reason than the onboard mpeg2 encoding/decoding. This will
save a bunch of cpu. Currently my athlon 1400 hits barriers while
recording a show and watching a recording. With a pvr-250, cpu load
would fall to almost nothing. 

YMMV, of course, depending on what you're doing and what software you're
using.

hope that helps, 
sasha

Yeah.  Not the answer I was hoping for.  I guess I was hoping for a
"back end" sort of solution, but it sounds as if letting the users sort
by the headers is the best solution.

It's doing that right now.  It's being written to an MBOX-format file
called $HOME/mail/caughtmail

Just for kicks, I installed Evo 1.4 (such things are trivial for a Debian
user on a fast connection ;) and found that at least for me, it defaulted
to MBOX format for its folders.  Unfortunately, it doesn't directly
support creating a folder that links to something in ~/mail, but I was
able to do it by hand.

What I did was:
1. Create a folder in Evolution.  Any name you like (I'm using CaughtSpam
   for this example), create it under Local Folders or as a subfolder.
   (I tried both.)
2. Right-click on the folder, hit Properties... and make sure it says that
   the Current store format is "mbox".  If not, choose "mbox (Local
   delivery)" for New store format.  I left "Index body contents" checked.
3. Exit Evolution.  I don't know if it's necessary, but it's what I did.
4. Go to a shell.
5a. If the folder is directly under Local Folders, type:
 ln -fs ~/mail/caughtspam ~/evolution/local/CaughtSpam/mbox
5b. If the folder is a subfolder under, say, Inbox, type:
 ln -fs ~/mail/caughtspam ~/evolution/local/Inbox/subfolders/CaughtSpam/mbox
6. Start Evolution and marvel at your magical mail folder.  It seems to
   pick up changes when I click to another folder, but I don't know how
   typical this is of Evo.

WARNING:  Just for kicks, I tried seeing what happens when I tell Evo to
delete the folder.  I figured it'd delete the symlink and leave the
original mail folder alone.  Well, quite rudely, it truncates the
mail folder to a zero-length file before deleting the link to it.

Being the sort of idiot who runs destructive tests without backups, I
lost two mailboxes.  Not ones I care about, mind.

Header flags.  Let the users choose what to filter, and provide directions
for Evo, Outbreak, Eudora and Procmail.  They can even choose what
spam-score to filter at.  I've been tempted to start filtering spam into
separate "probably" and "definitely" folders so I can check the former and
trash the latter in good conscience.

IMAP is also a way to go about having server-side filtering, assuming you
have a good IMAP server and email client.

Subject: [PLUG] Red Hat routing follies
Message-ID: <200310261921.35767.carla@bratgrrl.com>

I have two NICs installed in one of my test boxes. Currently I'm messing 
around with Red Hat 9. The NICs are common DLink and Linksys, all duly 
recognized & drivers installed at installation. I'm using only one of them, 
the box connects to a gateway/firewall/switch unit. The IP of the gateway is 
192.168.1.1

The weird part is I can't figure out how Red Hat determines which one to use. 
They are configured the same:

eth0
DEVICE=eth0
ONBOOT=yes
BROADCAST=192.168.1.255
IPADDR=192.168.1.6
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1

eth1
DEVICE=eth1
ONBOOT=yes
BROADCAST=192.168.1.255
IPADDR=192.168.1.8
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1

 The first time I booted it up, I had eth1 connected. But I couldn't get a 
network connection until I moved the cable to eth0. Now RH has decided it 
will use eth1.  How?

This looks weird too:

% /sbin/route

Destination	Gateway	Genmask		Flags	Metric	Ref	Use	Iface
192.168.1.0		*	255.255.255.0	U		0		0	0	eth1
192.168.1.0		*	255.255.255.0	U		0		0	0	eth1
169.254.0.0		*	255.255.0.0	U		0		0	0	eth1
127.0.0.0			*	255.0.0.0		U		0		0	0	lo
default				192.168.1.1	UG		0		0	0	eth1

Wut the heck is going on here? How did eth1 get all the goodies? where did 
169.254.0.0 come from?

It uses both.  Set "ONBOOT=no" on any you're not using.

Oy.  That sort of eenie-miney-moe stuff is not something I've been able to
explain, but static-IP ports come up whether there's a network there or
not.  Since they're both static, it brings up and routes both of 'em.

They both route to the same network, and eth1 was the last one to come up,
I 'spect.  So it did the obvious [sic] thing and used the wrong one.

Your internet router, most likely.

Just to be sure, is there any possibility that there's any DHCP signal getting 
into your subnet? Maybe it's a "feature" from win, you know the one where it 
shuffles all resources until win can't boot.

For this reason, I really like to use two different nics for this. I don't know 
if it's a RH thing, but it's just easier to use different brands. I've been happy 
with generic realtek 8139 cards for the secondary.

Message-ID: <20031027045126.88790.qmail@web9603.mail.yahoo.com>

I think it's a good idea to have two installations of
Linux on one's system, in case one needs to be worked
on while it's not active. Hard drives tend to be huge
these days, so space is not a problem. One of my
distributions is Mandrake. In fact, it's the download
version of 9.0.

I have tried to install SANE and Gnomemeeting RPM's on
this installation, but without success. There are
unsatisfied dependencies.

I'm thinking about getting the retail version of 9.2,
which is about ready to ship. Perhaps it would have
the needed files, and thereby save a lot of time. Does
anyone have comments on this?

My dear Mr. De La Mater, there are no windoze boxes on this particular 
network. Hmph. 

It looks like this:

dsl modem -> firewall/gateway -> 4-port switch -> nice dependable Linux boxen

There is a DHCP server on the gateway box, but that 169.254.0.0 aint even 
close! I suspect that is a Red hat oddity, as none of the Debian boxes ever 
display such mysteries. Or I've been 0wnZored, who knows. :)

This part seems easy enough.  I've run into this problem when I went from
a kernel using modules to a kernel with compiled-in drivers for my NICs.
I believe the answer lies in which module loads first.  First to load
becomes eth0.  You can force this with boot parameters that set the proper
interfaces to the right modules.

Well, 169.254.0.0/16 is a reserved dynamic address range. See RFC3330.
<URL: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3330.html >
Surely some configuration somewhere is forcing the route.  Maybe it's in a
startup script and maybe it's in a DHCP server configuration.

As for how everything got assigned eth1, I don't know.  Double-check your
configurations.

Really, I think Red Hat's init scripts are needlessly circular and cause
this sort of problem quite frequently.

Oh, and I forget that you're not going to read this because you are afraid
of my email.

For me /etc/modules.conf usually has an explanation for module to eth

This is due to Red Hat implementing zeroconf. Caught me by surprise too.

Well, it just ain't natural to run two interfaces on the same network. 
My guess is that it is a race condition for the default route.  Which
ever one wins the race gets to keep the route, sorta thing.  You should
be able to fix it with a "route add" command. Something like

route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.1 dev eth0

should force things to go the way you want them to.

I think this is the address space that Winblows boxes use if they can't
find a DHCP server.  RedHat must be making it easier to find them.

If you set one of your cards to have no gateway, the other will always
do the routing for you.

There's no real master plan here, I just felt like configuring both cards the 
same, except for the IPs.  I was taught to never ever do that, so I did. It's 
my own invention, I call it "Perverse System Administration."

/etc/modules.conf says

alias eth0 8139too
alias eth1 tulip

I assumed that modules were loaded in PCI bus order, but I don't know for 
sure. In this instance they are.

I too have a perverse streak.  But all too often, things blow up in my 
face.  Since, I've learned to equate "perverse" to "masochistic".

I agree with the "PCI bus order" bit.  I would assume 8139too is Dlink and 
tulip is Linksys.  With respect to configuring both interfaces, I've done 
the same and has caused no end of problems down the road with other issues 
and not just routing tables.  Notably firewall rules.  I've learned to 
set ONBOOT to "no" if I don't explicitly need the interface.

I believe this can be turned off.  I think in /etc/sysconfig/network  with 
a "ZEROCONF=no" in it.

My apologies, I had not intended, in any way, to imply that you had
switched over to the dark side. You must admit, though, that the
solution looks amazingly like a DHCP service...

Thanks for all of the Libranet posts, by the way. It installs very
easily, has Karl's favorite app, and runs extremely well on an old
Pentium I had kicking around. It'll be my next firewall, I expect.

My spamassassin was eventually trained to catch almost all those MS
swen virus emails.  You need to train the bayesian filter.
Unfortunately, it won't even kick in until you've trained it with 500
good emails and 500 bad emails.  Look for "sa-learn" in the docs.

I avoid ambiguity by using multi-port Ethernet cards. I just built
a router/firewall that needed 5 interfaces. I used two 2-port
Intel cards and the motherboard-mounted interface. All use the
same Intel chip and the same driver. It always boots predictably.

When using different cards that require different drivers, I
compile the drivers into the kernel for better predictability.

So, overall has plug-and-play been a blessing or a curse?

You should start using the iproute2 stuff instead of the classic
ifconfig and route commands - especially when you're assigning
interfaces addresses from the same block.

That's already been answered. Be aware that link local operation
is still being discussed by the IETF working group. Red Hat's
current implementation may not be the way we do it in the future.

Many of us here try to avoid dependency hell by using

I have a machine with 3 nics. The boot order only matters if you have them
compiled into the kernel (but then there are kernel parameters to force
the order), otherwise the one which is eth0 in modules.conf is eth0, and
so on. However, in addition to specifying GATEWAY you also specify
GATEWAYDEV=eth0 and this determines where the default route goes. Note
that the only thing this determines is the default route, of which you can
only have one. And, of course, you alsways get subnets routed throug their
respective interfaces (unless both are on the same subnet, then it's a
mess and you have to route by hand). After this, if you want to add some
other routes, you must do it explicitly.

Spamassassin only tags spam, doesn't filter it.  That's for you to use
procmail (or your favorite mail delivery agent) to sort that out for
you based on the tag.  Do not direct spam to /dev/null, direct it to a
box to check later to make sure there aren't false positives, and to
report via spamcop.net or manually to the responsible webhosts and
mail hosts.

If you don't mind viruses intermingled with spam in your spamcapture
mailbox, adjust the score for Microsoft executables in your
${HOME}/.spamassassin/user_prefs file to be high enough that spamassassin
will always mark it as spam:

  score MICROSOFT_EXECUTABLE    5.0

Alternatively, you can just have procmail trigger on the specific test.
Here's what I added to my procmailrc during the Sobig outbreak:

  # Ugh, I'm gonna try to keep viruses out of my spam folder...
  :0:
  * ^X-Spam-Status:.*$?.*tests=.*$?.*MICROSOFT_EXECUTABLE
  | gzip >> viruses.gz

That rule has worked quite well for me even though a couple of mailing
lists I moderate were getting hammered by sobig and later swen. The only
downside is neither rule catches virus messages where some "helpful"
anti-virus software along the way filtered out the virus binary, but still
passes along the bogus message.

I made a spam-mailbox to put spam that didn't get caught. Then, I have
the following script that runs weekly, from cron:

#!/bin/sh


#Set Date
set $(date)
DOW="$1"
YEAR="$6"
MON="$2"
DOM="$3"


sa-learn --spam --mbox /home/russj/Mail/spamscan

mv /home/russj/Mail/spamscan /home/russj/.scannedspam/spamscan.$2_$3_$1

touch /home/russj/Mail/spamscan

--8<-- cut here

Make sure to also enable the auto-learn feature in your spamassassin
config file, ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs.

I suppose I should have it check to see if the spam file is larger than zero
bytes, so it only runs if I've actually added spam. Should be a simple
if statment to wrap most of the script. 

I also have a ham scan file to move false positives to. I do that one
manually, since I get very few false positives. Although... It wouldnt'
be hard to make it the same script, and just pass the type (ham|spam)
and mailbox to the script... 

Sorry.. thinking outloud.

Yes, indeedy, Michael is correct on all counts. To be most effective,
Spamassassin needs its Bayes filter to be trained with good *and* bad.

As far as training the "bad", I have an archive of over 12,000 messages
of spam I've received from the past two years, if anybody wants. ;-)

I'm not sure this will help. Mandrake has been pretty good with scanners since 
version 8. Are you using urpmi? That's usually pretty good at resolving 
dependencies, lots better than RPM.

I use mencoder exclusively to encode video into MPEG4.  It does a very
good job as far as I'm concerned... it's sped up a bit, too, with the
1.0 pre-releases.

mencoder comes with mplayer, usually.  It isn't terribly easy to figure
out from the getgo, but if you google about, looking for examples, it
starts to actually make a little bit of sense.

Yes, but SANE has supported my CanoScan 670U only in
its latest release. Not long ago SANE's scanner
information listed this scanner as unsupported.

I'll find out what it is. If it requires the
distribution disks to be inserted, as Caldera formerly
did with its dependency-resolving program, it may not
allow downloaders to get away without buying the
Powerpack.

Don't mind me, I'm just letting my thoughts wander.

While I agree with the needing to train, but I wonder about the use of
holding onto so many emails.  I'm just using Mozilla with it's bayes
filters, but it's only taken me a week or so to get mine trained well
enough to catch 95% of Spam with no falses.  Then again with 12,000
emails, you get it trained right off the bat.

Shouldn't there be a way of distributing the training?  After all the
filters are not holding onto 12000 bits of data.

Message-ID: <20031027175036.GA3854@blain.org>

How do I setup networking on a System V/88 Unix system running on a Motorola Series 900?

Here is a pic of a similar box to what I have.

www.openbsd.org/images/mvme187-4.jpg

There are 2 ethernet connections on the back. One is standard rj-45 the other AUI. I have run ifconfig -a and it returns nothing at all, net even lo0. I also can't ping 127.0.0.1 so it doesn't even seem that networking is even running at all.

I have also ran through the sysadm menu. I was kind of confused on it, But I went through and messed with basic network setting... rebooted, but still no network.

If anyone has a clue bat, please throw it at me.

Also, when I plug the ethernet onto a switch, the switch light shows a connection, as well as the ethernet light on the front of the motorola light up.

There appears to be some kind of Web setup for
Mandrake's RPM dependency resolver, presumably the
equivalent of apt-get

http://plf.zarb.org/~nanardon/

This kind of issue might be a good thing to discuss.
Debian is supposed to be difficult to install, whereas
Mandrake is easy to install. (Note Joseph Cheek's
comments on the installation of Debian! He said he had
to settle for 640 x 480.) Nevertheless, if updates are
a lot easier with Debian, it makes the choice less
obvious than it would otherwise be.

Well, no, you need a large corpus of ham as well as spam to get it
completely trained. Yes, perhaps only 500 or so are necessary. See below
for more thoughts on this.

FWIW -- Amongst all those and the, oh I dunno, ~2000 real messages
I've received, I've received all of 3 false positives. And those
weren't even really that critical. Of the 30-50 spam I get each day
now, I get 0-2 false negatives a day, for which I have a learn/
spamcop/file script.

But, no, there's no sane reason for holding on to all of them. I've just
got the disk space, and I want to sit down and do text analysis on them
some day and figure out how big my penis would be by now, and how rich
I'd be in Nigerian dollars. :-)

Next year, I'll be discarding and tallying extremely highly rated spam,
rather than just keeping it. This will be for statistical purposes. Of
note: last year was 2000; this year is 10,000 and on track for about
12,000 or so. Which means that this year, I will have received SIX TIMES
as much spam. I wonders what 2004 holds in store for me.

I'm not sure how the various databases work, but my impression with
spamassassin at least is that ham and spam are all weaved into the same
hash. Which is bad for just sharing them, because your ham is not my ham.

I think I used one of those things back in '95 though we were migrating at

That means that the HW is probably working.  If you can't get it up and
going, I'd be willing to swing by for a late afternoon or early evening
frustration of fiddling.  I'm pretty sure it's feasible to get going and
it's probably going to come down to a few things:
1. The proper drivers aren't there.
2. Something hasn't been started.
3. It's probably somewhere in a manual.

This may help... You can download the email archives from the URL above
and use formail to run the archived spams through your system. This will
train the system in about an hour of processing time depending on the
number of emails you send through.

That would be nice, but I can't find any trace of "MICROSOFT_EXECUTABLE"
in the spamassassin config files, or the SPAM tags of the offending
messages.

Rescue mode on your distro CD is one such installation.  So there ya go.

That's common.  So you install the dependencies' RPMs, too.

Doesn't Mandrake have a nice tool that takes care of that stuff for you?

Won't help, 9.2 does things the same way as 9.0.

If the RPMs exist, their dependency RPMs should, too.  Those RPMs are
often hard to find, since when installing SANE, say, it'll ask for things
like "libfratzle09" and and "glub4_zug", which you may not know are both
supplied by FesterBesterTester-v2_04.23a-01.rpm

So, two ways to go about this:
a. Note what dependencies it's asking for, search for them on
http://rpmfind.net and then hand-install their RPMs (from your CDs) before
you install SANE etc. or
b. Use Mandrake's tools for this, urpmi or rpmdrake.


And yes, as a snake-handling full-gospel Debianist, I think "use Debian"
or "use apt-get" are Right answers, but they're about as useful as telling
some poor heathen with a bad rattlesnake bite that if they get on the
Righteous Path, they won't get bit again.  ;)

I don't think it has been networked before. I was told that it did have a T1 connected to it but that it went through the digi-board, and not through the ethernet port.

This was my thought, that something needs to be kicked in for it to work.

Sigh... The one book I don't have is TCP/IP Administration. The rest of the manuals I have tell me how to change IP's, and that about it. Nothing about getting networking going in general.

Is there a way to connect a program like minicom, to connect through to the console port? I have a rj-45 to serial patch cord that I made awhile back. I am trying to grab a database off the old box to be put on another, but the tape drives are dead so I'm trying to find another way in.

Thanks,

Jeff

You can configure sources for urpmi. I have mine set up to download

How are you dynamically creating the text? You could conceivably create the
tags dynamically as well, if it's like a PERL or PHP script.

Right...  I do dynamically create the tags.  But I need to be able to set
the value="something something highlight this something something" within
the input tag.

I'm not that hip to spamassassin development, but it's there in
2.60 and was also present in 2.53. In 2.60, the tests show up in
/usr/share/spamassassin/20_body_tests.cf (your location may vary).

I dunno if more modern versions of spamassassin have done away with
that check -- if so, I'll be very unhappy. But a cursory examination of
http://useast.spamassassin.org/tests.html shows that it's still claimed
to be present.

Subject: [PLUG] Cleaning a DI30 drive without the cleaning tape...
Message-ID: <1067281937.18966.32.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I can find people selling data tapes for the drive, but nobody sells 
a cleaning tape where google pops up one obscure warehouse somewhere
that is selling a cleaning tape for who knows which drive made
by Onstream costing darn near $40.

Is there any possibility of cleaning the DI30 with alcohol and 
q-tips?  Maybe I can take a data tape that doesn't work and 
convert it to a cleaning tape by shaping some material to the 
same dimensions as the media, impregnating that with the right 
cleaning chemical, then respooling with the custom made
cleaning ribbon.  These tapes are very easy to open.  The other 
idea I have is scotch taping the media in a cartridge and 
spreading a light layer of alcohol on the tape, but I 
probably run the risk of jamming the drive if I try that.
I don't even know if alcohol is safe to use to try and 
clean the heads inside.  If the heads aren't dirty, their
broken.  

I've looked at getting a drive that's know to be good
for the four to seven working tapes I have, but I haven't 
seen one worth paying for where the ones on E-Bay can't be 
trusted since this is where I got this one.  Even if I got 
a clean one, how long could I go without a cleaning tape?

I'm assuming that tar and taper crash with an io error that they
can't read the tape because the heads are dirty, the drive is
Linux certified.  I would think I could try the drive under
Windows, thing is that I doubt even if Windows did work that 
it would necessarily check the integrity of what was written 
to the tape failing to rule out dirty heads.

If anyone knows how to get a cleaning tape that will work for cheap
instead of trying to make one or pay $40 for potentially the wrong 
one, that'd be great.

If anyone wonders why I'm not going with Keith's idea, it's because 
I'm not USB2 ready.  I have Inclose and Data Bridge drive trays,
but they are the ide type which Linux currently doesn't support hot
swap for.

While I'm on the topic, this drive royally stinks where I have five 
new tapes and two new ones that are probably good, anyone know how 
to liquidate this stuff online?  If I can get $15 a tape for the 
new ones that'd be reasonable giving me nearly enough to buy a 
hard drive.  I've tried some of the new tapes in this drive, but
I think the tapes are fine.  I have gotten some data to be written
to and restored from a tape as far as what md5sum checking can tell 
me.

As I posted on this very list a few weeks ago, here are some good deb
sources for woody backports of newer Spamassassin packages:
(Add this to /etc/apt/sources.list)

# Sources for spamassassin backports
deb ftp://debian.marlow.dk/ woody virus
deb-src ftp://debian.marlow.dk/ woody virus

Enjoy.

This makes no sense to me.

If Spamassassin already caught the stuff as spam, why pipe it through
sa-learn?  And if you're piping it through sa-learn manually (via cron),
why are you using auto-learn?

I only use sa-learn on spam that got through without getting filtered.

It seems that if it's already been flagged and already gone through
auto-learn you shouldn't have to pass it through manually as well.

don't think so.  well, maybe IE has an extension for that, but
standard input widgets have limited display capability.  if you
don't need it to be user-editable, use a <span> or <div>

RS232->RJ45 pinouts are different for each piece of hardware.  Make sure
you have the right pinout.  A $10 set of RS232 test lights can be very,
very useful here.  As can some extra RJ45-DB25 adapters.

There are worse ways than taking 2 days dumping a 1MB database to console
or serial printer, capturing it on a PC, massaging it into shape and
importing it into the new database.  F'r instance, taking 2 days to get
Ethernet working, or 10 days to retype from printouts...

Also, CPAN is your friend. I find that cpan installs most perl modules
and their dependencies with little trouble. 

The only time I've found that to not be the case is when a particular
module needs the source to some program. e.g. the DBD::mySQL module.

I can't read Portuguese either but whoever made that site needs to take
a web designing course or something.  Even if I could read the language
I couldn't read it because of the annoying background.  Quite an ugly

Actually, it's better to use spamassassin -r or spamassassin -k for
flagging as spam or ham, this also updates razor and pyzor along with
teaching your bayesian learner.

That also works, but it'll be slower to learn that way.

No, you don't, if it has flagged it as auto-learned.  You're correct

Close...

sleep has the script pause for a determined amount of time.  PAUSE, in
DOS, sits there until the user hits the Enter key to continue with the
batch file.

As somebody else said, read is probably what they're looking for.

Every time I quit using a Linux something for a few months, it might as well 
be years. Of living in a cave. So after concentrating on Debian for the past 
few months, I download a shiny new Red Hat 9 to play with. Whilst messing 
with some SRPMS, I tried my olde familiar rpm -rebuild command. Well was that 
ever a luser move, it gave me an error message.

WTF, I says, scratching myself. So after a bit of searching I find that the 
correct command is rpmbuild --rebuild.

Now tell me. Just how long has this rpmbuild command been floating around?
And am I the only one who didn't notice it sneaking up?

Red Hat 8.0 was the first I saw it. I think they decided the rpm utility was
just getting too big. So they split the developer functions in to rpmbuild and
left the system admin functions in rpm.

Since the turn of the century, apparently.  The functionality was removed
from RPM but aliased in /etc/popt, at least until RH9.  Read here:

> And am I the only one who didn't notice it sneaking up?

Nope.  I had the same experience when porting some custom RPMs to RH9.
Burned my crumpets, it did.  Forgot about it 'til you asked.

That was my point. I send messages it MISSED (i.e. false negatives) to

You can clean the heads of the drive with alcohol and q-tips. Do not ever use 
alcohol on any rubber in any drive (VCR, DAT...) There's special cleaner for the 
rubber or you can use an abrasive like your VCR tape for the rubber. Alcohol 
pulls the oil out of the rubber and kills it. (thet's the technical term for it)

That's my 2 cents, anyway.

What's so hard about dns and dhcp?  Instead of a 
strange subset of features for ip which is already 
getting downright strange I should say, why doesn't 
the IETF simply comsider making the configuration
of DNS and dhcp easier?  Couldn't one just use host 
files?  How in a simple network is it easier to use
an imperfect plug and pray system over statically 
assigning a couple of addresses?  I'm not buying 
the argument that it's that expensive to have 
anything under non IP protocols regardless of the 
networking need either.  

The biggest problem with Windows PC's and MAC OS 
systems is the rebooting issue when any network 
setting is changed.  What the IETF should do is 
not make ip do everything, what they should do 
is develop a universal higher layer networking 
API, if anything.  In my opinion, our lans 
should use their own and frankly more 
straightforward, more efficient, and simpler 
protocols than ip.  For firewalling purposes,
it's safer to use a different protocol on a 
lan than ip.

It seems sad to me that there is movement forward 
on dynamic dns and now making ip work in a way that 
will make autonetworking the norm in the absence of 
a proper configuration, yet the integrity of dns by 
adding cryptography to the name services protocols 
is as of yet not realized and other security concerns, 
that should be raised by any computer being able to 
become a server, are not addressed adequately with 
the zeroconf work.  Zeroconf isn't necessary and in 
my opinion is a headache.  Zero thought networking 
where no firewalling is considered is a really bad 
idea.
 
There's another point that confounds me, why hasn't
dns been redesigned so that there is a domain
name reversed for lans, .pri or something?
For this to work, future name servers would know 
not to look outside the private ranges of ip 
addresses to resolve addresses that end in 
.pri.  Putting everything on the Internet network 
wastes address space even if we all go to IPv6.

from the zeroconf web page:
    ... making it possible to take two laptop computers, and
    connect them with a crossover Ethernet cable, and have them
    communicate usefully using IP, without needing a man in a
    white lab coat to set it all up for you. We're not limiting
    the network to just two hosts, but we want to take that as
    the starting point.
to do that with dhcp, you have to configure a dhcp server on one
laptop or the other.  dhcp servers are difficult to
autoconfigure.  and you have to make sure you're not running more
than one dhcp server.

you run into more problems if you try to plug in something else.
if six guys at the airport want to have an ad-hoc lan game, the
one with the dhcp server can't leave early without screwing up
the lan.

I'm sure you can come up with other problems if you think about
it for a while.

With move of Redhat Linux to Fedora Linux I've decided to look at other 
distribution options.  One of my biggest complaints with RHL is the 
irrelevant (to me) dependencies too often imposed on packages.  My best 
example is why are Japanese fonts part of the standard installation and 
impossible to 'not install'?

So I'm looking at LFS.  This appears to be just what the doctor ordered 
for me.  I've reviewed the other distributions and may go to one of them 
if LFS is too much of a hassle to deal with.

So my question is; has anyone tried and/or succeeded with a LFS install?  
I'm looking at servers and desktops so any and all input is appreciated.

Actually, this has not been an issue since Win2k shipped. 

The only time you need to reboot is when joining or leaving a
domain/workgroup. You can change IP, disable/enable networking, etc.
without rebooting in W2K, XP and W2K3.

I believe the dhcp server could leave without incident, unless one of
the machines tries to get a new IP. 

Once the NIC has an address, it pretty much ignores the DHCP server
until it needs to renew the lease. 

The DNS server, on the other hand, is something that couldn't leave,
unless other arrangements are made for name resolution. e.g. /etc/hosts
file.

Never tried LFS.  I would suggest you also take a look at Gentoo; it's 
portage system is quite nice.

It sounds like your complaint is more with the package management. You
might want to try a different distro but I wouldn't recommend LFS. When
you start installing a bunch of different apps it will be hell getting
the different required libraries and other programs together.

Try giving Debian a shjot. If you really like customizing stuff then try
Gentoo. You could also try one of the BSDs.

You'll run in to issues like that with any binary-based distro.  FWIW,
Slackware doesn't track dependencies, so you don't get nearly as locked
in as with RPM or Apt.

I did LFS once, before I found Gentoo.  I used Debian as a bootstrap and
was compiling everything inside VMWare at the time, on a Duron 650.

It was agonizingly slow, but that's to be expected with a setup like I
had.  :-)

One significant problem with doing LFS, especially if you're looking at
it for a server, is there isn't anybody out there to track program
updates, like security updates, for you, accross the board like there is
if you use a 'regular' distro.  If you're willing to keep track of any
and all applications on your server, keeping an eye out for security
problems, then that won't be an issue... but if you have a life and not
the time to do all that, LFS probably isn't for your servers.

For desktops, I think LFS is great.  The security issue isn't quite as
paramount (when I say desktop, I mean desktop behind a nice firewall),
and the added performance is significant.

I would, if I were you, take a really good look at Gentoo.  With its USE
flags, it does essentially exactly what you're asking for.  There are
still some package management issues that might keep you from doing
exactly what you want, but, IMHO, they are worth the hassle.  I still
prefer Slackware for my servers, though.  It's proven and powerful.

but it becomes awkward to add a new machine to the network.  you
need to transfer all the state from the old dhcp server to a new
dhcp server, or else you have to force all the leases to expire
and request new ones from the new server, which might hand out
different ip addresses, which means any existing network
connections will get broken.

I'll try to ACTUALLY answer your questions here instead of just suggesting
other routes than the one about which you are curious.

Well, I think that's a fairly minimal example.  Being able to properly
represent what a person would like to display is important.  A diverse set
of fonts help you to see things the way authors intend.

But I get what you mean.  I've never understood why Red Hat was so
freakin' huge.

> So my question is; has anyone tried and/or succeeded with a LFS install?

I run a few LFS systems.  There's more regular administration than a
package-based system, but you get more flexibility and an ability to be on
a bleeding edge that binary package management just doesn't allow.  (Also,
you learn HEAPS about the way a system really works.)

You're still going to run into dependency problems and you'll have to
watch every build to see if key features are being quietly (hopefully not
silently, unless it's a really poorly configured build routine) disabled
for lack of a library or something.  You start to build something, realize
you need something else, etc.  You end up working your way backwards down
several trees sometimes.  But a tiny bit of research on the front side can
save you an hour's work on the back.

I'd personally recommend building a system from scratch (LFS or otherwise)
rather than one of the source-based distributions because I prefer to get
the source directly from the maintainer rather than from some third party
that has done unknown futzing.  The LFS Book contains numerous patches
that should (and sometimes must) be applied to the standard source
packages, but they are short, comprehensible and, most importantly,
plainly published for all to see.

> I'm looking at servers and desktops so any and all input is appreciated.

I would choose something with a little less administration overhead for a
server.  Personally, I'd go with Debian.  I think you'll like the
flexibility and control you can get with the apt tools and the larger
software systems are usually spread out among several package with
different levels of dependency (required, recommended, suggested, etc.).

I have one LFS server (on a P60, if you can believe it), but it runs so
few services, I don't have much trouble keeping it updated.

This is true, however, it was not part of the test case presented. :)

Actually, not quite true, if you change from static back to dhcp, you

Message-ID: <20031028180235.GA18342@gate.kl-ic.com>

The Grub bootloader documentation is written for general *nix systems,
with a bias towards BSD.  Are there any Grub documents that are written
specifically for Linux, and have a cookbook approach?  

Right now, specifically, I am looking for how to prepare a "third party"
drive.  I am building a boot drive for target machine A.  I am temporarily
mounting it as the second drive ( /dev/sda ) on workshop machine B.  So
the boot information goes into temporary /dev/sda, points at
/boot/grub/grub.conf on what will be /dev/hda1 on the target machine A,
and grub itself is running on /dev/hde1 on machine B.  I would like to
do this from the command line.

This, BTW, is the last part of a script I am writing to rebuild a drive
from backups.  Then to write a metaprogram to write such scripts.  
Eventually, it will be a single command, ./rebuild , that will rebuild
a boot disk from bare metal and backups.

Not on this XP box I'm forced to work on at work, or on one of the 2000
Pro boxes I have in my testlab. 

I just changed it from static to DHCP, verified with ipconfig that it
did indeed change, surfed, then changed it back without a reboot.

Keith,

  You may want to contact Lincoln Drury of EmperorLinux.com. My new laptop
with Slackware-9.1 is shipping today -- after about a two week delay -- so
they could create a version of grub that works with Slackware. I've had no
problems with LILO, but apparently grub is a much better general solution.
After wrestling with my box they are probably a good source for pointers to
the type of information you need.

  I know that Lincoln explained the differences between lilo and grub to me,
but I haven't retained the information as I don't have a need to know on a
regular basis.

HTH,

function findFormField() {
   var i, f;
   var contents = 'blah';
   for(i=0; (f = document.myForm.getElementsByTagName("input")[i]); i++) {
      if(f.value.indexOf(contents) != -1) {

         f.bgColor="blue";  // This line doesn't work

}

The above code finds the correct input field, except I'm not sure how to
reference the table row that the field is in so I can change the
background color of the entire row.
Any suggestions?

A couple of weeks ago, I installed apt-rpm on around 10 Linux computers
I'm in charge of (at work and at home). So far, it has worked
flawlessly, quickly and easily. The only hitch I found was a lack of a
Red Hat 7.1 rpm... There's a 7.0, 7.2, and 7.3 version, but I can't
find a 7.1. All my other machines are Red Hat 8.0 or 9.

IP networking was designed with permanence in mind.  It's not a
networking protocol that was ever intended for random servers to
be elected out of any group of hosts.  Netware, I believe, doesn't
have addressing problems except for frame type issues.  For this
type of networking where it really is temporary, it makes more
sense to avoid server based protocols instead of butchering
them in my opinion.  In a small network of say six laptops that's
certainly temporary, why use dhcp and dns at all?  Is it that hard 
for people to learn what ip blocks to use where were talking only 
six laptops maybe getting configured?  As long as your not 
Internet connected, it really doesn't matter that much anyways 
assuming you don't try to use the special ip addresses.  You 
don't need name resolution necessarily for video games over 
ip either.  In a netbios over IP setup, the machines 
announce their existence to each other via broadcasting, 
though it's awfully chatty if you connect enough machines.  
For a small enough lan though, not having a central 
nameserver and assigning ip's manually is feasible.  
Only when the Internet is introduced does dns need 
to be used.

Thing is, this reminds me of Microsoft's everything 
plugged into everything mentality regardless of the 
outcome.  I'd prefer a lan game to have it's own 
protocol and not be interoperable with existing ip 
or Novell networking shares.  IP networks often use 
server side security, unplugging yourself from your 
server and hooking into the laptop of some stranger 
at an airport exposing shares that are normally 
only exposed to your hopefully trustworthy server 
is not a safe activity.  This is why gameboy and 
the like are so popular as these don't tend to 
have sensitive data on them.  Perhaps Linux's 
chroot capabilities are very useful here in 
that you could place whatever you need in
that contained jail for your connection to the 
stranger hopefully insulating other stuff on your 
system from harm.

I proprose fixing dhcp so that essentially you indicate
in your dhcp server either that it's authoritative for a 
certain network or that it's a client/backup of another.  
Have it when it's not master cache the leases of the 
master server.  In cases where two dhcp servers claim 
to be the master of the same network, have one turn 
off and the other switch to assigning out of a pool 
of standard non routable private addresses.

People use dynamic addresses a lot with dhcp, I don't.  I 
assign via dhcp, but I don't bother to do address pools.  I
use it to centrally link a mac address to a hostname and
then have dns deliver the ip number.  As long as people
don't try to use numbers instead of the names of their
machines to access them, I could start using dynamic 
addressing with the only trouble being getting the dns
updated.  There are ways to do this now, but I don't
feel that dns is secure enough to be using them yet.




A little off topic, why are ISP's including Opus now filtering
all ping requests from customers to anywhere routed through
their networks?  This seems to be a growing trend.  It's one
thing to say no ping flooding, but to not allow ping at all
just doesn't make sense as it takes away a troubleshooting 
tool commonly used to verify that there is network connectivity

I use apt-rpm for maintaining a Redhat 7.3 and a Redhat 8.0
machine. The one I use is from http://apt.freshrpms.net/. It is of
course great for combatting rpm dependency problems. I have the
feeling that the apt-rpm databases are not as extensive yet as the
Gentoo emerge or Debian apt databases, both of which I also use, but
it is  a big step up from trying to solve the dependency problems by
hand.

  I tried it for a long while -- several months. It never found anything for
me. :-( So I went back to grabbing packages as Red Hat's bugzilla sent me an
e-mail about them.

Well now, isn't that interesting, I know I had to reboot win2k last
night when I changed from static to DHCP.  It went from DHCP to static
without a reboot, though.  I really don't like proprietary OS's, no idea
what is really going on.

This is a difficult enemy to know.

I can read manuals and figure out problems, but I'm not quite sure exactly
what sort of words to use in finding what I seek.  If anyone has
particular suggestions, please let fly.

I'm hoping to set up a floppy-based firewall/router in two locations that
will act as a regular firewall/router for the wide internet and as a VPN
tunnel for connections between the two networks.

Is that sensible to all?

What I'm REALLY looking for is a transparent LAN solution, so non IP
tunnelling across the two locations is desirable.

Don't know if Linux can support this, but it's dirt cheap making 
it a throw out if it doesn't work.  If nothing else, maybe I can 
gut it to fix my internal ide one.  I think the problem may be 
that it's not rolling the tape.  Replacing the roller might be
possible.  What's do you folks think?  This guy says it works

I figured it out...  I had to move two nodes up.  So I changed f.bgColor

Yes.  I think the floppyfw distro has vpnd on it.   If not you can
likely get CIPE, Free/SWAN, or even pppd over sshd to work.

The real trick is the word "transparent."  It is pretty easy to set up a
TCP/IP tunnel between two places.  If LAN A is 192.168.0.X and LAN B is
192.168.1.X, and everyone knows to route.  It is not so easy if you need
things likes CUPS, SMB, and other services that magically discover each
other.  

In that case you can do something like 
        LAN A, 192.168.0.X/25
        LAN B 192.168.0.64/25 
        Proxyarp all IPs for the other LAN on each gatewy
                GW A proxyarp (announces it is) 192.168.0.64/25
                GW B proxyarp (announces it is) 192.168.0.0/25
        All machines are configured 192.168.0.0/24
        
Thus all machines think they are on a 24 bit network.
When they look for the other network, the router says "its me" and sends
the packet over the link.
Then it gets to the machine it belongs.

Problems?  

What if the IP does not exist?  The router sent out an ARP message, so
your workstation times out, instead of no IP, or connection refused.

Better solution:
Have GW B only proxyarp (announce IP arps) for IPs that GW A sees.
Except what if the machine was just turned on, and GW B does not see it?

So we would prefer to BRIDGE ARP requests and responses over the link. 
This can be done.  Now it only problem is latency, but that is workable.

So the best solution is LAN IPs that are different.  This works if
people do not grab the wrong IPs (like move a laptop from one to the
other).  It may require some service masters rebroadcasting services
(CUPS/SMB) but that is often straight forward.

Second best is bridging.  I avoid bridging when I can.  Things get
reliant when there is a bridge there, and when it goes, things break.

You know my first distribution was slackware - circa 1993 - but it was too

   Debian bothers me too much with what appears to be a slow release cycle

So I'm still looking/thinking on it.

Again thanks to all for your input.

Debian hosts three versions, Testing is the middle-ground you may be
looking for (currently called Sarge).

In regards to LFS, I tried BYO Linux (the same idea as LFS) and my
experiences mirrored Jeme's description of LFS.  Building a system
from scratch was a great experience, but I wouldn't choose to do it
again (<disclaimer about there always being exceptions>).

Took me awhile to grokk it after much SysV, but now I'm happy.  I've got
three Gentoo systems happily buzzing away.  My biggest problem has been
getting OpenOffice 1.1 compiled.

You need to look into the "setup" command. It will invoke a number of
lower level commands. Inspect them carefully and reinvoke them with the
appropriate drives. i.e., by default setup assumes you will be install
and booting from the drive you specify and that the filesystem
containing /boot/grub is mounted root (which it never is for me).

Also of note: if you build grub yourself, you can netboot kernels. ;-)

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. grub's extremely
powerful, and I've done quite a bit with it -- I have a superboot
project that I've burned onto CD and used on a USB key with tons of
stuff like memtest and trinux and a dos boot all in one package. I do
have a stripped down floppy-only superboot that I use for recovering
from failed boots which works like a top.

You might try less agressive CFLAGS or possiblily post your error
messages?

I just need to spend a little more time on it. The CFLAGS do need backing
off. I'm using the binary at the moment and once I have a little time,
I'll get a compile working.
Though one error was I didn't have enough space for the compile.  Woo,
that's big.

Many here will disagree with this (and they should if they
think the LSB and FHS are holy) but I find BSD-style to be
much easier when the system runs relatively few daemons, such
as routers, firewalls, DNS servers/caches, etc. I just
delivered a system to a customer in which I built a startup
system that was as simple as possible. The customer wanted to
admin the system from the command line but was intimidated by
the complexity of SysV-style startup. 

So, I put everything in /etc/rc.d - there's no /etc/sysconfig
tree. All parameters that he might normally need to change,
such as IP-related settings, are in a single data file called
config. The script that brings up networking is called net.
The firewall rules are in a script called firewall. Other
scripts are added as needed.

My customer understood system startup in a few minutes and was
delighted at how "simple and clean" (his words) it was. Months
ago, when I tried to explain Red Hat Linux startup to him, his
eyes glazed over. To him, this was a major improvement over
"Linux".

Hee, hee... Hard to solve that one if your hard disk is small :)

One thing I do is use PORTAGE_TMPDIR="/home/tmp" as my home partition is rather big. You can set PORTAGE_TMPDIR in /etc/make.conf or use the export command like so... export PORTAGE_TMPDIR="/otherdir/tmp"

No OpenOffice.Org would be a show stopper for me but I see in another
message from you there is a binary - good.  This makes me realize I need
to get a list of must have applications and see if they install/compile on
whatever I choose - thanks.

IIRC, the OpenOffice ebuild strips cflags *because* it is such a terrible
thing to build.

FWIW, I did build it (well, ever 1.0, I think) once on Gentoo.  I used
Sun's Java, even, and hacked up the ebuild to allow a few cflags through. 
I didn't notice any speedups.

I tried again back in August to build it ... version 1.1-betawhatever back
then, I think.  It compiled happily for ... ohhh... about nine hours
before it finally gave out on me.  Oh, and this was on a P4 1.7GHz system.
 *sigh*

I haven't tried since then.  I just use KOffice instead, printing to PDF
files when I can't print locally so I can print from the school's
computers.  OpenOffice is there, but it isn't being used.

I didn't catch Jeme's original message...

But OpenVPN is capable of tunnelling over SSL using the tap interface.

It's different than most VPN solutions I've seen, but it seems to do the
job nicely for what I need.

ok.  1, see if someone's doing that already.  if not: 2, write a
short description.  3, implement it.  4, make it easy to use,
scalable, and easy to maintain.  5, deploy it.  6, convince other

It's easier for the admin to disallow pings than to monitor for
excessive pings. 

Then, what is "excessive pings"? Who defines it, and what if your
definition is different than the admins?

Um, my experience didn't lead me to not wanting to do it again.  I've done
it several times and consider it one of the three sensible ways to build a
GNU/Linux system (Debian, LFS, floppyfw).

I think you might be right.  I also tried a build outside of portage and
that one failed in a different way.
The Binary installed easily enough, though I did 'setup -net' and was
having a bit of a trouble with the local setups until I got rid of the old
config files.  It also helped to install the sun-sdk instead of
blackdown's java.
Now that it's working, it's working well.  (Oh, the binary ebuild isn't at
1.1 yet though that'll probably change in the next week.)

I probably won't try the actual compile now for a few months.  Waiting 12+
hours for the compile isn't that fun.

Yup.  My ol' favorite infopage is http://linas.org/linux/vpn.html
but it may be outdated.

Linas' page mentions one old product that does bridging (the technical
term for transparent LAN routing) over VPN.  I've also seen mention of a
special 2.2 kernel patch for bridging over Freeswan-VPN.

It's an evil thing to compile.  I, personally, think it is a decent
enough app to use, although it's very slow and bulky-feeling... but it
isn't meant to be compiled by the likes of you and me.

That's odd - they seem to want Blackdown instead of Sun.  I don't have
any idea why, though.  I don't like Java enough to really keep that good
a track of it.

ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge -p openoffice-bin

It's there, it just isn't listed as stable yet, for some reason.

It isn't fun at all.  It's worse than KDE because it seems to bomb out
more frequently.  Oh well.  :-)

Slackware is a whole other beast... I really like it, it's the first
Linux I actually had do what I wanted to do.

Slackware's just Linux.  It isn't like Debian or RedHat with all their
frilly stuff.  You configure stuff by editing config files, not
navigating through some odd GUI-based utility.

If you were thinking about LFS.. give Slackware a shot.

If I were setting up such a thing, a router acting as a VPN bridge, too,
so users at both end can't tell they're being VPN'd, as though they were
plugged in to the same switching hub... I'd go for OpenVPN utilizing the
tap driver set up to do bridging.

It's what I do for my laptop.  When I'm at school, I fire up OpenVPN on
the desktop machine at home (via SSH), add the tap0 interface to the br0
bridge (which already exists), give an IP to tap0 (for whatever reason,
it seems to need an IP whereas a physical interface doesn't), and away I
go, packets flying.

I don't have to do any special configuration on the laptop's side of
things except to assign tap0 an IP address and run openvpn.

I don't remember ever using a GUI-based utility to configure stuff in

Good question.  Maybe things have changed.

When I ran RH myself (way back around the 6.2 days) linuxconf seemed to
overwrite everything I edited by hand.

Fast forward to today, I was fixing a friend's RH 8.0 box for him and
edited some files manually.  He later launched the GUI utility for
whatever it was (Apache, I think), and it promtply overwrote the changes
I had made to the file to match up with what it thought should be there.

rpm -e linuxconf. As for the GUIs - again do not use them - it's that
simple. I believe in RH9 there is a separate RPM(s) with the GUI-conf
stuff rpm -e GUI-conf-stuff and there - worry free.

This is a chronic problem with Red Hat and Mandrake, and probably other 
distributions too. Their GUI configs are not front-ends for the text config 
files, but interact with the system in their own weird way. In my excellent 
opinion, this is way lame.

I apologize for replying to myself, but... 
Have you made any changes to apache? 
have you checked /var/log/messages or 
/var/log/httpd/error_log (if you run RatHed)

does netstat -nat show anything listening on port 80?

I actually ran in to just that problem when I was working on a friend's
RH 8.0 box (mentioned in another thread, BTW)...

After googling about for about ten minutes, it became apparent the
easiest way to fix this problem was the microsoft way - Reboot.

Have you tried rebooting?

Has anyone tried vtun?  It claims to be the easiest way to create a
large variety of "virtual tunnels" using TCP/IP or UDP.  From their
website:

"IP tunnel (tun).
	Supports point-to-point IP tunnel.  

Ethernet tunnel (ether).
	Supports all protocols that work over Ethernet:
IP,IPX,Appletalk,Bridge,...  

Serial tunnel (tty).
	Supports all protocols that work over serial lines:PPP,SLIP,...  

Pipe tunnel (pipe).
	Supports all programs that works over Unix pipes."

But I haven't had a chance to test it out, yet.

I believe I had this same problem the other day.  There was some kind of kernel lock on apache's "scoreboard file".  Which can happen after restarting apache too many times.  The easiest fix is to comment the line in your httpd.conf that reads:

ScoreBoardFile conf/httpd.scoreboard

I'm not sure, but I read that file just isn't very important.

I've had to build a few boxes that basically required "from scratch"
builds of the major parts of the system.  You know, the whatchamacallit
that has to be custom compiled to connect to the doohickey, which has to
be custom compiled and patched so that the thingamabob can be called up
by the client's proprietary interface. 

Debian is a great place to start from.  The basic policies are followed
by most programmers, and the policy of NEVER stomping on a config file
without permission is a real godsend (I think to make it into stable,
this policy must be followed).  A basic Debian system will compile most
things that claim to have been compiled on some sort of linux box,
usually without any problem.  If there are problems, dselect will
usually find all of the dependent libraries.  After the compile, I can
put the config files (or sym links) in the usual Debian places (so I can
find them later) and not worry that they will be stomped on by another
program.

With a little tweaking, you can burn it into an ISO9660 file system and
boot it from your CD-ROM, this can make for a very full featured
firewall/router (Gibraltar).  With a little more tweaking, you can
compress it into an ISO9660 file system and boot an entire desktop
environment from your CD_ROM, some folks in Germany have done a great
job of that (Knoppix).

I guess my point is, the Debian distribution is very flexible and is
worth the effort of learning to install.

To run or not to run internet news, that is an interesting question.
It's billed as a way to ease pressure on software authors who'd like 
to answer a question once.  From the short description on the ISC
website though it looks worse than email.  Is a news server what you

Try to write a GUI that can read the linux conf files and then write
back to them.

When you are done, let me edit the conf files for 5 minutes(*).  I bet
you your app will not work (i.e. the conf file will be wrong).

Bastille, Linuxconf, Webmin, (RH|Mandrake|Debian) config, etc. all have
to make the config files fit their needs in order to be sure it works.
On the other hand most of my config files are filled with commented
aborted attempts to get things to work.

Until there is some form of standardization on conf files, and a rigid
format to them, this will allows be a problem.  Even ini files have more
structure than most /etc/sysconfig files.  Probably the way to go is an
XML file, since each entry would have meta information about it, thus
apps could "upgrade" their understanding about the files.

Now I LOVE GUI config programs.  Why?  For *other* people.  I feel like
an idiot that I do not know how to add modems, or ISPs, or alternative
numbers to friend's/client's/my system without editing 4 or 5 files (or
running pppd from a terminal windows).  Make Linux sound oh so powerful
when I say "Of course you can dial to earthlink, all you need to do is
type "vi ......"  Even windows 98 has the pattern down fairly well.

Or USB/Flash drives.  Windows will just add a letter, and away you go. 
Linux, you have to jump through some hoops.  Now I can write "su -;
mkdir /mnt/flash; mount /mnt/sda1 /mnt/flask" in my sleep but I do not
expect my mom to be able to handle that.

With a good XML system, it might add bloat to files, but it could have
most *likely* option configured, and then ignored, yet still commented. 
That way text junkies like myself can edit them.




(*) 4 of the 5 minutes will be spent re-editing the files as I fix
goofs, typos, and the normal complete insanity.

I think it would be great if PLUG could get more cross pollination with
the Northern Washington guys.  The NWLinuxFest was awesome, and it
needed more Portland people.

If you can make a road trip (announce to the list), this could be a lot
of fun for all.

Usenet news is far better than public mailing lists or web-based
messageboards from a end-user point of view, but the transport
system doesn't scale well, among other problems.  don't bother
setting up your own server unless a) you want to have local
newsgroups, or b) you have local readers who want a local cache
of particular newsgroups.  just point a newsreading program at
some existing server.  perhaps your ISP provides one.

there's also groups.google.com if you just want to see what it's
like, but the web interface is a lot more awkward than a good
newsreading client.

  News servers, such as inn, support Usenet. PLUG and others of us use mail
list managers (MLM) such as mailman, majordomo, ezmlm and others. Much
better, IMO.

A simple disable and enable of the network connection will keep you from having
to reboot when switching from static to dhcp.  ipconfig /release ipconfig
/renew might work too, but I've never tried it.

PLUG also provides an NNTP (i.e. USENET) server to gateway its mailing
list traffic.  Try news.pdxlinux.org.  It would be cooler if it didn't
expire its messages, but "oh well".

Webmin does this just fine. It is a Perl interface to the config files. You 
can edit the files directly, and Webmin does not get confused.

I like GUIs too. And I like being able to mix n match. There is no doubt 
setting up PPP from the command line is not for the faint of heart. 
BTW, I don't think you've set up a modem in windows for awhile...even in XP, 
their interface still sucks. It's not a straightforward, fill-in-the-blanks 
setup, but you have know which seekrit menus to dig up. Same for 
Ethernet. KPPP is way better.

> Now I LOVE GUI config programs.  Why?  For *other* people. 

I don't care if it works for "Joe and Tricia Sixpack". Joe and Tricia can't 
set up any kind of networking on windoze, or configure Zone Alarm, or set 
file permissions, or any basic admin task.  Joe and Tricia call people like 
me to set things up, so they can create documents and spreadsheets and 
diagrams and such, and not worry about system administration things. Even the 
best GUI is not telepathic, they still need to know what to do.

Well, I must have changed IP addresses 5 times yesterday, and it never
needed to reboot.  I also /release(d) and /renew(ed) about 10 times.  I
don't know what was special about the other night when it made me
reboot.

BTW, /release should be used if you change address spaces, but still
want to use DHCP, /renew is to have the DHCP client try to get a new
address, but it won't work if you have changed address spaces.

Oh, well.

I may be wrong here, but of all the strange things, I seem to recall that
if you change the DNS resolver address(es), that seems to make Win need to
reboot.

I don't know, I've used the standard install instructions and put it
onto three boxes running RH7.3. I'm pretty much a Linux Novice.
And as far as bulky and clunky, is that in comparison to something
speedy or just familiar? I'm familiar with MS Office, but it's slower
and clunkier to me. YMMV 
I will admit the first time I loaded Open Office, it was slow opening,
but once my defaults were set, it seems to move right along.
I also have Star Office installed and actually prefer it, but there
isn't a much difference between the two for me. A power user may have
more to say. 
Thanks for listening,

Topics were very slanted on groups.google.com and very messy 
too I might add.  Very hard to follow where there were so many
headers in a lot of messages with nothing under them.  An
incredible number of seemingly incomplete sound bytes are
in the postings.  Perhaps one could follow it if the lingo
were clear.  It's disturbing how disingenuous people can be
to each other on controversial topics along with the
number of postings that seem to be fired from the hip so
to speak.  Some sociologists say that the further we get
away from direct communication, the ruder we get even if
the communication is taking place within earshot of 
others out in public.

I'm still not seeing how a mailing list is different from the
news system.  On the one hand, I suppose you can look at news
like a bulletin board or a newspaper.  Is the difference where
and how usenet sites get edited?

As far as clean verses non clean usenet sites, what is that
about in the ISC blurb?  Why doesn't it scale well, isn't 
that only if the old style directory is used to store 
messages?

Okay, listen closely.  Here's the big picture.

The PURPOSE of mailing lists and news groups are not terribly
different.  The way they FUNCTION is.

A mailing list is hosted on a single server.  People subscribe to the
mailing list.  When someone sends a message to the mailing list
address, it goes to the server, and the server resends it to all the
subscribed addresses in its list.  People who aren't subscribed don't
get the messages.

A news group is part of a vast network of computers called USENET.
Subscribers connect to their local USENET server and ask it for the
messages that it is temporarily caching (days, weeks or months worth,
depending on the group and the server).  When the subscriber sends a
message to the news group, they send it to their local USENET server,
and that server then sends it on to all the other USENET servers it is
connected to, and thus the message gets flooded across the USENET
network and (hopefully) ends up on every other USENET server on the
planet, where another local subscriber can read it.

Which one scales better depends on how many readers and how many
servers there are.

It really would depend on the format of the config file. XML files should be
fine for reading/writing by both GUIs and manually, because they can be
validated against a DTD by the parser. So as long as the conf file still
validates after editing manually the GUI should still work.

XML can meet this need. The DTD defines the standard for a config file.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0310291403580.12217@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  On my older portable running apm, I could 'cat /proc/apm' to see the
operating time remaining on the battery. On the new laptop, when I use 'less
/proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/info' I see milliwatt hours, not hours and minutes.

  Is there a way to find the remaining time -- in hours:minutes -- from
acpi?

This may or may not help but in my experience with a custom
compile of apache 1.3.27 on Redhat I found that it was very
sensitive to the version of perl installed though that was
probably a path problem more than anything that I got around
by linking what use to be the directory for 5.6.0 perl to
5.6.1 perl.  It sounds like poor programming if it locks
up over a single file.  Maybe if you can find out where
this scoreboard file is supposed to be you can touch it,
this is required in some cases to get isc's dhcpd server
to go.

This brings up a major rpm problem, I think I ran into 
it because I compiled apache but it's really really 
annoying.  With dynamic libraries your supposed to be
able to upgrade the libraries without breaking 
programs, why does it so often fail to work in 
practice?

If apache has debugging extensions isn't there a way to
do ltrace or gdb or something and figure out from a
system profile of the program what it's doing wrong?
Another thing to look for is a .pid file, sometimes
these exist after the server is long since dead.

also, newsgroups are both global and decentralized, which is an
interesting trick.

having a list of "all" newsgroups is convenient, especially in the
days before Google.  still, it's a hassle to find mailing lists
and subscribe/unsubscribe to them.  subscribing/unsubscribing to
newsgroups is a lot less effort.

if I'm interested in reading about 500 mailing lists, there's a
lot of hassle involved, just managing my subscriptions.  also,
changing email address is annoyingly hard.  500 newsgroups are
quite easy to manage (though still time consuming to read).

a mailing list service like groups.yahoo.com helps some, but the
web interface is still quite clunky.  plus it isn't decentralized
like newsgroups are.

Message-ID: <1067467005.9589.5.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I may have actually gotten it to work.  I backed up full a redhat 6.2
system and restored that to a directory in an area I have some extra
space.  How can I essentially do an md5sum of the original files and 
the restored ones verifying that they are the same short of tarring 
the files I want to back up first and md5 summing that tarball to 
compare it to a restored copy later?

I've put limited data on the tape before thinking the tape might not
be rolling for larger backups, though it looks like the hard disk simply
filled up with the info file instead.  Should I put the info file on
a zip or something?  What are the files that taper creates anyways?

Maybe the temporary area for tarring the whole filesystem filled up
causing the approach of tarring directly to tape to fail.

How about writing a script that periodically (say every 5 minutes)
checks that info proc file and records the time and the milliwatt
hours left. Then let the battery go until it runs out, fit a nice
curve to the data and use it in the future for estimating the time
left on your battery. You could even redo the measurement occasionally
to get a measure of the condition of your battery.

 /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/ contains info, status and alarm "files".
info seems to be pretty static, however status gives a present rate (in mA),
and remaining capacity(mAh) entries.

mAh/mA = h => capacity/rate=time left.  IIRC, the sign changes on the
rate when you are charging the battery, so you can also get the time
to a full charge this way.

The gnome battery applet also does the conversion for you, if you're
into the gui thing.

If you do find/write a script, I'd like to use it also :)

Hey, 

Does anyone know of a great web based news feed app/script for linux?
I'd like something that I can cron every 6 hours or so to pull
highlights from slashdot, register, google, etc. I've seen a few on
freshmeat, but nothing that makes me tingle. 

Anyone have a favorite that they use? 

Thanks,

Huh?  If there is a bias, I've always thought it was towards the GNU
Hurd.  In fact, the canonical GRUB site:

  <http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/>

specifically says:

  ``We really need help by BSD hackers. Currently, almost nobody works
    for BSD-based operating systems, such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, and
    OpenBSD.''

so I am not sure where you get the "bias towards BSD".

I don't know.  I've only ever used the GRUB Manual at:

Have you tried just:

  mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
  grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda

The one caution I'd give is that there is some need to know what
devices are going to be installed on the recovered host.  See:

  <http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Device-map.html>

Basically, do the grub-install and then see what ends up in
/mnt/boot/grub/device.map.  If the device is going to end up on
/dev/hda1 (I assume you are mounting /dev/sda1 because it is
temporarily an external USB drive?), then device.map should probably
look like:

  (fd0)   /dev/fd0
  (hd0)   /dev/hda

As long as your BIOS doesn't try to boot installed SCSI devices first
and you are going to install the new drive as the Primary Master IDE,
then that should[1] be okay.

Michael,

  Do you want a copy of the text by itself? If so, print the page to disk as
a postscript file, then run that through ps2ascii or pstotext. You'll end up
with a text file you can format as you wish with any text processing tool.

A Cascading Style Sheet.

I haven't tried just a web browser but I have used wget to get copies of 
style sheets.  There should be an attribute like this

	src="/styles/thegreateststyle.css"

or

	src="http://example.com/styles/thengreateststyle.css"

when you view the page source.  Prepend the basename of the document
(http://greatproject.sourceforge.net/) to the first one or just use the
second one with wget.

Actually, I did try something very much like that, and it failed.  It
turns out that grub-install is flawed.  But grub-install is a shell
wrapper for "grub --batch", and I got what I wanted by embedding 
similar commands into my own shell script, like so:

  /sbin/grub --batch --device-map=/dev/null << EOF
  device (hd1) /dev/sda
  root (hd1,0)
  setup (hd1)
  quit
  EOF

Grub-install cannot be made to produce the "root (hd1,0)" line.  It will
only produce "root (hd0,0)" .   That's OK, feeding grub directly works
fine and removes a dependency on the behavior of grub-install.  

This is part of my automatic restore script, which is working fine EXCEPT
for what appears to be a usb2 bug.  I have some ideas about fixing the
bug - when that is done, I will post the whole restore script.  With the
usb2 flaw fixed, a bare restore of the server will consist of [1] putting
a new drive in a cage, [2] rebooting the server with the backup drive in
the main slot and the new drive in the usb2 backup slot, [3] adjusting
partition sizes in a table for differences between new and old drive size
[4] starting the restore script [5] going to a movie, since the restore
script takes about 2.5 hours for 60GB of data on the server [6] swapping
the drives [7] rebooting with an exact image of the server drive as of
the last backup time.

in mozilla firebird, in the "save page as" dialog, choose type
"web page, complete" instead of type "web page, html only".
in some other browsers, there's a checkbox "save with content".
or you can use "wget -k -p" etc.

Russell,

  I've tried that. The result is, "acpi: command not found". I have an acpid
but that doesn't return the time either.

What does "mini-PCI" mean in the table?
I was under the impression that most wireless cards for
desktop computers were PCMCIA cards mated to a PCI host board.

  The mini-PCI format is mostly meant for laptops and handhelds.  The
mini-PCI socket looks like a memory slot.  I have a number of SBC boards for
passive backplane servers that have a mini-PCI slot.  

You can find the spec here:

The cards look like this:

and I can't remember is it is just some settings in the SPEC file to 
compile mod_perl in to Apache.

Laptops have 'miniPCI' slots in 'em, where mini-PCI cards go.

AFAIK, these mini PCI cards work just like a full sized PCI card,
they're just made small enough to fit into a laptop.

My laptop's ethernet card is actually a miniPCI card.  I could, in
theory, pull it out and replace it with a different one, I think. 
Although, I really don't see any reason to do such a crazy thing.  :-)

That should be thank LG, makers of some of the finest boat anchors money can buy.


"The problem was that the kernel would send a FLUSH_CACHE command to the LG CD-ROM drive which would make the drive inoperable by overwriting its firmware. This is because some LG CD-ROM drives are not compliant with the ATAPI specification. The specification does not require an implementation of the FLUSH_CACHE command in the driver, and returning an error (or doing nothing) would have been the correct behaviour for the drive. Likewise, reusing a command is against the specification and LG has reused the FLUSH_CACHE command to modify the firmware of the drive, but they are unwilling to disclose exactly what the command does. This FLUSH_CACHE command is supposed to be supported only by CD-RW or DVD-RW devices; the LG-based CD-ROM devices are understanding this command as the UPLOAD_FIRMWARE command."

well, if some fancy-pants new wireless standard comes out you could 
upgrade your networking without upgrading your laptop..  though by the 
time it comes out it's likely the laptop will be a paperweight anyway, 
so yeah, it would be a crazy thing..

  I've been using an LG cdrom drive (connected to the notebook via a pcmcia
card) and it's worked just fine on the rare times I've needed it. This drive
was supported by the pcmcia.dsk with Slackware-8.1 but not with -9.0 or
-9.1. Shrug. The cdrom drive's OK based on my experience.

I'm sure there are good drives out there, but I haven't run into any yet. HP started using IDE LG drives on their C series HPUX systems about 2 years ago. In the last year and a half we have had to replace 12 cd drives (and we only have 8 of these machines). I have also seen 2 cd drives replaced in DELL laptops in the last year, all of which were LGs. I guess I just hope from a little more reliability than that.

  Well, Garl, that's the problem: the drives are too new. :-) I bought mine
about 4.5 years ago so perhaps they were more solid and reliable then.

Do not use apt-pinning for anything if you're using stable.  Mixing
the two is bound to give you some very, very broken perl, libc, and
python issues.  This has been repeated ad-nauseum on debian-user in
the last year or so.

Either I don't get it or this doesn't make sense.

Seems to me that you're going to get the highest version of each package
regardless of what deprecated versions you're putting in your apt-cache
with them old sources.

What's the point of keeping the stable sources in your sources.list if
you've got the testing sources there?

Since unstable STARTS as a copy of stable and then becomes testing, you
shouldn't have anything in stable that isn't in testing.

Slashdot and ElReg have RSS feeds, which you could use one of many
decent RSS aggregators. I like Straw if you swing the Gnome way.
Actually, I like the Summary page in Evolution as well as anything.

Google (News, I assume?) is tougher, but a quick '"google news" rss'

Thanks all. The key is web based. I don't want to have to run this in a
desktop. 

http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk seems to do the trick so far. And wow
what a ton of feeds it gets. Sadly, something's broken with theregister.


amphetadesk a perl script that runs it's own web listener on port 8888.
Since I'm not going to open up another port on the firewall, a quick
little apache rewrite rule saves the day, "RewriteRule     /news/(.*)
http://127.0.0.1:8888/$1 [P]"

thanks again.

MandrakeUpdate is the update tool. Works well - checks dependency during 
the updates. MandrakeUpdate along with rpmdrake and rpmdrake-remove make 
it easy to add and remove packages.

One thing I like to do is set the sources to include a local file. When 
I want rpmdrake to check dependency for me I put the rpm to be installed 
in that directory.

I don't know when the drivers will arrive, but I am told the Atheros
chipset will be supported by an open source Linux driver.  The long-time
friend of open source Sam Leffler (hylafax) will be driving that effort.

Note also that you probably do NOT want to put a PCI wireless card into
a typical desktop.  The external Wireless Access Points do just fine, 
and are configurable from web pages;  they are more-or-less OS agnostic.
There are some WAPs (linksys??) that can have the firmware upgraded,
and some folks are actually running embedded Linux on the WAP!

If you have a laptop, you probably want a PCMCIA card, not a PCI card.
The mini-PCI cards are good only if you have built-in antennas.  Find
a PCMCIA card with a PRISM-II chipset, and look for SENAO or rebranded
cards, with 200mW output.  Also, you will get better range if you can
use an external antenna.

The Personal Telco Project people are mostly Linux savvy (most of the
repeaters are based on Soekris boards running Linux from flash disk),
and about half the laptops are running Linux, too.  Look at their
site www.personaltelco.net for more useful information.

Let it go Jeme.  Same to you Paul.  What is this accomplishing?
Debian can be difficult to work with, but I think it has great
potential.  My interest is in balancing good design and 
flexibility with enough ease of use so that people like 
me and potentially customers in the future don't go crazy
trying to use Linux.

I'm not sure I want to try Debian alone, with a little
experience with it I'd say that's pushing it.  Still,
it looks like debian is very rewarding to those who
can understand it well enough.  I'd say slackware is
good too, but isn't the documentation of Slack like
the worst on the planet?  I guess Redhat's docs aren't
great.

Why's that?  Perhaps there's an install hurdle, but I don't know any
system that doesn't have such a thing.  You have to know SOMETHING about a
computer to install an OS on it from bare metal.

Honestly, I don't think it takes any more understanding than any other
unix-like system for basic use and administration... and perhaps less
effort, as well.

I've always said that the only real purpose of a distribution is the
package management system.  I think that, in this respect, Debian has the
others beat hands down.

If it's a system I'm going to use frequently and others do not depend on
its availability, however, I'm just going to forego the whole
"distribution" concept and get my source from the maintainers.

The PCI wireless cards themselves are fine, its the antennae that they come with that suck so bad.  At least get a 3 or 4 foot cable with a desk mount antenna.

I haven't tried to build a wireless network with only external WAP's,
how is that done?  Ad-hoc (or peer-to-peer) mode?

> There are some WAPs (linksys??) that can have the firmware upgraded,
> and some folks are actually running embedded Linux on the WAP!

Now that sounds interesting.

The NetGear MA311 runs well with the hostap drivers.  Don't forget to
get a better antenna.

I've also gotten a couple of usb wireless devices working under linux,
but they have very poor range and can't be brought up in "Master" mode. 
And one of them was randomly regenerating its MAC address every 30 sec.

I've had lots of problems with the off the shelf WAP's, a lot more than
when running a PC based linux firewall/AP with a PCI card.  It is
infinitely more configurable, and much more user friendly to have your
connection inside your box.

Good Luck,

Derek Loree

In my experience, mixed Debian only works for testing/unstable in the
long run. Usually, and especially at the moment, the glibc in testing is
so far ahead of stable that no packages will install. Unless you *want*
to install a newer glibc. But I'd think that'd kind of defeat the
purpose of the whole exercise. In fact, I keep a specific stable UML
instance around that has build tools just to build the odd package that
I want from testing, without exposing my firewall UML to the hazards of
having build tools or large amounts of generally unnecessary libraries.

That said, it's a lot easier than pinning these days. In
/etc/apt/apt.conf put the following:

APT::Default-Release "stable";

Then make sure in your sources.list you use "stable" and "testing"
instead of, say, "woody" and "sarge". Then whenever you want a testing
version, try "apt-get install foo/testing" and it will *try* to install
the testing version (and let it upgrade from testing hereafter). It will
not, however, try to install any dependencies without your permission
(to avoid the above where it might install an unstable glibc, e.g.). If
you wish to install them too, apt-get will tell you which dependencies
are unsatisified and you can provide them additionally on the install
line. Yes, this is less convenient, but it is safe. It is only necessary
for where stable versions cannot satisfy requirements. And once
installed, the libraries will track the testing versions.

Another advantage to having testing sources available is that you can do
"fakeroot apt-get -b source foo/testing" to do a build from testing
sources. If the package only uses auto dependencies for libraries, this
may get around the above issues (if the package will build in stable
otherwise), but it will not track the latest versions. Additionally, if
the package uses explicit dependencies to avoid a specific, obscure bug,
you can also do "apt-get source foo/testing" then "cd
foo-version.number", edit debian/control and remove the dependencies
version numbers, then run "dpkg-buildpackage -uc -b -rfakeroot". Don't
hope it will build without all it's dep's, though. Do make a best
effort to get stable versions of missing libraries or get testing
versions of libraries where possible (and where they have unsatisifiable
requirements such as glibc, build those libraries from source as we have
described here).

Yes building from source like this is not particularly any better than
most other distributions. However, unlike trying to make Mandrake
packages build from .src.rpm's under Red Hat, at least you're building
packages designed for Debian, just not fully authorized for stable yet.
Also, you can use methods described here to tweak packages and build
them with newer optimization flags. *wink wink Gentoo* That can require
putting packages on hold, though, or at least incrementing the revision
number to help apt avoid getting a new version just right away. (Use
"dch -i" to edit the changelog which affects the version of the package
directly, and edit the new version it assigns to the previos version
plus a ".", i.e. if the package is presently "-1", and dch gives the new
changelog entry "-2", change it to "-1.0.me.1" to avoid conflicting any
newer versions the pool may distribute.) I do hear from time to time on
debian-devel that some people are actually working on automated
source-build and update tools.

I hope you find this useful.

Good point - but the antennae are a bit harder to find.  Also, note that
there will be significant cable losses if you try to go more than a few
feet, or aren't using top-quality cable.  

I found it easier to just perch a WAP on a high shelf, and run ethernet
and power up to it.  Antenna placement can be nasty.

No, regular old managed mode, with the WAP serving DHCP and so forth.
I suppose there could be problems with handoff - I only have one WAP,
so I haven't worked that out yet.  You will have the same problem with
PCI/Linux-box wireless systems;  you will need to make the systems hand
off connection information one to another.  It can be done.

Sometimes infinite configurability is NOT a feature :-).  But that
wouldn't be us, would it?  :-) :-)

The problem with most wireless cards is that many do not have Linux
drivers, and the manufacturers have a tendency to change chipsets and
keep the same model number.  I'd guess that 60% of the hardware on the
shelf at Fry's doesn't have Linux drivers.  If you do a LOT of research
before buying, you can probably reliably buy a card with a supported
chipset.

On the other hand, if you get a web-configurable WAP, you may not get
all the configurability you would like, and you might not be able to
coordinate a mesh of WAPs, but you are almost guaranteed compatability,
because web browsers are mostly OS agnostic.  And you can usually find
out about web-configurability from the product box.

Case in point - I purchased a Siemens PCMCIA card for my laptop, and
a Siemens WAP, real cheap from Frys.  Well, the PCMCIA card uses the
TI chipset (on the wlan website, it says PRISM2) and while there is 
a Linux driver development program going on, it is nowhere near ready
for prime time.  The WAP, on the other hand, was up and running in about
30 minutes with DHCP, 128 bit WEP, and similar goodies.  Granted, I was
*not* able to do things like force a fixed address for the laptop, and
the WAP wants to be its own little firewall, but I can live with such
annoyances.

When I go for configurability, I will either use an old laptop as an
access point, or I will go for a Soekris box.  Either way, I can 
move the box right up next to the antenna, and I will be using a
PCMCIA card.  Given that the PCMCIA cards are cheaper (higher volume,
and the PCI cards are often a PCMCIA card mounted in a box on a PC
board) and more versatile, and don't need extra cabling to get to
a decent antenna mount point, this is probably a better way to go.

BTW, I hope to take one of my old TP560 laptops and put a couple of
PRISM2 PCMCIA cards in it, make it into a WAP/repeater, and broadcast
"Radio Free Linux" from my attic.  Since my comcast TOS does not permit
me to broadcast internet access, I will probably just serve up local
content - a dozen or so downloadable Linux distros.

I wouldn't call it a "favorite" (it's still rough around the edges), but
Straw is a decent GTK2-based RSS aggregator (I assume this is what you
mean by "news feed" app). AFAIK, it does *not* have any command-line
flags that would make it scriptable. It's written in Python, though, so
if you're a good Py-hacker you might be able to tweak it to do what you
want. :-)

The crux of the problem with saying distributions 
are just about package management is that 
unlocking a distribution and getting the most 
benefit out of it over say spending the extra 
time to build your own thing from source is 
one of the major reasons to use distributions.  

I think the rpm idea is fine, problem is the 
dependency database needs to be trainable so 
that if say I compile something on an rpm 
system I can find out what packages on that 
system need to be installed for it to work 
installing it as a package with those 
dependencies.  In the case of binaries, if 
I can find out that binary a works with 
library b, than I should be able to say 
that binary a or package a can use library 
b in the absence of library a.  Another 
problem is linking libraries, traditionally 
any upgade of a library should I believe 
be compatible with programs using the old 
version potentially fixing some bug or 
improving performance.  

For perl-5.6.0 and perl-5.6.1, why can't 
I install both of them side by side?  The 
obvious problem is the collision of the 
perl binary but that's about it.  I guess 
I ran into this because of statically 
compiled apache where I kludged by 
linking the 5.6.0 tree to 5.6.1 tree 
to satisfy an apache.pm dependency.  
I wonder if this was a good hack or 
a bad hack, that would require testing
which I'm not 100% certain how to do.

Maybe a smarter idea is to install a 
universal micro distribution with 
only the things anyone would install 
setting up Linux and then force the 
building of the other packages and 
their dependency information with 
nice menuconfig like menus showing 
what the default vendor settings 
are.  In cases where you want to
install packages default compiled, 
you can then install binaries 
direct.  I think it would be wise 
for every distro to go to a micro 
footprint to start out with 
including for X windows.  With 
twm and XFree86, that should be 
plenty even in standard vga mode 
to implement a package selection 
system like the Redhat and Mandrake 
installers.  Move to xml config files 
and maybe we can have config files 
that aren't broken by those of us 
who want to hand edit them when 
graphical tools are used.

For programmers, the better one 
can do at not requiring a recompile
to change the features, options, or 
configuration of a program the more 
sense binaries are going to make.  
If however paths have to be compiled 
in or leaving certain things compiled 
out like Japanese fonts is required so 
that you don't have to install the 
Japanese fonts stuff, that makes 
binaries less attractive.  I guess 
under X things have been done to 
try to fix the path problem, why 
are fonts so so screwed up under 
Redhat 7.3 out of the box though?  
Is there a HOWTO on fixing the 
fonts in a default Redhat system?  
I'm just guessing here, but in my 
experience it seems console fonts 
and X under Redhat are incompatible 
if one attempts to use both X and 
console fonts modification.  Maybe 
this is a case of ignoring what's
in the video card's cache or the 
ram side video cache when X is run.  
My biggest challenge if I stay a 
programmer is staying up to date 
on a continuous basis regarding
how to program properly, 
efficiently, securely...

In the case of files for packages 
that aren't installed, it would be 
cool if these files were hidden.  
It would also be cool if the password
file had a hidden portion for user 
accounts needed by programs or services 
that aren't installed.  I guess the 
other option is to just never add 
an account where a default vendor 
one may need to be, though simply 
keeping all vendor accounts is evidently 
dangerous and for reasons I don't fully 
understand certain accounts should be 
below 1023 even if they aren't default 
ones.

The problem of vendors changing electronics or code in 
the same numbered version of a product where the change 
isn't transparent concerns me.  How many problems are 
real bugs verses unexpected changes to hardware or 
violation of standards where the LG cdrom drives and
Mandrake comes to mind?  One solution to make Linux 
run better is to encourage or start a company that 
specifically makes hardware to work with Linux in a 
well understood well engineered manner.  If you can 
release the blueprints  with Linux hardware your 
doing exceptionally well at improving Linux system 
quality.  Is it possible to get any hardware or 
software that is completely compliant to standards?  
After reading some of the recommended documents on 
ATA, I daresay that I'm thinking the answer to the 
last question is no.

My greatest disgust is with optimizations.  They 
don't seem to be done very well in the PC world.  
One argument is that we should be able to compile 
programs the same way we did back in the 386 days 
where optimization should be put into libraries 
and chosen at runtime in a well defined manner.  
One thing that bothers me is how Intel is saying 
we should program with special instruction sets 
and in different ways to improve program speed 
claiming Itanium is the thing even over alpha, 
but at what cost I wonder?  Retooling hurts 
where the beauty of Unix is getting away from 
obscure concepts of blocks and records, 
shifting verses loading a new value into a 
register, add another one here...  Compilers 
should figure out some of this for us.

If man pages are compiled with the source, how many
on the list know how to test the outcome of the man
page against the options compiled into the software 
that's going to be installed?  If some option is left
out, the instructions for it shouldn't be in the man 
pages that will be installed.

In regard to understanding a distribution or Calculus
based physics for example, it helps to know how to
think when studying it in a way that will lead in
a helpful direction.  There need to be projects that
do nothing but work on making it easier to grasp
Linux in a broad sense and specific distributions
in a narrower sense.

Sorry, though it does cut down on the number of posts ;-)

At PSU a guy named Jeme something set up a Linux Lab on
Debian, but he used a testing version and many things were
clearly broken that normally aren't.  Add to this Jonathan
Nix deciding to take excessive class time focusing on XP, 
cs200 there was awful.  The thing that blew me away is how
strong the anti OSS anti Linux sentiment was.

I tried to complain to Cynthia Brown about not having a 
suitably Linux savvy instructor for the course, but I 
don't think she cared or even listened to what I said.  
I'll always wonder how I got through, I had fun doing
inline assembly in gcc despite the instructor's 
insistence everyone should use visual studio instead.  
I wish Jeme had showed a little more backbone about 
the resources for the class being Linux and not Windows
based.  I took the course with the understanding it
would be geared for Linux systems ending up unsupported
and criticized.  Leaves me wondering where to finish
my CS degree or if this degree isn't helpful for an 
aspiring Linux network security/systems specialist.

Rich,

Is ACPI working for you at all?  Do you see anything useful in /proc/acpi/battery/*?

ACPI in kernel 2.4.20 is all but hopeless, requiring a special dsdt file to be compiled into your source tree, which has to match your BIOS version, etcetera.  But 2.4.22 (and 2.6.0) worked for me without any rigamarole.

Once you have that going, you can use acpid to manage power events, such as low battery warnings.

Jason,

  Yes. It's all there.

  According to Lincoln Durey at EmperorLinux, Sony has removed apm from the
Vaio and there are problems with the 2.4.22 kernel with some built-in
capabilities (I don't recall just which).

  I'll pass this on to him. They -- Emperor Linux -- tweak the kernel for
each machine they sell so as to fully support all the hardware. I've no idea
what I'd break by booting the stock Slackware 2.4.22 kernel; of course, I
can always try. :-)

  Sony is supposed to have a 'vaiobat' utilitiy, but I cannot find it on the
hard drive. I've sent an e-mail asking for it but have not yet received a
response.

The dependency tracking is provided by the programs like apt or yum that 
have a view of all the available packages.

Most upgrades of libraries are compatible.  For example, with the most 
recent security patches for openssl, a new shared library replaced the 
old one and every program that used it got the bug fix.

But sometimes there are incompatible changes in the interface.  For 
example, going from glibc 2.2 in Red Hat 7.x to glibc 2.3 in RH 8/9 was 
a big change.  It should be possible to make old programs with the new 
library but it is safer just to use the program with the libary is was 
compiled against.  One of the nice things about the Linux versioned 
libraries is that it is possible to have multiple versions installed.

You can install them side by side.  Most package systems don't handle 
having two versions of the same thing.  The lib directories are 
separated by version.  Most pure-Perl modules can be shared but binary 
modules have the same compatibility problems as other shared libraries. 
  They only reliably with the version they were compiled against and 
require the same compiler that compiled Perl.

...too bad it's just the right tool for some jobs.

I'm trying to extract rfc/822 attachments out of emails.  Forwards. 
Easier said than done, I'm finding.

I'm making progress, but have hit a major stumbling block, I can't get
the last boundary to NOT print.  It just absolutely wants to print, no
matter what.  Well, that isn't accurate.  It wants to print, no matter
what, if the attached message uses MIME, itself.  If the attached
message is all plaintext, then the bottom boundary does *not* print, as
it should be.

I'm stumped.  Any ideas?  This is the *first* perl script I've ever
written, so be gentle.  :-)

It's still rough around the edges with a few things that need to be
worked out, but as it stands now it is usable, just adding whitespace at
the top and the bottom boundary if there's extra MIME in there.  It also
assumes Content-Type is the last line in the MIME header - these will be
fixed, I have ideas... if I can get the blasted last boundry to stop
printing.  :-)

Any thoughts?

#!/usr/bin/perl

$bound = 1;		#Unless this is false, keep checking for tbound
$tbound = "No Boundry";	#True boundary - need for begining and ending
$lastline = "";		#The line before the current one.

while (<>) {
  chomp $_;

  if ($_ =~ /^--=-/ && $bound){   #that regex isn't going to work 
				  #outside of testing
     $tbound = $_;	#When we have a boundry before bound is set (rfc822)
			#tbound is set to it.  After we hit the rfc822 line,
			#we won't be defining it any more.
  }

  if ($lastline =~ /^Content-Type: message\/rfc822/){
     $bound = 0;	#Set bound to false so we start printing
  }

  if ($tbound =~ /--/ && !($bound)) {
        print "$_\n" unless ($_ =~ $tbound); #Should print all lines not 
					     #matching $tbound after $bound 
					     #is set to 0
  }

  $lastline = $_;	#Defining lastline so we don't print the Content line
}

Hiya, this won't help if you're determined to do it "the hard way",
but there's a handy perl module called MIME::Parser that's designed
to do exactly this extraction, and will save you a lot of grief. It
is part of the standard MIME-Tools suite. "perldoc MIME::Parser"
seems to have much sample code.

Hiya folks.  I'm looking for the equivalent to the Intraserver 3140U
cards that alpha used to run.  I believe they were 64 bit and that
Linux supported them.  Trouble is, LSI logic bought these out and
changed the name.  So what should I look for nowadays?

Cool.

That comes close to doing exactly what I need.  The only problem I have
with it is I can't get the output to go to stdout.  I think I can deal
with that, though, with a bash script and some cat usage. 

I still do wonder, however, why my script didn't work...  :-)

Thanks!

   Yup. They are apparently off the air today. The messages I received was
that there was no A record for that domain. Hmmm-m-m. I would not be
surprised to learn that a spammer has messed with them.

Here's what lspci says about mine:
00:0b.0 SCSI storage controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic (formerly NCR) 53c875 (rev 04)

LSI's website lists some of their SCSI adapters:
