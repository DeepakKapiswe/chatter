I figured out that if I "sudo killall NetworkManager" followed by
"sudo NetworkManager" all becomes right as rain again.

Not to nitpick, but did you realize you created the "Porland Linux/UNIX

   I, too, had a Libretto 70, but mine ran Red Hat ... 5.x? However, I could
not touch-type on the keyboard, even with my fingers jammed tightly
together. While I really liked the small size (and it ran Xfce very nicely),
I soon sold it and replaced it with the Toshiba Portege 3025CT.

Thanks, I hadn't noticed that. My typing has been kinda lousy lately.
I'll blame adjusting to this Kinesis keyboard.

What I use these days:
 o Sound Juicer, with MusicBrainz support (I used 'grip' until recently,
but I have since found SJ to be easier and has built-in MusicBrainz
support)
 o If I need CDDB support, I use the MusicBrainz gateway:
http://musicbrainz.org/doc/FreeDBGateway
 o Tag Tool (MusicBrainz has a tag editor called "Picard", but it hasn't
been in the Fedora repos until very recently, so I have not had much
chance to use it)

The few music players that I have used have sorted on track number by
default (after grouping by artist and title), which is oddly sensible
and doesn't actually require reference data sources like most of the
other attributes.

Message-ID: <d0ad9b7e0712010926o7d1af713sced3df6f59fcbcdb@mail.gmail.com>

One other thing we have to look at: in getting rid of appBase, the
files are no longer shared between apps. So, does this effect the
performance in any way?

I say we set up 25 instances of the app in 5 instances of tomcat and
hit it w/ jmeter. then go to 50 or more.

We may want to do away w/ undeploy -- I can't think why we would need
it -- and just use a shared appBase, if performance degrades w/o it.
But I doubt it, as long as there is sufficient disk space to hold the
cached files.

And, btw, as soon as an app is shutdown, or tomcat itself, all the
appBase files in the work directory are removed by tomcat. So, they
don't linger.

At home I am wired so I use wireless only away from home, which 90% of
the time is at PSU. Next time I am there I will give this a try.

My T61 has the Intel 4965AGN wireless chip and it "disconnects" me
anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or so after connecting. That is,
everything says I am still connected, but I suddenly can't go anywhere.
I use Wifi Radar mostly, because network manager can't even seem to
scan for networks. If I open Wifi Radar after being "disconnected" it
shows me as still connected and still shows the IP address.

When I boot I can immediately launch Firefox, try to go to PSU home
page, and I will always get the login screen and be able to log in to
pbnet.pdx.edu. Thereafter it is fine until I get "disconnected."
Network manager shows no change, but then, it never tells me much. From
the command line ifconfig shows everything normal. I have to reboot to
get wireless working again, and once even that didn't work - I had to
go into the BIOS, disable radio, boot, shut down and reboot, go into
the BIOS again, enable radio, and then finally boot to get the wireless
back.

Yesterday I discovered that by alternating between command line and
Wifi Radar I could get it working again without rebooting. I used "sudo
ifconfig down -a," then launched Wifi Radar to make sure it found no
networks, then "sudo ifconfig up -a." That still did not connect me.
For example, if I tried going to PSU home with Firefox it would still
not go there. But at that point I could launch Wifi Radar again, it
would see the networks, I could use Wifi Radar to connect to
pubnet.pdx.edu and get an IP address, and then Firefox would give me
the pubnet.pdx.edu login window again. 

This is a PITA. I understand the problem is the driver that Intel wrote
for 64-bit Linux. As far as I know it affects only 64-bit and only the
4965AGN chip. I have also read a couple of similar complaints from
users of 64-bit Vista.

Next time I am somewhere and get "disconnected" I will try the killall
trick to see if that works. It would be faster and simpler than what I
have been doing. Meantime, I would like to diagnose more accurately
exactly what is happening. I know next to nothing of how networking
works, let alone wireless. But there should be some command line things
I could use, or log files I could look at, that would tell the exact
story. Knowing exactly what is happening strikes me as the first step
toward fixing the problem - assuming that I can fix it from my end
without begging Intel for a better driver.

                                 Introduction
                                      to
                          The R Programming Language

                                      by

                                 Brian Knaus
                       <knausb at science.oregonstate.edu>

      R is an Open Source implementation of the S statistical
      programming language.  In fact, R is the most widely used
      open source software package for statistical software development
      and data analysis, and has become a de-facto standard among
      statisticians for the development of statistical software.

      R supports a wide variety of statistical and numerical techniques
      and has excellent graphical facilities, which can produce
      publication-quality graphs which can include such things as
      mathematical symbols and maps and other complex features.
      R is also highly extensible through the use of packages,
      which are user-submitted libraries for specific functions
      or specific areas of study.  As a result, R has been extended
      to work well with postgres, GRASS, and many other software products.

      *******************************************************************

          Agenda:

              7:00 - 7:30  Business
                   We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects
                   including PLUG's monthly Advanced Topics meetings,

Ya, that's what I need, track numbering in the ID3 tags. Because each
Barron's language CD has over 50 tracks, and they need to be played in
order automatically, especially on an iPod like device, for correct
flow of the course material.

Strike two for Macs: 1) no USB support that makes any sense
whatsoever, and CD drives/drivers that fail on disk scratches that
Linux doesn't even flinch on. Sigh.

Message-ID: <20071203162007.GA5389@gate.kl-ic.com>


Folks:

I still have a couple boxes of PLUG library books.  The list of what's
available is at http://www.pdxlinux.org/wiki/PlugLibrary .  There are
plenty of brand new books on current topics.

If you want to check one or two out for extended use, please look at
the wiki for the procedure, and give me a couple of days warning so
I will remember to put the desired books in the car.

I made a logo to put in place of the "in Group" logo that's there now.
 It's nothing impressive, but it does have have the "t" in Portland.
Wil, let me know if you want to use it.

My ripping is done through the K3b frontend which uses lame for mp3 encoding.
The inclusion of track numbers is directly supported. 

My lame configuration is:
lame -h --tt %t  --ta %a --tl %m --ty %y --tn %n --tc %c - %f -V 0 --add-id3v2 

Where --tn is the lame argument for track number and %n provides the value. 

The track number is derived from the physical layout of the CD.  All other
information comes from cddb lookups.

Other infobits:
%t - Title
%a - Artist
%m - Album Title
%y - Release Year
%n - Track number
%c - Comment
%r - Album Artist
%x - Album comment

Now, that's >really< close to what I need. The question is, how to
feed this setting into k3b. I am really version 0.12.17, and don't see
where I can directly add that string for lame, though I do see where I

Naming". I'll be trying to figure it out, poking around, but if you
have a moment, let me know details. Almost...there....

I have a T61 working with Gutsy without much hassle at all.
Following the Thinkwiki guide to installing and configuring,  
everything works (sound, usb, wifi, card reader).
The only problem I have is that Compiz has some hardware overlay  
issues with the Intel GMA3100 video, which will hopefully be resolved  
in a driver update.

All volume controls, mute, brightness, Media keys (next track, pause,  
etc), special functions buttons like Sleep, Monitor Mode, Lock, and  
EasyJect all work as well with zero configuration.

http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Ubuntu_7.10_%28Gutsy_Gibbon%29_on_a_ThinkPad_T61

The T61, despite some minor driver issues which are mostly resolved,  
has been pleasent to use under Ubuntu

 From the Wiki though, it looks like those with Nvidia cards, and the  
N wireless adapters still have some small issues.

That be me.

I have a T61 with nVidia and 4965AGN on Gutsy x86_64. I finally got the
video working right, although Gutsy did not autodetect and configure
anything. The wireless sort of works, but I get disconnected at random.

Everything else is working perfectly, except I have an issue with
bluetooth. I use a bluetooth mouse (Logitech V270) and bluetooth
headphones (Sony DR-BT50). Both work beautifully, but when I use the
headphones the sound cuts out for a second or so when I use the mouse.
I have spent hours trying to figure out bluetooth and what is going on.

I also have the issue with the two back right USB ports that no longer
work once you unplug anything. I have read of a fix but it seemed more
compllicated than it was worth. Normally I never use a USB port and, if
I do, I use the one on the left side.

The only problems I want to fix are the bluetooth headphones cutting
out and the wireless disconnecting. Otherwise everything meets my needs
just fine.

Up until Gutsy I have never had a problem with SAMBA shares.
They had previous showed up in remote places with NO issues.
With Gutsy, the SAMBA server shows up but I can't see anything in it.
I can however now see all of the Windows shared folders on my windows boxin.

A huge win for readers is how Bruce embedded links in almost every answer he

Highly recommended.

Seconded!

Bruce's is the only blog I read regularly. In fact, I rarely even go 
to the blog itself since the full text of his articles is available 
via an RSS feed:

Message-ID: <30099.170.135.241.46.1196882611.squirrel@mail.patch.com>

A co-worker has installed Gutsy Gibbon on a spare PC here.

He doesn't know enough to have mucked up the config.

When we ssh to the box our sessions are disconnected after a few minutes.  I have
not been able to determine the frequency yet.  I don't know if it's every X
minutes or semi-random.

The PC does have a dhcp derived address with a lease time of a week.

Nothing in the sshd_config points to a time out value.

We get disconnected in the middle of typing a command, so I'm reasonably sure it
isn't an inactivity timer.

What suggestions do you have for diagnosing this?

I can't help but note that he endorses the Personal Telco view on
sharing your wireless connection:

   A: I run an open wireless network at home. There's no password, and
      there's no encryption. Honestly, I think it's just polite. Why
      should I care if someone on the block steals wireless access
      from me? When my wireless router broke last month, I used a
      neighbor's access until I replaced it.

Honestly, I think it's just polite.

We don't have other connection types.

More information:

it seems not to be periodic, two simultaneous sessions have different lifetimes.
Ubuntu user forums show reports of the issue
I've updated KeepAlive parameters in sshd_config with no effect.

Have you tried increasing the LogLevel in sshd_config?  The options
for it are in the sshd_config man page.  It goes up to DEBUG3.
Hopefully, it should tell you something at one of the DEBUG levels.

I have the server version installed on a machine.  I was doing all my
admin thru ssh
for several hours without error.  Just a switch between machines.

Maybe it is the source machine interface getting changed or something
between the
machines.

Gusty version of samba seems like it doesn't like to become master on
the network if
something already has a workgroup set.

The other problem I had was that I could not get the guest account to
connect correctly when
obey pam was set.

Seems to work for me, but I was surprised to see even the local [Homes]
share commented out by default. Can you tell us more? Have you checked
the contents of the /var/log/samba directory on the Samba server?

Thanks,

                                 Introduction
                                      to
                          The R Programming Language

                                      by

                       <knausb at science.oregonstate.edu>

      R is an Open Source implementation of the S statistical
      programming language.  In fact, R is the most widely used
      open source software package for statistical software development
      and data analysis, and has become a de-facto standard among
      statisticians for the development of statistical software.

      R supports a wide variety of statistical and numerical techniques
      and has excellent graphical facilities, which can produce
      publication-quality graphs which can include such things as
      mathematical symbols and maps and other complex features.
      R is also highly extensible through the use of packages,
      which are user-submitted libraries for specific functions
      or specific areas of study.  As a result, R has been extended
      to work well with postgres, GRASS, and many other software products.

Don't know if this helps, but this was happening to me when I was
going out through an IPCop box. I had to drop one of the firewall
rules that was there to prevent some M$ Windows vulnerability; I don't
use Windows. I don't know why it worked, but commenting out that rule
in the firewall did work. How this doesn't lead you astray. I can send
the exact rule if you want to see it.

I have a gateway, router 2, inbetween it and the router, router 1, I

I've tried 
iptables -A PREROUTING -t mangle -j MARK --set-mark=3 \
         -s $client --dport 80

from router 1.

What do I do on router 2???

Yes, I've added fwmark 3 to table 2 and pointed table 2 at router 2.

Any chance that the dhcp address is accidentally being used by another
machine?

Is it just ssh sessions, or are other connections dropped as well?

No.  We have ~60,000 dhcp clients.  If dup addresses were a problem it would be a
known problem.

As stated before, the only persisting sessions are ssh.

        Partial Resolution

We changed the address to a static DHCP config.
We (ahem, I'm working with windows folks) the machine after correcting the time
configuration.

I'm inclined to believe that having the clock out of sync with the clients was the
root of the problem.

I term this a partial resolution because I don't know why it's working now, just
that it is.

Probably kerberos.  Is it an Active Directory domain?  Windows AD
requires client and server to be within 5 minutes of each other.

Subject: [PLUG] Wifi card
Message-ID: <665390.7832.qm@web50612.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

When I ordered a laptop, the vendor provided a random PCMCIA wireless adapter, Airlink 101 (AWLC3028). Knoppix does not recognize it out of the box. (I do not yet have Linux installed on the laptop HD.) Still, this indicates that the installation will probably be tricky--madwifi, ndiswrapper, or whatever. Is this card properly supported in Linux? Or should I get a different one, if my intention is to use Wifi with Linux?

Linux has not caught up with the world of Wifi. The hardware drivers seem to
be a problem. I've had good luck using a Linksys PC Card (Model Noumber
WPC11 version 3). I've had good luck with the Ubuntu Linux distro to detect
this card. 

You can try using ndiswrapper, but that is just a tool/wrapper program that
allows Linux to use the Microsoft Windows driver.

Good luck!

That would only affect the initiation of the connection, not the

I wanted to post this so that everyone would have the appropriate links. The

happens there (see Eclipse demos, talk about Eclipse with Eclipse
Developers), and how to get there (directions to Kennedy School). It'll be

You need the MadWifi drivers.  That card is an Atheros chipset.  I have a
similar card and it works fine with that set of drivers.

In Fedora, it is easy. You use one of the repositories that has the madwifi
package and install it.  (I use the one off FreshRPMs.net.)  It compiles the
kernel module for you.  Very easy.  Not certain what you do to get it to
work with Knoppix.

Linux support for Atheros chipsets is pretty good.  Two years ago I
had to do quite a bit of work to get the madwifi drivers working on my
laptop.  A week ago I set up a Gentoo laptop with an Atheros wifi
card, and it was a snap, even with WPA encryption via wpa_supplicant.
I don't know how Knoppix does with madwifi, but kernel support is
definitely there.

Madwifi has indeed been one of the more solid linux drivers.  But
considering that none of them has been *that* solid, it might fall
into the category of "faint praise".  Historically, the hostap-driver
for prism chips was really solid.  Some of the other 11b devices had
decent if divergent support.  I have been using madwifi-old for a
couple years with the atheros radio in my thinkpad (I am sticking with
madwifi-old because it works reliably and since I am often diagnosing
weirdness at PTP nodes, I would rather not have that muddled up by
having weirdness on my own radio.  I've used madwifi-ng extensively in
embedded applications, which has been less solid for me.  Madwifi
(both -old and -ng) relies on a binary blob, the so-called HAL
(hardware abstraction layer).  Over the last year to 18 months there
has been a lot of work on the "mac80211" wifi stack for linux, and in
in the last few months also the ath5k driver for atheros radios.  I
haven't tried it yet, but my impression from reading the relevant
mailing lists is that it's still a bit rough.  Which is completely
understandable, considering the lack of support that most driver
writers get from hardware vendors.  My guess is that it'll be another
6 months before things really start converging on "solid" and wifi
support gets better on linux.  In the meantime, find whatever life
raft you can.  "There's hope.  No Luke Skywalker in sight."

This is actually a problem for the UNIX class I'm taking. (We're not 
supposed to collaborate with other students on this, but we ARE allowed 
to seek help on the net, etc). Here is the question and the hint 
provided by the instructor.

:QUESTION [40 pts]
      Write a bash script that reads a submission file, extracts all sed
      programs, and then runs the sed program against a COPY of the
      submission file.

HINT
      My bash script uses grep and sed, but awk also could be used.  I use
      the script to process submissions.  In order to simpify this
      question, however, I will make the following unrealistic
      assumptions:

        -All sed commands are one-liners
        -All sed commands start and end with ' and have NO embedded '
         or " characters.
        -All sed commands start at the beginning of a line, and can be
         found with:
               grep -r "^sed[^']*'" | cut -f2 -d"'"
        - The above grep will find ONLY sed commands

          These assumptions are NOT realistic as far as the "real world" but
          should make the script easier to write.  Your script can accept a
          file name on the command line, then create a backup copy.  You 
can use
          the grep command to extract all of the sed programs from the file.
          Think about using a second command file to process the grep 
output.
          To process a file line by line you can use the "read" command.  If
          "myCmd" is the script:
     
      #!/bin/bash
      while read line
      do
        echo "Line: $line"
          done
     
      then you can process a file with the sequence "cat file | myCmd"

it difficult to determine that the initial root password is root.  This

I see.  I, for one, greatly appreciate your honesty.  However, in
general, asking other folks to do your homework for you is frowned upon,
and goes rather beyond the spirit of merely "seeking help".

I would suggest you start figuring out how to get BASH to make a read an
input file, then get it to recognize the SED programs, then copy out the
bits you want, then actually run SED against it.

It's not due tomorrow, is it?

Let's make this exercise a bit more "real-world".  Politely ask the
instructor for an example of the submission file.  If he/she doesn't
give you one, make your own that satisfies the criteria given and post
it here.

apologize. There are a total of 16 questions and I've done all but the

Always curious about stuff, I downloaded and burned the live CD. 

It gave me a 640 x 480 display, although the screen settings cheerfully offered to set it up at 1680 x 1050. Unfortunately, doing so did not change the display. It did change what the screen settings window said I had - it said it was 1680 x 1050, but it was really 640 x 480.

It also failed to find my bluetooth mouse and my ethernet. I can forgive them the mouse, as bluetooth is pretty cutting edge. But my ethernet is bog standard.

I wish them all the luck in the world, but they've got a long way to go.

Robert's advice is a good place to start.   If your professor hasn't
provided you with a usable sample file, make one for yourself and
start testing your script with it.  Don't try to write the final
version of the script all at once.  Start by writing something really
simple, like the "read" example your professor gave.  Once it works
like you expect, then go to the next step.  The next step could be,
say, spitting out only the lines that start with the word "sed".  Keep
iterating until your script meets the requirements.  Even if you're
not sure about the whole structure at the outset, start playing with
it and the logic will come to you.

Good luck!

Syllable is in fairly early stages of development.  I think of it as
somewhat equivalent to Linux in the pre-2.0 days.  It probably isn't
the ideal choice if you just want to get things done.  On the other
hand, if you manage to get ethernet working under it, you'll probably
have learned something interesting along the way.  With an OS at this
stage of development, that's probably the best you can hope for, and
kind of the whole point.  By the way, Syllable's AFS file system is
the AtheOS File System, not Andrew File System.

>From what I've read, ReactOS is basically the same as Wine, but
without Unix underneath.  So it isn't likely to run Windows programs
any better than Wine.  I'm not saying this to discourage you from
trying it out, but you should set your expectations accordingly.  If
Wine/ReactOS ever does get to the point of drop-in replacement for
Windows, expect Microsoft to go all out with patent lawsuits on every
obvious and trivial idea they ever copied from anyone else.

Message-ID: <20071211232318.a805f0a9.johnxj@comcast.net>

It's that time of year again. :(

Once again I struggle with Quickbooks. I have it running in Windows
2000 under VirtualBox. It is a pain. OK, accounting itself is a pain.
Accounting came with original sin, I think. If only Adam hadn't eaten
that damn apple. If only the software wasn't annoying as well.

I've been googling for the past several hours. Evidently:

1) GnuCash cannot handle inventory. I installed the latest from
Synaptic (Gutsy, x86_64), which is version 2.2.1, October, 2007). I
searched everywhere, but can't find any buttons for inventory. Is it
true? The highly vaunted GnuCash can't handle inventory? You mean I
have to spend an hour with a clipboard walking all over physically
counting how much of each item I have on the shelf? Tell me it isn't so.

2) It can import data from Quicken, but not Quickbooks. My Quickbooks
native format is .qbw and it can export to .iif, whatever that is. Does
anyone know of any way to get data in Quickbooks format into GnuCash?
Does anyone know what .iif is?

Also, are there any small business alternatives besides GnuCash and
QuickBooks?

   Hope you didn't strain your throat. Gnucash is nice for personal finance
and tries to be applicable to businesses, too. But, there is a large
difference in the needs of each market and software that tries to bridge the
gap is usually much less efficient than those aimed at one market or the
other.

   I strongly recommend SQL-Ledger <http://www.sql-ledger.com/>. While it has
more bells and whistles than many of us need, it includes everything that we
do need. It can appear overwhelming at first because it's designed for
manufacturing->distribution->retailing (including POS), but it's used by a
very broad range of product- and service-providing businesses employing 1 to
many people.

   Inventory is a central feature. I have various services and business
travel expenses as inventory items so I can use them when preparing an
invoice.

   I believe that there are filters for importing QuackBooks data; however,
since I never used any of those Intuit products I really don't know.

Though I wouldn't give as strong a recommendation, I use SQL-Ledger for
my company (16 person software dev/IT services).

Web based is nice as I can give our accountants/tax-people remote access
 and is OS agnostic for the end user.

We are soon going to be using the check printing feature.

A group of people were not happy with the way the project was being run
and forked it into LedgerSMB (http://www.ledgersmb.org/).  I have no
experience with this and looking at the website shows the latest release
dated 5 days ago.

We were originally drawn to it (3 years ago) due to it being one of the
few FOSS accounting packages out there, and it's backend was originally
based on PostgreSQL (which were big fans of).

LedgerSMB is sponsored (?) by Command Prompt Inc.  I talked to Josh 
Drake at the Postgresql Conference last month about LedgerSMB.  The 
community had, interestingly enough, the same concerns that I had years 
ago when I used SQL-Ledger.  These were mostly about the model.  I.e. 
money was stored as floats, no real referential integrity, etc.  The 
change log for LedgerSMB indicates even some logic/coding issues but I 
suspect they are in both SQL-Ledger and LedgerSMB.
    This is not to 'dis' Dieter.  At the time I used SQL-Ledger I had a 
payed support contact and even though I posted questions to the main 
mailing list I usually got replies from Dieter before the post had made 
it back to me.
    That is service.

I suggest you look at both.  Neither are trivial to install.

Sql-ledger is listed in Synaptic, so I installed it to take it for a
quick spin. But I ran into a wall. Since it is web based it did not
install a launch item, and I can't figure out how to start using it. I
suppose I need to create a database, but how do I do that and how do I
access it?

I want to test this, but the ISO download is awful slow, and I can't use
Torrent because of the network configuration.  Any place else I can download
the iso?

Thanks.

   Do you have apache and postgres installed?

   The sql-ledger site has detailed installation instructions. Once
installed, I open a firefox tab and type
                     http://localhost/sql-ledger/login.pl

The other useful script is admin.pl.

Had the same problem with the last posted ISO.  No seeder for the ISO
and the FTP was
so slow that I didn't bother.

Which distro of Linux are you running? Some Linux distros do not install
PostgreSQL. Automatically (e.g., LAMP = Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). It may
be that SQL Ledger requires PostgreSQl rather and MySQL.

Well, in the real world, it would be worth a lot more than 40 points to 
write a bash parser using bash.  I, as a resident of the real world, 
would probably just grep them all into one file, audit that and then 
run them from there.

This isn't exactly what you want, but it's a start.  This command will 
show all installed packages, sorted by install time.

rpm -qa --last

According to section 6.2.1.1 of this document:
http://docs.fedoraproject.org/drafts/rpm-guide-en/ch06s02.html
the following command will show a removal ID if one exists.

rpm -qa --qf "%-20{NAME} %-20{REMOVETID}\n"

I'm not sure whether to trust this.  I'm not seeing any removed 
packages on my system, which I don't believe is correct.  In fact, it 
looks as if the database that would contain this 
info(/var/lib/rpm/Removetid) does not exist on my Centos 4.5 system.

You can't tell when rpm was last run.  But you can tell when the
latest package was installed. rpm has a --qf flag that allows setting
the query format.  One of tags is INSTALLTIME.  I think there is even
a way to format it as a date.

rpm -qa --qf '%{NAME} %{INSTALLTIME} %{INSTALLTIME:date}\n' | sort -n -k2

This won't tell you who did the install.  You will have to check login
or sudo logs for that.

Yum also keeps a log of package changes it made in /var/log/yum.log.

ls -lt --time=atime /var/lib/rpm

Unless, of course, your filesystem is mounted with the oft-recommended 
noatime option.

As Paul mentioned, if your filesystem is mounted with 'noatime' (they
aren't by default), you can examine the last access time of /bin/rpm:

$ ls -lu /bin/rpm 

If that only gives you the date (maybe it's today), you can use 'stat'
to view the contents of the inode, including the access time with
seconds. That's the last time it was _accessed_, but is most likely the
time the command was run. Of course, if you've been running it...

Depending on which version and how recent, you might also have logs
in /var/log/rpmpkgs*.

It's also possible that yum is being used, in which case you can grep
for 'yum' in /var/log/messages*

I'm unsure if you're actually interested in knowing when someone runs 
the rpm binary or not. The Red Hat packaging system can be accessed 
via some shared libraries, so keeping an eye on /bin/rpm won't 
necessarily be an accurate way of knowing when there's been rpm-like 
activity.

It'd probably be more useful to keep an eye on the /var/lib/rpm 
directory or one or more of the database files it contains.

If you have SELinux installed and configured, you can have the audit 
daemon keep an eye on certain files. See /usr/share/doc/audit-* and 
the sample rules files there for information on monitoring a certain 
file or directory.

I started the torrent about 10 minutes ago and the download speed is
now hovering between 30 and 90 KB/s. Ktorrent says 15 hours remaining.
I'll just leave it running until it finishes. Then I'll burn a couple
of DVDs to take to the next Clinic. I'd e-mail it but my e-mail (even
from home) goes through PSU. A 1.9 GB file would probably make the PSU

Make sure you are downloading 0.0.1.1 not 0.0.1.0.

Well first of all I would like to thank everyone for their support with Ultumix. Your ideas, complaints, and comments really help. The whole idea is to make the distro what you and Windows Users want it to be. 

I ran into a bit of a snag with version 0.0.1.1 where it would not install on newer laptops and PCs. So I installed version 0.0.0.4 on VMware and first removed wine-doors and updated the kernel to 2.6.22.10.tex1 i686 32 bit linux kernel (4GB). Now I'm upgrading the entire system and adding packages. It will take over 2 hours. Once I get that done I will have to add the start menu, boot splash, and maybe someone can help me with the GRUB and Log In Screen. 

Check the forums for the rest of the info at our home page www.mindblowingidea.com/Ultumix. 

Some people have been complaining that I haven't listed the packages, kernel, and xorg so I have started doing this and I am asking for help because I don't have the time now.

I didn't have postres installed, but after installing it, I still get a
page loading error on the above. As for apache, I have apache2,
apache2.2-common, apache2-mpm-worker and apache2-utils installed. There
are about a dozen more listed in Synaptic. Which ones do I need?

> The other useful script is admin.pl.

I also went to the ledger-sql website, but couldn't make heads or tails
of the installation instructions. Evidently there is a setup script,
but I couldn't figure out how to get it. Also, if ledger-sql is listed
in Synaptic, the package is brain-dead for failing to install
everything necessary to use it.

Now, of course, I really want to try it. If it's this hard to install
and set up it must be seriously awesome.

This is not a sure-fire method, but you could check root's ~/.bash_history
file (or the equivalent for other shells).

If they're using rpm via yum then it would show up in /var/log/yum.log.

ReactOS is an operating system, albeit a very buggy one.  ReactOS is
being designed to use native Windows 2000 and later hardware drivers.
I don't think this is possible with wine.  I doubt that ReactOS will
get sued successfully barring a change in patent law to cover software,
go to http://www.reactos.org to find out more.  Wine hasn't been sued
where the ReactOS project is employing the same development model.

Hey thanks. What's Your SF.net ID? I need to keep you listed so that when a new version comes out I can notify you.

Umm well Crossover Linux costs money and Wine is free. Plus the new Wine will let you do cool things. I think I will install Direct X in wine in the new version but I first need to know if it's legal. I have a whole list of programs to install in wine in the owner account like Firefox to make programs work better.

I went to their web site and looked at the compatibiity database. I saw
practically no apps that actually work under ReactOS. They have a very
long way to go.

Aha! I did not think of that. Indeed, I do have Comcast. And as far as
I know, they are still playing dirty pool with torrents. After 7.5
hours my average is 22.5 KB/s. 

Maybe it's time to look into DSL.

Don't go with Qwest (As the ISP). I was visiting my parents over the weekend
and until I shutdown my torrents they kept disconnecting me. Maybe go with
one of the local places like Hevanet. Call and see if they do any bandwidth
throttling or traffic shaping.

I've been using cron to run my X-10 lighting controls for several
months. Yesterday I added two lamp modules to control Christmas
decoration lights. I also changed my crontab entries to reflect the
lighting change. The lights operated as expected yesterday. This morning
they don't.

It seems that something has gone wrong with the x10 program, or
something related to it. Any ideas on where to start looking?

When I run the x10 program directly from the command line "nothing"
happens for a minute or more, and then the command prompt returns with a
message about mail. The mail message is:

I keep wondering if it is just the settings I have in Ktorrent that are
the source of the problem, rather than Comcast. For example, all my
other internet activity is not slower. If they were throttling someone
using torrents, would that not affect all my traffic?

I also just noticed in Ktorrent that there is a dropdown for "engine,"
which lists bitoogle.com, bittorrent.com, bytenova.org,
isotottents.com, Ktorrents, and mininova.org. It is set to the
bitoogle.com by default, as I never even knew this dropdown list was
there. It might have been added during a recent upgrade. I wonder what
those things do.

Is it all the lights or just the new ones? Did you perhaps bump off
either end of the wireless controller? I'm guessing you have the
wireless outlet controller and the wireless serial port transmitter?

What does the 'x10 checksum error' below mean?

Where is your x10 program from?

They're search engines, for searching for torrents. They have no effect
on your bandwith. Part of the problem is probably that cable modems are
highly asymmetric--back when I followed these things more closely, their
upstream bandwidth was on the order of 128kbps. BitTorrent is designed
to favor users who share more, so your limited upstream bandwidth
hurts. 

Another suggestion, albeit counter-intuitive, is to cap your upstream
bandwidth to 80%. Part of the communications process with TCP requires
sending acknowledgement packets to the sender. If these are getting
dropped or delayed due to congestion, then the sender will re-transmit,
which also hurts your performance.

Finally, you also need to set up port forwarding (assuming you're using
a firewall) for the upstream to work at all, which causes a worse
penalty than having limited upstream bandwidth. Of course, you will also
need to ensure that the port is opened on your host, if you have
firewall rules there also.

There are numerous FAQs out there about BitTorrent which you should
probably read if you're having problem.

Try resetting or power-cycling the X10 controller. If it has
battery backup you might have to pull the battery for a few seconds.

Also make sure the controller is not overheating. I once set my
old CP-290 controller on top of a modem. The little bit of extra
heat pushed it over the edge. But once it cooled off it's been
fine ever since, and that was seven years ago or more.

No. Traffic shaping can be done by classifying packets based on port 
or protocol number(s) or even deeper packet inspection. E-mail zips 
along while your torrents crawl.

Hevanet is good. I doubt if they do any such evil.

I use Aracnet/Spiritone (over Qwest DSL lines).  I have no problem with
torrents.  (Or any other sort of filtering.)

The fancier X10 controllers have checksums built in to the
serial protocol. The software is saying that things are not
adding up, literally.

This can be caused by several things:
1. The controller itself is misbehaving.
2. Serial communications between the PC and the controller are
   out-of-sync for some reason.
3. The serial port is misconfigured.

Given that it worked recently I'm assuming #1 or #2. Resetting
the controller should clear it up, I hope.

The lights and their associated wall plug-ins are OK, and work from the
BSR X10 control boxes (I have two of those). The problem is on my Linux box.

Actually, that's my question. How do I figure out what that means?

> Where is your x10 program from?

Good question. I downloaded it some years ago, but I don't recall from
where. Here's the first line of the README file:

This version of Larry Campbell's x10 program has been modified to
support module aliases, and sunrise and sunset calculations.

I power cycled the CP-290 (no battery) but that didn't help.

My CP-290 is sitting on top of my Linux box, under my desk. It does not
feel warm to the touch.

Now, when I try to run the X10 program from the command line, it does
"nothing" until I hit <ctrl-C>.

Just guessing here, but perhaps you've got multiple instances of the 
X10 program running.  They could be fighting over serial port access.

Comcast is the first major company to limit torrent download speeds to fight against piracy. Look on ZDnet. They are trying to restrict the internet. Anyway try azureus instead of ktorrent or if you are a windows user try uTorrent.

Don't go with Qwest (As the ISP). I was visiting my parents over the weekend
and until I shutdown my torrents they kept disconnecting me. Maybe go with
one of the local places like Hevanet. Call and see if they do any bandwidth
throttling or traffic shaping.

I tried Azureus some time ago. It wasn't very stable on Feisty x86_64.
It might be better on Gutsy, but I'd rather stick with Ktorrent. That
is, unless the download speed is related to something in Ktorrent,

Ktorrent does not have the same ability to see leachers and seeders. I used Ktorrent but it never saw all the peers.

I tried Azureus some time ago. It wasn't very stable on Feisty x86_64.
It might be better on Gutsy, but I'd rather stick with Ktorrent. That
is, unless the download speed is related to something in Ktorrent,
which at this point I doubt.

A firmware update on the modem will also fix this.  If you have a Cisco
firewall/router you may need to do this as well.

The problem may not be filtering.  it may be that the connection table used
by the router is too small.

Also, you may need to use Windows and IE to update the firmware.  The Cisco
update uses an ActiveX control to do most of the work.  It fails
mysteriously with Firefox or any other OS.

There has been a big pissing match over binary kernel blobs v.s. binary
firmware blobs.  Some people do not see the difference.  Some claim that
there is a difference.

It is my understanding that the FCC is resisting allowing open sourced
drivers because people would be able to modify the output power of the
radios.  (Not that closed source is a barrier given the right disassembler.)

The biggest problem right now is that there is not one clear interface for
wireless drivers in the kernel.  There is that way the kernel developers do
it, there is the Madwifi people and the hostap interface.  These need to be
combined into one before things will get any better.

There is a difference.  Binary firmware blobs run on the wireless
device and can possibly not work.  Binary kernel blobs run on your CPU
and can panic your box.

The FCC rule requires hardware vendors to try to prevent end-users to
exceed mandated limits, which has been interpretted as prohibiting
their (the vendors) release of open source drivers.  Some devices,
software defined radios, are particularly impacted by this, Atheros
radios being an example.  My understanding is that the FCC rule is not
binding on people other than radio hardware vendors creating
open-source drivers.  So, open-source driver hackers are having to
figure a lot of stuff out on their own, which naturally slows things
down.

There *is* one clear interface direction these days, and that's
mac80211.  Everything else is legacy.  Madwifi folks have said that
their development effort is being directed mostly towards the ath5k
(mac80211 stack) driver these days.  The problem is that mac80211
isn't quite ready for prime time, nor are many of the drivers that use
it.

I give up. I can't get it installed. Something is missing and
http://localhost/sql-ledger/login.pl just gives me an error message.
I've installed everything that the web site says to install, but it
won't work. It would help if I had half an idea what any of these
things are -- apache, postgres and all the other things are unknown to
me.

Meantime, I stumbled across Quasar:

http://linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reviews/5692/2/

It seems to have had no further work done on it since 2005. But what is
there looks good. Has anyone tried it? 

Is there anything else out there that can do invoicing with automatic
item insertion from an inventory product list?

I have dealt with SQL Ledger just a bit, but it was a while ago.
First, I would suggest uninstall the Synaptic package from your distro, and
install everything from the tar.gz or whatever they use on the SQL Ledger
website.
I have a feeling something in the package is missing, or a requirement, or
some such.  Try from "scratch".  This will be more likely to give you the
installer script, and this will more likely put everything in the right
place.
Apache and PostgresSQL should be able to install those from your distro
packages and use with it.  You also want to be sure you have Perl installed,
and any Perl modules called for by sql-ledger docs, I am guessing
PostgresSQL has a module, maybe some Apache modules, etc.
When I dealt with SQL Ledger it was on RedHat 8 or 9.

Have you tried asking the people at sql-ledger.com for assistance?

At 8:45 am I was at 99.74%, so by the time you read this I will have
it. I'll continue seeding for a while, even though my share ratio is
1.5.

This mirror is faster and more stable but it's still slow. The best way to get a copy is still via the torrent.

Ok cool I don't know where to tell you to upload it and frankly I don't care. Just put it at aurl/Ultumix/ with the readme files and torrent and send me the link. I will put it on my site. Thanks again

The same problem was there this morning and easily fixed by killing the
X10 process. But, why did it need to be fixed?

It occurs to me that it might be the way I have two shell scripts that
control X10 modules called at the same time of day. Does cron just
launch a program based on time of day, and not notice that it just did
that a microsecond ago?

I have a normal shell script to shut down a couple of lights at 23:59
every night. I have a second shell script to shut down the Christmas
decoration lights, and I scheduled it for the same time. Is this the
likely culprit? By simply scheduling it a couple of minutes apart,
should that solve the problem? I'm trying that tonight. I'll know in the
morning if it works.

I'm not certain how cron determines which program to run first if
there are multiple programs scheduled to happen at the same time, but
I would assume it either just runs them sequentially, or forks a
process for each one (probably the later). In any case, I put together
a simple test:

Two scripts (I could have used parameters, but I didn't want to
complicate things with command line args in crontab):

test_a.sh:
-----------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

date +%H:%M:%S:%N > /tmp/a
sleep 5
date +%H:%M:%S:%N >> /tmp/a
------------------------------------

test_b.sh:
-----------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

date +%H:%M:%S:%N > /tmp/b
sleep 5
date +%H:%M:%S:%N >> /tmp/b
------------------------------------

The scripts just write their start and exit times to a file, and sleep
for 5 seconds in between, so there is plenty of opportunity for a
context switch in the middle.

I then set up my crontab as follows:

20 16 * * * /home/rcreswick/tmp/test_a.sh
20 16 * * * /home/rcreswick/tmp/test_b.sh

and I waited for things to go off.  If the apps are run sequentially,
then the first timestamp in /tmp/b will be after the first timestamp
in test_a. If the scripts are run concurrently, then the times will be
interwoven:

$ cat /tmp/a
16:20:01:498972285
16:20:06:503618939

$ cat /tmp/b
16:20:01:507666246
16:20:06:512344760

So, knowing that the commands are running concurrently, then yes, if
they interfere with each other, then we would have to take that into
account through some external locking.

One approach to your problem would be to have a single
manipulate_my_lights.sh script that's run by cron, and then have that
script read a specification of what to do when it is executed.  (Turn
off the house lights, turn off the tree lights, etc..)  Then you would
just have to modify that specification.  This could be as simple as
just a wrapper around the commands you now have in cron:

#!/bin/bash
<first command from crontab>
<second command from crontab>

You could instead estimate how long the first command will take and
space them out, but this would be more reliable, and easier to work
with in the future.

Subject: [PLUG] Memory leak???
Message-ID: <20071214232551.3v2nz05f9cs4ksko@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

On a CentOS 4.3 box yum  updated to 4.4 I have been watching the free store
via top and have been noticing it going down throughout the day.  I've had
to shut this box off the hard way a couple of times because it was thrashing.
Question is, what's the culprit?

NFS

Apache 2

PHP

Perl

vsftpd

Spamassassin

Postfix

Bind 9

kernel 2.6.9-42.0.8.plus.c4 #1 Wed Jan 31 09:13:16 EST 2007 i686 i686  
i386 GNU/Linux

Why isn't the swap space being used?

Is there a way to do garbage collection or otherwise get the memory back
before the system starts to thrash?

How much do the 36 loop devices cost?  I followed the CD-Server HOWTO.

The box is maxed out at 512 megs of ram.

I'd hate to use cron to force a reboot every night.

You can find out by sorting the top output by memory -- press "M" in
top.  Are you using Firefox on that box?

If it's thrashing, then it is using swap.

Kill the process that's using the memory and the kernel should take
care of the rest.

Message-ID: <165DBD80-E5F9-42E9-ABB5-16DFFD9EF1C0@madebyai.com>

Hey all,

Just got Gentoo installed on a shiny new Dell PowerEdge 2950 server  
with an LSI Logic MegaRAID SAS RAID controller. Everything is great  
except this:

[   81.028864] sd 0:2:0:0: [sda] 1951399936 512-byte hardware sectors  
(999117 MB)
[   81.028991] sd 0:2:0:0: [sda] Write Protect is off
[   81.029059] sd 0:2:0:0: [sda] Mode Sense: 1f 00 10 08
[   81.029121] sd 0:2:0:0: [sda] Write cache: disabled, read cache:  
disabled, supports DPO and FUA

As the kernel reports, both write- and read-caching are disabled. This  
is grossly obvious during file copies of a few GB or more - the entire  
system grinds to a halt for 5+ minutes per GB. Even the console is  
unresponsive.

Unless I'm mistaken and there is some other cause for these symptoms,  
I need to figure out how to enable write caching. On the controller  
itself write caching is configured to WriteBack, but I don't know if  
the megaraid_sas driver is bypassing this, or what's going on. I've  
tried the usual google queries and come up empty-handed. Does anyone  
have any suggestions?

Thanks!
-Aaron

That appears to be the way things work. The two scripts I was calling do
indeed have two calls to X10 each, so within a given script, it's not a
problem. The problem exists when there are two scripts that both call
X10. That's when the second one (I presume) hangs waiting for the first
one to finish. Of course, once it's hung, it never sees the other one
finish. I suppose that if I had the time I could learn something about C
programming by studying the code that talks to the serial port and put
in a test to see if some other process is using the port, and if so wait
a short time before trying again. However, the correct solution is, as
you recommend, putting all the calls to X10 in a single script. The
lights operated correctly this morning. Yesterday I separated the two
crontab entries by 10 minutes. It probably would have worked if they
were separated by 1 minute, too. I notice that the CP-290 does take a
few seconds to respond to the command from X10.

Thanks for the analysis.

Alternatively:

*  Include in your script something like:

    while ps ax | grep -q  [x]10
    do
       # wait for other x10 process to complete
       sleep 10
    done

Then you can do X10 stuff without asking yourself "do I have a cron job about
to do something?"


*  have the script read a list of devices to affect

   for light in `cat listoflights`
   do
        x10 _params_ $light
   done

Thanks! I haven't had occasion to do many shell scripts. These are good

One usually disables write-caching with RAID.  It makes it much less
likely that you'll end up with an inconsistent RAID volume if there's a
power-cut.  

That said, the little caches on the drives won't help you much, anyway.
Depending on what technique is used for the copying, you're running into
a problem with some implementations of the block caching, readahead
and/or scheduler systems.  Basically, it tries to read as many files
as it can into RAM, then swaps madly, while writing files out, while
it's trying to read more, and trips over its own feet.  I don't know
what kernel config ad optimizations you're using in Gentoo, but poor
choices there could make it worse.

The cp command, I understand, does things in little chunks to prevent
this.

Thanks. As soon as I get home I'll Put It UP. By the way I'm getting pumbled by the people in the Linux community that want me to provide the source code. I'm tired of the complaints so I just want to get the source code but PCLinuxOS won't provide it to me. If anyone can get it and upload it to one of these servers I would appreciate it. Keep in mind I'm banned from their site.

Mirror is up

http://ultumix.youmakemefeelinadequate.com

I am running Round Robin DNS on 2 mirrors, 1 based in PDX, the other based
in San Diego CA.

If anyone has trouble please let me know.

Cheers,

First, let's change the question.

What is the problem?

Is the load going up? Is daemon response measurably slower? Are
processes dropping core dumps?

> Why isn't the swap space being used?

Because the system hasn't run out of RAM.

Free memory can show as little as 5M. That doesn't mean the system is in
a low-memory state.

Define (and describe) 'thrash'. As Rogan said, if there's no swap usage,
there can be no thrashing.

The linux kernel is better at memory management than you'd think. It won't
reclaim memory until another program needs it, for the most part. "Free"
memory is a bit if a misleading term, you'll want to identify how much your
processes are using, not what 'top' says is free, since the two are pretty
different.
Thrashing could occur for any number of reasons as well, you listed quite a
few services running on that system, as well as mentioned it being a CD
server. Chances are, any 'thrashing' thats occuring is just normal disk
access loading up program data.
Hard drive activity is normal  :)
I've got a couple dev boxes with umpteen gigs of RAM, and still theres
massive disk access to program data, databases, etc.

They don't host their source code themselves, but have links to other places
that do. Here's one where they'll send you a DVD for $7.98:
http://on-disk.com/index.php/cPath/28_156

And here's where you can just download whichever files you need or want:

http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/texstar/pclinuxos/apt/pclinuxos/2007/

Either way, you don't need to visit their site at all for them.

I thought I might try to download the source for you, but I can't find it on their site. Do you know what the filename is?

Don't worry. I have the link. A secret undercover agent in the PCLinuxOS contacts got it for me. :) A double agent. http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/texstar/pclinuxos/apt/pclinuxos/2007/

I have 130 GBs on a removable hard drive free and I'm downloading to it now. I will try to compress the 2007 file down and put it on my server if it will fit. I may need someone to help me out by buying me another external drive. I don't know. It's a shame people can't just use this link instead.

Message-ID: <47648F1A.7020609@cad2cam.com>

Sitting here minding my own business and just trying to print to my 
All-in-One HP 3150 from my Fedora Core 7 Pentium 4 system, I hear a 
mournful beep from the printer and my system shuts down.  Now when I 
boot it up, it does not find the PATA drive, again.  Just like the last 
kernel problem.  Googling just gives me the run around.  I fixed it last 
tim by back reving the kernel.  I guess I can do that again, but this is 
getting to be PITA.

Here's a uname -a:
Linux system.com 2.6.23.8-34.fc7 #1 SMP Thu Nov 22 23:05:33 EST 2007 
i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux


What kernel module(s) do I need to load to get the sdb devices created 
from the PATA drive?  I already have a scsi drive and thus have the scsi 
modules loaded.  Here's my lsmod listing:

flash device in the HP printers your system could be trying to boot from the
flash drive, which will fail.  If you disconnect the printer and reboot it
will not try to boot from the CF card, etc. Although I'm not sure if you
have a similar situation...so this may not help..but just my initial
thoughts.

Good luck!

Thanks, Aaron,

That is one of the first things I tried.  I just did it again.  I must 
be crazy, because I did the same thing and expected different results.  
There is an error generated just after the nash shell starts:

usb 1-1: device not accepting address 2, error -62.

Don't think this is the problem.  But it is an added point of data.  I 
have felt the drive.  It is hot and feels like it is spinning.  It still 
might have been a head crash, but I can hope, that it is the same 
problem I had with the previous kernel.  That kernel did not detect the 
Serial ATA drive either.  See plug email dated 11/21/2007 07:40 AM.

Ken,

Boot a Knoppix or Ubuntu live CD.
You will be able to tell if you have a crashed drive quickly that way.

Thanks, Aaron,

That is one of the first things I tried.  I just did it again.  I must be
crazy, because I did the same thing and expected different results.  
There is an error generated just after the nash shell starts:

usb 1-1: device not accepting address 2, error -62.

Don't think this is the problem.  But it is an added point of data.  I have
felt the drive.  It is hot and feels like it is spinning.  It still might
have been a head crash, but I can hope, that it is the same problem I had
with the previous kernel.  That kernel did not detect the Serial ATA drive
either.  See plug email dated 11/21/2007 07:40 AM.

There was a problem with the ISO yesterday. Thanks to John  Jason I've got a

Thanks, Bill. good suggestion.  I went to bed last night instead.  This 
morning I tried the Knoppix and still no drive.  So I did what I did  
one time this happened, I openned the case and pulled the drive.  The 
cables were slightly ajar, maybe happened when I removed the drive, but 
I put them back on and reinstalled the drive in the box.  Booted. The 
drive is back.

Linux is great, but sometimes even it can;t get through cables that come 
off.

I did chase the gremlin out of the box, I hope.

my publicly displayed user name is the same as my user name worldwidelab. I haven't heard any problems about the 2nd mirror. I haven't used it. I will foward your complaint to the PLUG. Portland Oregon Linux Users Group. One of their members put up the mirror. Anyway you will probably have more luck with the torrent then. Use Azureus. Also check the site again www.mindblowingidea.com/Ultumix I have added a new video. I hope you like it. My bandwidth is running out again from all the page hits so it may be momentarily unavailable after a while. Hopefully it will stay up tell the end of the month.

I'm trying to set up a postgresql database.  Question 1 is, can I use 1

Is sqlgrey a daemon that calls the database?

I have not used sqlgrey, nor am I a postgresql expert, so my comments 
are general in nature.
You can use the same server for two different databases serving two 
different sqlgrey implementations.
Since Sqlgrey is written Perl with DBI connectors, there should be a 
config file for sqlgrey to tell it where the server is and the database 
name, or you can just hack the source.

I haven't used mambo in production, but in my research for easy to 
implement CMS's, Joomla pops out of the top of the list along with 
Drupal, and Wordpress.  Joomla is a fork of Mambo.  Have you looked at 
cmsmatrix.org for comparisons and reference sites?

Speaker: John Ronciak <john.ronciak at intel.com>
Topic: Intel and Linux kernel driver development

The LAN Access Division at Intel is responsible for 6 in-kernel upstream
drivers, e100, e1000, ixgb, e1000e, igb, ixgbe and ioatdma.  These
driver require maintenance to keep up with the ever evolving Linux
kernel so we need to keep pushing changes upstream as well.  This work
involves having to blend the Open Source Linux community way of working
with corporate and business mechanisms.  This presentation and
discussion is about how we make that happen as well as how we interact
with the Linux community.

I think the Joomla people would claim that Mambo is a fork of Mambo, and
Joomla is simply a renaming of Mambo.  As I understand, although mambo was
an open source project, the name was owned (as a trademark) by a private
company that was promoting the development of Mambo.  At some point,
there was a disagreement between the Mambo community and the company
that owned the name, which resulted in the two going in separate directions.
The company kept the name and maybe a little bit of the community for their
version.  The rest of the community started developing using the name Joolma.

I don't know how accurate this story is.  It was told to me by a couple
Joolma developers, who were probably somewhat biased.

Joolma is a very popular CMS.  I haven't ever used it, but I have looked
at it and it looks very nice to me.  Joolma uses standard things like
php and mySQL and apache; so it should be fairly easy to setup and
use with most web hosting services.

Message-ID: <4766294C.2010504@alcpress.com>

I've had my head down programming for the past several
weeks so I haven't been paying attention. Someone recently
suggested that Windows now has the equivalent of UNIX/Linux
symbolic links in (one of) its filesystems. He didn't have
any details.

I'm aware of NTFS junction points, which I don't consider
to have the functionality of symbolic links. Has anything
else been introduced that has symbolic links functionality?

Windows Vista and later has the feature, it appears to be more similar 
to "real" symbolic links than junction points are: "Symbolic links are 
designed to aid in migration and application compatibility with UNIX 
operating systems. Microsoft has implemented its symbolic links to 
function just like UNIX links."

Thanks for the reply. The server is UPS-backed and the RAID controller  
has it's own battery backup unit. I don't do anything special with the  
kernel, I just like Gentoo's package management. I've tried the copy  
with both cp and rsync, in both cases the servers console becomes  
unusable. I've never seen this before - I have several systems running  
with 3ware raid controllers that respond just fine under heavy disk  
utilization. The kernel also doesn't say write caching is disabled on  
those boxes.

I think what's happening is the kernel isn't buffering writes to the  
RAID controller - irrespective of whether the RAID controller is  
disabling it's own write cache or the caches on each disk.

Install the LSI Linux raid management software, and you can then view/set
the options your kernel is using.

Thanks, Brent. It seems like NTFS symbolic links have existed
for a while. None of the documentation I've read today tells
me whether Windows Vista ships with either a command line program
or a GUI tool to create symbolic links. I don't have Vista. Do
you know?

I don't know as I've never even seen a Vista machine but the wikipedia

distributed with Vista

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0712171656220.4108@shadow>

Hi!

So I'm looking for some kind of low cost, low power fileserver.  I think 
either it should be in the $200 range and support two IDE drives (yeah, 
that's the power problem, isn't it?) or should be under $100 and support 
USB 2.0 (for external drive enclosures).

Right now, it looks like the very best bet is the Linksys NSLU2 NAS 
device. Since it runs Linux, the source has been released and, from that, 
other distributions have been reverse-engineered onto the platform.  See:

<URL: http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/Main/HomePage >

This device is about $80.

This would require, however, a good external drive enclosure.  I imagine 
something that holds 4 disks would be ideal.  These can be found for about 
$130 without rails for 3.5" hard disks.  So let's call it $150.

So I'm seeing a low power linux box for $230 that supports four hard 
disks.

Can anyone suggest something that would beat that?

I think all I really need is SAMBA and FTP, but the full Debian 
capabability of the NSLU2 makes me think I could run a torrent client, 
Household Wiki, or something else mildly useful.

So what is the deciding factor, cost or power?
I would recommend Dlink DNS-323.  A little more up scale than what you
are asking
about but certainly worth a look.

There's a tipping point for both, naturally.

I won't go for a full PC option for power concerns (though for price, 
surely that's the way to go).

I simply can't spend more than around $300.

I looked at this first, actually.

It's not expandable at all.  I feel a bit like it's a dead-end solution. 
I suppose I should have included life-cycle and waste-time in my criteria.

I think it's pretty straightforward to put up to four four-bay enclosures 
on the NSLU2 (though that would be insane).  Also, I have a pair of 300GB 
IDE drives and the DNS-323 only takes SATA.

One of these might work:
http://wdlsystems.com/ebox/ebox.shtml

The 2300SX is $90 and has 3x USB 2.0.  I'm going to replace my aging
full size firewall with one of these and a pair of USB drives (or
possibly compact flash/usb flash drives).

I'm pretty sure they'll handle a full OS install with no hacking.  We're
soon going to be using 60 of them as thin clients for a edubuntu LTSP
lab at a high school.

That appears to not include a power supply -- add $10.

It only lists one ethernet.  How are you goinng to use it as a firewall? 
USB ethernet?

These look pretty good.  I'm a little curious what the install procedure 
would be like having only a CF.  Would I have to make a bootable flash 
card and go from there?  Would I have to set up some kind of TFTP boot 
server?

In essence, it's not much different from what I want to do with the NSLU2 
-- boot from a flash memory device and load it up with USB2.0 disk 
enclosures.  The price is just a little higher, but the performance should 
be a lot better (assuming I can get past the install).

hmm.

802.1q trunking is worth the cost savings of having to get a 2-eth
version (say, the 3852, which is $250).

When I installed Debian 4.0 on a 3853, I used a USB cdrom drive and the
compact flash disk was detected as a regular disk (I can't remember if
SCSI or IDE).  Installed like a normal HD, no issues.

Have you checked the current draw of a new, good, mid-power atx supply 
vs the collection of wall-warts that will be involved in powering the 
external usb enclosure(s)?

With a slower cpu, but a new (micro atx?) motherboard, your drives are 
probably going to consume more power than the PC.  Putting everything 
on one large power supply is likely to be more efficient -- it may 
hardly notice the presence of cpu+mobo in comparison to the drives.

So, get a random PIII computer from Free Geek, then buy the most 
efficient, cool-running drives and power-supply you can afford?

Subject: [PLUG] FCC ID lookup
Message-ID: <86ejdkv7yu.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


Alan was asking about a wireless access point at Paddy's this evening
after the advanced topics talk.  Turns out it was a Netgear WNR834M, a
sexy looking device except that it doesn't have visible antennas.
Wanting to know more about it, I thought I'd show him the FCC (like
GCC but completely different) website where you can find out stuff
about radiating devices using the FCC ID as a lookup key.

The website is here: 

  <https://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/GenericSearch.cfm>

All wireless cards and access points (and lots of other stuff too)
will be labelled on the outside with an FCC ID.  In the case of
Paddy's gear, it was: PY306100038

On the generic search form, you type the first three characters into
the 'Grantee Code' field, and the remaining characters into the
'Product Code' field and the click the 'Start Search' button.  That
will return one or more hits.  In our case, we get one.  Click on
"Detail" in the "Display Exhibits" column, which will result in a list
(for this device) of 12 exhibits, pdf files containing information
filed by the applicant.  Typically, the most interesting will be
"Internal Photos" and "Test Report", but any of the exhibits could
yield interesting information.

For another example, to see the insides of the MetroFi gear, take a
peak at FCC-ID: RV7-DBE1010.

I have a bunch of Free Geek computers. Actually I could build my $300.00 PC on my website for only $200.00 and it would kick but. The problem is I need the money to build it. Well maybe after Tex gets a small cut of my first months donations from Ultumix I can still afford it? http://www.mypclinuxos.com/forum/index.php?action=notify;topic=1513.0

   I use Northwest Battery Supply on SE Belmont (right, Galen?) and 37th Ave.
If they don't have the right one they can order it.

   Until they die.

I recently got sealed lead-acid batteries from BatteriesPlus and
Battery Xchange or something.  Figure out what size you need and call
around.  Battery Xchange (SE 20th & Belmont) misquoted the price on
one of them and I got it at a substantial discount.  Thank you, crappy
database applications!

I got replacements at a battery store on Canyon Rd. in Beaverton. I forget
the exact name. It's not too far West of Hwy 217 on the right. I'm sure
there are similar battery stores elsewhere in the Portland Metro area.

Not that I'd particularly recommend Qwest.net over a good local ISP, but I
haven't had any issues with torrents (up or down), nor have I read anything
about Qwest monkeying with bittorrent traffic.  Comcast issues are
well-known and much discussed.

Message-ID: <20071219183936.qkx491rrc0gssg0w@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Anyone else find PSU's computer science program next to impossible to get
through?  If the physics and Calculus don't stop ya, it seems that Karla
Fant will.  Programming Systems is called an intro course, but there's
nothing intro about it.

I've run into difficulties with the academic policy.  Specifically,
the academic warning policy.  PSU is in the dark ages when it comes
to students dropping courses on time.  You go on warning if you
cut your credit load in half.  PCC, last I checked, doesn't worry
about credit load.  I dropped programming systems this fall, one
of 2 courses I was signed up for.  I dropped it before it even
started because the online format wasn't going to make the vague
assignments any easier.  Write a pseudo real estate program is
pretty out there for instructions.  Asking students to do this
on their own in 2 weeks time seems downright absurd to me.

The advice from the IT world, I have a friend there, is to get a
different degree and forget about computer science because I won't
learn what I need to know anyways.  With 28 PSU credits so far and
a few withdrawals, I'm worried about how long it will take to get
off of warning regardless of how I do in future coursework.  My
overall gpa is above a 2.0, but I guess that's being ignored.  I
can't help but wonder if missing grade had anything to do with that.

It is a 200 series course and it has some pre-reqs listed.
The Oregon curiculum on Computer Science has gone back and forth.  The
basic stuff
was being taught in C/C++ and around 2000 was being swapped over
to Java.

It looks like it has swapped back.  I know several people that have
gotten there degrees
there but that was before 2000.  I helped a few of these get through
the upper level
courses.

I had to do a video rental app for one of my assignment at 260 level and do it
with Ansi C.  No C++ extensions.  All the student going straight through were
being pressed hard to learn new stuff.

If the IT person is in Admin stuff then you are right but not
everything is straight
Admin.  The dual major CS/EE or the Computer Engineering gets heavier
into Science
stuff.

There is a lot of math and applied math that is needed for CS.  When
you get a degree
in CS, you should be balanced such that you can do just about any type of app.
Assembly up to multi-language-multi-tier client server stuff.  You
might not be very
good at it but the degree says that you have been exposed to all of it.

If you are having trouble with physics and calculus, then maybe the CS
program and
the associated job market is not for you.

I know nothing of the computer science program, but I have some of the
same issues in linguistics. At least I have managed a perfect 4.0 so
far, but only because I completely discarded the idea of getting a
degree from PSU. I am just taking what I want, so I'm free to take what
interests me and throw out the rest. Mind you, I have 2/3 of the
credits necessary for a masters degree from most any other institution,
but the degree requirements in linguistics at PSU make no sense for my
interests. It's all geared to people wanting to go abroad and teach
English to foreigners, which I have no interest in.

I have discussed this at some length with various professors and even
the department chair. Part of the problem is that PSU is under the
thumbs of the Oregon University System. So are the other universities
in the system -- OSU, UO, SO, etc. But the other universities were
there first, and they have greater clout at the state level, in spite
of the fact that PSU is bigger than any of them (which they resent). In
my case, UO offers the degrees that I want, so the Oregon University
System won't allow PSU to offer the same degree. It would be just
terrible if there was duplication, don't you see? 

Humans are by nature competitive. In the world of business competition
is all about making more profit. Universities aren't supposed to be
about profit, so the competition is toward prestige in other areas.
Just as in business, your prestige increases over the competition by
doing a better job, but it also increases over your competition by
killing them off. Thus the other universities in the system constantly
try to keep PSU from gaining more programs or expanding the ones they
have.

There are other issues as well. Universities must maintain
certification from <I forgot the name of the independent organization>.
The certification requirements are arcane, ridiculous and obsolete, but
PSU must still follow them. (E.g., you cannot maintain certification
unless you have a library with a minimum of 100,000 physical volumes.)
Without accreditation no other university would accept PSU credits for
transfers, and wouldn't even recognize degrees. In the case of the
Department of Applied Linguistics accreditation reqjuirements mean we
cannot offer a doctoral program until we have at least six full
professors. We have five, and OUS won't grant us permission to hire
another one. I state that not because it has anything to do with
computer science, but just to point out that there are literally
volumes of accreditation requirements that PSU has no control over.

I agree with your friend's suggestion that you consider just discarding
the degree and doing what you want. In the world of computer science
this might not limit employment opportunities as much as it would in
other fields. I'd also strongly consider your friend's suggestion to
get a different degree. I'd also suggest that you camp out in your
advisor's office until you get this stuff under control. Your advisor's
job is to keep this stuff from happening to you. Otherwise, all I can
do is commiserate.

I went with OIT over PSU and have to say, it's not much better. The programs
are all so out of date and disconnected from the actual world that in the
end I feel it's just going to be a piece of paper that says you were willing
to go through it. The key, in my mind, is to pursue interests outside of
school to supplement your education. Unfortunately any training you receive
in the educational system is just not going to be enough, IMHO.

The discussion is not about Linux, so I am replying on plug-talk.
Perhaps one of the "arcane, useless" skills that future employers
may find essential is the ability to post to the proper email list.

Your homework assignment is to write a bot that locates all of a
potential job candidate's email and news postings, and evaluates them
for appropriateness, to help judge their maturity, intelligence, etc.

And now to weigh in.  College is five goals (and more):

1) Learning how to think independently
2) Learning to put up with arbitrary nonsense
3) Networking
4) Vocational training
5) Learning to do the above without whining

If assignments are vague, then goal (1) is met.  If requirements
are stupid, then goal (2) is met.  Out here in The Real World (tm),
clients, suppliers, employers, and perhaps someday employees are
going to throw stuff at you that makes PSU look like structured,
rational perfection.  When you are out in T.R.W., there will be
two groups of people - the ones who have time to listen to whining,
and those who don't.  Which group would you guess is more profitable
to do business with?

If you want the diploma, you put up with the bullshit, because one
of the principal things a diploma signifies is an ability to absorb
punishment and get over hurdles.  Think of it as a tame, wussy sort
of boot camp, and be glad that it doesn't involve live fire and
crawling in bug-infested mud before dawn.

I have a great deal of respect for folks like John who treats college
as an intellectual adventure, and doesn't really care about the degree;
chances are, he will go on find new ways of looking at things, and
become a leader in his field (whatever that becomes).  If he is doing
this to get a day job that requires a degree, then he is crazy.
Credentials are needed for some things, knowledge is needed for some
things, and they are often different things.

Knowledge = Power
Time      = Money
Energy    = Power * Time
Time      = Energy / Power

therefore:

Money     = Energy / Knowledge

The job market rewards energy, not knowledge.  Sigh.

At the end of the day, the value of a college degree from a particular
institution is related to the respect that the graduates earn later on.
Somebody who trained in a coddled environment, and only knows how to
do the vocational stuff, isn't going to earn a lot of respect.

Life Span: Depending on the reliability of your electrical system,  
and how loaded the battery is, 6 months to 36 months.

6 months: if you have frequent local black/brown-outs and surges (got  
AC? electrical heating on a thermostat? computers on the same circuit  
as a blow-dryer, clothes dryer, and home electric chair?), with the  
battery draining max power during events.

36 months: You live next to a power station, run nothing but  
computers in your house/computing center, and *every* computer you  
own has it's own 1500W UPS dedicated to the CPU (with optional UPS's  
for things like monitors, swtitches, etc.), and you never seem to  
suffer a major power outage.

So, YMMV. ;)

Not all intro courses are designed to be easy.  Some are there to see if
you have the true desire and to weed out the weak and infirm.

When I was in college I saw a number of people in programming classes who
had no business being there.  They took it because computers were the
"cool thing" or they thought that they could take it for an easy grade.

I wish the intro to programming (pascal) course at Idaho State
University were harder than it was for this very reason.  I dropped the
class because it was soooo boooring.  It was geared toward the biggest
moron in the class.  That guy should have been culled from the herd.  As
a result, I never took another computer class.  I don't feel like I
missed much by getting a real-world education instead of an academic one.
Maybe it pays to find a CS department that specializes in the area you're
interested in.  I would think that OSU would be much more linux-oriented,
being a key datacenter in the linux universe.

As an aside, I'd note that you aren't in much position to judge *what*
you might have missed, as the data you collected in that region are
rather sparse.  We'd know better if you had taken other computer
classes and found them also missable.

I was exposed to programming in four classes as an undergraduate: 

 a) an intro to Mechanical Engineering class had a brief section on Fortran
 b) a later Computing in Engineering class taught Fortran all term
 c) an introduction to Computer Science class taught Pascal.
 d) a unix/c class taught C

Everything else, programming-wise I learned by reading and doing.
Later on, when I was taking some classes at OGI, I ran into masters
students in Computer Science that didn't seem to know much about
programming at all, which surprised me at first.  I am not saying they
were useless.  I expect they knew things I didn't.  But they were not
well skilled at turning ideas into good programs.

I think it is generally good advice to *do* the (exclude playing video
games here) thing you like doing, because that's how you get good at
it.  And being good at that thing makes you valuable to others who
might be willing to pay you.  And if it all works out, you end up
getting paid for doing something you like doing.

I agree with almost everything you said.  But I think I do have some
knowledge of what I missed by not taking more classes.  I have worked
closely with many, many CS graduates, and I know precisely what thay had
to learn from me (they were all highly deficient in javascript, for
example), and what I had to learn from them (java and lisp).  Come to
think about it, I'd be a lowly web designer if it had not been for the
skills I picked up from CS graduates.  Maybe I should go back to
college, or hang out with more graduates.  Never mind, I agree with you
100%.

I agree with most of what Keith said.

I finished my CS degree at PSU in 2005, and I must say, you didn't read the
catalog. If the word "IT" is in your mind at all, a CS degree isn't for you.
Many people with CS degrees end up in IT, but if that's your _goal_ your time
is better spent working low-level jobs, self-learning, and taking trade
school-like classes that are applicable to your job. That said, yes, CS
degree holders are very useful in the IT world too. But if you're struggling..

As for the content - it is also dictated by ABET accreditation.

I struggled through getting a CS degree and I admit that many courses
I've taken I'll never use again. The only reason I took them was to
fulfill degree requirements. A degree is an excuse to make more money
and shows that you put your time in. If your interviewer has a degree
they expect that you got paddled with the same sadistic physics course
that they did. That gives you something in common. Its the same sort
of thing with fraternity hazing or military boot camp.

Its up to you what you get out of college. There are courses you'll
draw from daily. Its important is to be a life long learner and
college is a good place to soak up new ideas and interact with smart
people.

Still, almost everything you get out of college you could learn from
the internet or diving in and getting real world experience. The
barrier to learning and getting that experience is low.. (Example:
Google will even pay you to get experience developing open source
software).. With access to the internet there is a lifetime of
learning available on pretty much any topic. If you have the
motivation to learn on your own and do something important, that
outweighs going in to debt getting a degree.

If you have the motivation, the information is out there.  For 
example, the course materials for many of MIT's electrical engineering 
and computer science classes(as well as other departments) is 
available on the web.

This list seems arbitrary. Of these, bash is the only one that
might be considered mandatory, though a Linux specialist may
choose another shell. My servers run more Java code (code
that runs in a servlet container) than Perl and Python. You
won't find any PHP code on my systems but you will find Tcl,
Scheme, and Lua. I'm considering Forth for a future application.

I think it's useful to expose students to the universe of
possibilities instead of restricting them to the fashion trends.

Enforcing fashion trends is what college is all about.

The needs of a "Linux Specialist" is different than those needed by a
Computer Science specialist.  (I will argue against specialization at this
point.  You should know all things well, not just Linux, not just
computers.  There is always something to learn. As Heinlein said,
"Specialization is for insects".)

The one language all Linux "experts" should know is "C".  (Not C++ or
Objective C, but C.)  That is what the kernel is written in.  It is what a
large number of applications are written in.  C++ is an easy step once you
understand C.  (And I said "understand", not "able to code in".)  If you
are using OS X, you should learn Objective C as well.

>From there, you need to know Perl and Python.  That is what a large chunk
of your tools are written in, if they are not in C.

Java is not as big of a player in Linux because the compilers have all had
closed source issues until recently.  This may change.  (Unless you are
doing web programming.  Then you need to know Java.)

If you are doing web programming you will also need to know PHP and
Javascript.  (I can hear Randal spinning in his grave at this point.)  You
may not like those languages, but if you program for the web, you will
need to know them at some point.  (Even if it is to know them enough to
know why you don't want to use them for any particular task.)

For shell programming, BASH is good to know.  From there you can pick up
the other variants.  If you are using BASH to any great degree, you should
learn awk and sed as well.  (It means you are probably working with legacy
code and the two seem to go together.)

If you are learning Computer Science, you have the above to some extent
(especially C), but there are others as well.

You should know scheme and lisp and haskel.  You should know at least two
architectures of assembly. You should know Bison.  You should be able to
understand the structure of languages, not just the command set.  You
should know not only how the programs fit together, but why.  (At this
point, new languages should not be an issue because they are just
variations on a theme.) You should understand the underlying structures of
data and how to construct them efficiently.

And if you really want to be an expert, you should know all of the above
and more.

Subject: [PLUG] seek()able compressed files?
Message-ID: <200712201733.22582.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

Hi all,

I've been reading about Tim Bray's "Wide Finder" project, where he's 
basically looking at "grep for multicore" in the context of a 4-million 
line apache logfile (that's about a 1GB file without compression) on an 
8-core sun machine.

  http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder

Having recently written a clusterable apache log processing tool, this 
piqued my interest, particularly the conclusion that the 8 cores can 
process the file faster than any disk can deliver it to the CPU.  So, 
the times on his page are based on a hot cache and require mmap'ing the 
entire file.  A hot disk cache is great if you're doing benchmarks, but 
not so great if you're in the real world where you're stuck doing 
something useful (e.g. processing new files all the time.)

Yeah, a raid1 of 3.0Gb/s sata disks would theoretically keep the 8 cores 
fed at 0.75GB/s -- just fast enough to keep up with the perl code, but 
I'm guessing that the mmap has to read the entire file before any work 
can start (or -- graciously assuming a lazy/parallel mmap() -- at least 
the rindex() call needs to be looking at the end of the 1GB string for 
the Nth process to get started.)

In my own experiments, I found that it is faster to read gzip'd data off 
of the disk/nfs and then process the other end of a gunzip pipe (kernel 
runs the pipe concurrently for free -- yay!)  Particularly when you're 
getting into clustering, the gigabit ethernet of the fileserver is 
still going to fill-up at some point, so slinging 1/12th of the data 
around and carrying a slight gunzip overhead on the node's CPU is a win 
(even given ethernet trunking at the server, etc.)

Ok, for those who are still with me...  How do I parallelize the gunzip 
or bunzip2 process for a single file?  That is, say I want 4 nodes to 
work on one file -- is it possible (or worth it) to attempt to seek() 
into the compressed file, re-sync the decompression stream, and then 
start working?  From my reading of the gzip and bzip format specs, it 
seems that you could conceivably find the start of the Nth compressed 
block, and start decompression -- but it doesn't appear that the 
compressed blocks are labeled in any convenient way (even when 
the --rsyncable option is given to gzip.)  Yes, both spec's state that 
the format is not intended to be randomly accessible.  My reading also 
implies that the gzip data may not even be byte-aligned, at which point 
I'm guessing the whole re-sync thing would be a no-go due to the 
overhead of all that bit-twiddling (not to mention the 8x increase to 
the feeling-around time.)

Does seek() over NFS even gain me anything?  That is, would the node 
still be pulling all of the data up to the seek point or does NFS 
bypass the intermediate data and only ship what gets read() down the 
wire?

Break the files into smaller chunks and use the filesystem as my seek()?  
That's what I've been concluding thus-far.

Alternatively, any thoughts on a chunkable compression format or aspects 
of alternate network filesystems that I'm overlooking?

Yes, indeed.  Gotta love NFS.

I just created a 1GB file (dd ... bs=1024k count=1024) and then appended 
a couple of lines to it -- seek($fh, 1024**3, 0) is practically 
instantaneous (0.009s) over a 100Mb/s link -- vs 90s if it does a 
read() through the whole file.

Similarly, mmap() to an offset seems to do the same thing as seek -- so 
perhaps the startup time of each process would be reduced vs the wf.pl 
(posted here:  http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/~sorourke/wf.pl) by simply 
calling mmap once from each process -- and for clusters, you can't just 
do the one mmap anyway because each job is potentially in a bank of ram 
on another machine.

Interesting question. I took took a look just out of curiosity and
found this parallel gzip by maintainer of zlib:
http://zlib.net/pigz17.c.gz

Apparently the tool only parallelizes decompression. The bottom of the
header he says, "Inflation cannot be parallelized, at least not
without specially prepared deflate streams for that purpose." So
sounds like you'd have to use a specially compressed file if I
understand that right.

Someone at PCLinuxOS thought it would be funny to add an update to the package managers that makes it so that you get an error on reboot (bad superblock or magic number. Type root password or press Ctrl D to continue. you should fsck. Ya thats great. Do a fresh install of Ultumix 0.0.1.2 and get that error. I think not. 0.0.1.1 also is affected when you mark automatic updates.

Subject: [PLUG] Sudden Samba problem
Message-ID: <862749.11155.qm@web50611.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

My LAN usually has two computers on it, my Linux computer and my wife's Windows computer. Suddenly a problem arose which I strongly suspect was the fault of the Windows computer, and perhaps someone who knows enough about Samba will be able to deduce what happened from the following account. (If not, I'm taking questions):

I now have a problem I had not encountered before. Suddenly, when I attempted to print a job from SuSE (which prints to a remote Samba printer on my wife's computer), it didn't work. I noted that the shared folders showed up in SuSE's Samba browser, but when they were clicked, a message said they didn't exist. From the Windows computer, shares on the Linux box could be accessed, though.

I put the laptop (Windows) on the LAN. There was normal interaction with SuSE, but it couldn't browse files on the other Windows computer, either.

In a situation like mine, it might be advantageous to use a print server: both computers are used intermittently at different times, and this would provide access to anyone using a computer. (If the printer is locally connected to one of the computers, this is not the case.) I had once configured the Trendnet TE100-P1U with the router, and by using this address in CUPS

lpd://192.168.0.100/SCFCD84

it worked fine with Linux. However, when I attempted to set it up on the other computer with the software provided for Windows, I couldn't get it to work! 

[This would not of course enable the transfer of files, but would solve the printing problem.]

So you have two Windows machines and one Linux machine connected to a 
LAN and suddenly network resources for printers and file sharing are 
unavailable on one windows machine to the other two machines. Is that 
correct?

So far the question is what changed on the one Windows machine?  Most 
commonly in my experience, this is due to a change in a 3rd party 
firewall. I find most have a mind of their own. I'll wait before I go 
too far, but try disabling any security related software on the Windows 
machine (temporarily of course) and see if anything changes.

I wouldn't be too quick to blame the upstream devs for that error. It
could be any number of things including a kernel update that doesn't
have proper file system support. Is this only happening on your lab
box? Do you have users who have reported the issue? Is it
reproduceable? Have you traced down which update causes the issue? Are
pclinux users reporting the same thing?

It happened following a system scan with Norton on the Windows machine. The use of smbclient on the command line revealed this:

linux-vom8:/home/robert #  smbclient //christine/My_Pictures
Password:
Domain=[CHRISTINE] OS=[Windows 5.1] Server=[Windows 2000 LAN Manager]
tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_INSUFF_SERVER_RESOURCES
linux-vom8:/home/robert #    

This can be caused by insufficient IRPStackSize in the Windows registry. Remember, the Windows computer can still browse Linux shares, so the problem is not bidirectional. Anyhow, I'm going to try this--  

IRPStackSize is not explicitly stated in this case, so it defaults to 15. MS explains how to increase it:   

The IRPStackSize parameter specifies the number of stack locations in I/O request packets (IRPs) that are used by Windows 2000 Server, by Windows Server 2003, and by Windows XP. You may have to increase this number for certain transports, for media access control (MAC) drivers, or for file system drivers. Each stack uses 36 bytes of memory for each receive buffer. This value is set in the following registry subkey:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters
The default value of the IRPStackSize parameter is 15. The range is from 11  (0xb hexadecimal) through 50 (0x32 hexadecimal).

If the subkey is not present, you can use Registry Editor to add the subkey. To do this, follow these steps:
1.    Click Start, click Run, type regedit, and then click OK.
2.    Locate and then click the following registry subkey:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters
3.    Click Edit, point to New, and then click DWORD Value.
4.    Type IRPStackSize, and then press ENTER to name the value.

Note Type IRPStackSize exactly as it is displayed. The value name is case sensitive.
5.    Click Edit, and then click Modify.
6.    In the Data Value box, type the value that is appropriate for the network, and then click OK.
If the problem persists after you complete this procedure, increase the value of IRPStackSize even more.

I recently purchased a bare bones G/OS kit from PC Club in Tigard for $80.

The kit included the Motherboard, Case and Power Supply.

The board is the same low power VIA based board that is used in the $200
wal-mart PC.  All that is needed is memory and a drive and possibly a CD
drive if you don't decide to build over the network.

I might be able to do a "show and tell" on the One Laptop Per Child XO  
laptop in February. Mine is supposed to show up in mid-January, so it  
would be February before I could do that.

In fact, if there are other OLPC XO owners in the area, perhaps we  
could devote the meeting to all of us. And you might want to talk the  
the people at OSU OSL -- they are hosting some of the support  
functionality for the Give One Get One program.

P.S.: I don't know if the machine has an external video connector or  
not ... it does have three USB ports, so it might be possible  
(assuming room for the software on the XO's flash drive) to run a VNC  
server on it. The screen size is 1200x900.

I played with one last night -- it has no external video, but you
could (in theory) hook up a usb->vga adapter and drive a projector
with that, or run the OLPC image in a virtual machine on a standard
computer.  I'm not sure if it would mesh in that configuration or not
-- it probably would.

These things are *very* cool.  The screens are amazing, and extremely
sharp in monochrome mode.  (If nothing else, it's a really cool
version of a kindel)  Touch-typing is almost impossible, though.

With some further testing, I've found that Sys::Mmap does indeed seek to 
the offset given to rindex() rather than reading the whole file first.  
So, finding something from the end of a 1GB string which has been 
mmap()ed starts just as quick as seek().

But, distributing the job across multiple nodes is still no fun when you 
can only fill them with a total 1/8 GB/s (the link from the fileserver 
is full.)

Perhaps that explains why Tim's t5120 runs wf.pl faster at 32 jobs than 
8 despite having only 8 cores?  Each core is bored waiting on input for 
a bit unless the incoming data is split more than 8 ways?  (Though I 
suspect that the 8-core 1.4GHz UltraSPARC T2 CPU is a bit different 
than a pile of x86 chips.)

Nope.  Dual core just acts like two cpus.  Linux has dealt with dual
processor systems for years.  Nothing has to be specially written for it,
apps-wise.  It just works like any multi-processor system.

My understanding is that dual cores offer almost all the benefits of
multiple single-core processors.  (IIRC, running multiple processors
usually allows for higher memory bandwidth, since each proc has it's
own pipe & cache, but I'm no expert.)

Assuming that's the case, then any multitasking environment will
realize some benefits from dual cores.  One application can be running
on one core while another app is using the second core.  I've been
using SMP machines for years, and I've always found that a lower
clockspeed will result in similar performance when multitasking.

Typically, desktop applications have been written with one processor
in mind.  Most of the computation is done in a single thread, with
possible exceptions for IO-bound operations.  It's generally
non-trivial to take an existing single-threaded application and make
it multi-treaded, and allow each thread to run independently.  Issues
with shared memory and synchronization are very difficult to work out,
especially when you're trying to deal with an existing design and
implementation that probably doesn't have accurate documentation.  Add
to that the fact that it's usually extremely difficult to reproduce
bugs related to race conditions, and the whole process becomes quite a
nightmare.  Note that this is *only* of concern within each
application--as long as the OS and any run-time environments (such as
virtual machines) are capable of dealing with multiple cores /
multiple processors, then you will see some benefit to a dual core
processor.  There are also some algorithms for which there is no known
parallel approach--as far as we know the *must* be run sequentially.

There are pedantic cases where this isn't true, and of course if
you're only running one process that can't be parallelized, then you
won't see any benefit, but that's incredibly rare.

I haven't looked at Dell's Linux offerings, but 32-bit OSes are still
better supported than 64-bit ones, and the 64-bit architecture is
backwards-compatible with 32-bit apps, so it's probably a lot easier
for them to just ship a 32-bit install.  We're still in that annoying
transitional period where the hardware is being pushed out without
great software support -- give it a few more years and 64-bit binaries
will be more easily found (and more easily built), and it will make
more sense to run a 64-bit OS.

I'm running XP x64 right now, and the only real compatibility issues I have
are with Microsoft's own products.  (I'm not using XP SP2 or greater
apparently..)

As for dual core, I just upgraded from a 2.0 GHz Athlon 64 to a
2.2GHzAthlon 64 X2 and the difference is amazing. Individual programs
themselves
don't really see a benefit. Running multiple programs at the same time is
where the real magic happens. No need to close Opera and Media Player any
more just because I want to play a game.

As far as 64bit vs. 32bit, there is really no difference. All the programs
out there are still 32bit.

Taking advantage of multiple cores without having to deal with the
problems that Rogan describes above is one reason why I've been
refactoring some of my existing applications as numerous processes
running in a pipeline. Linux takes care of running the processes
on available cores/CPUs. I get the benefit without the headaches.

Many of my applications invoke processes like awk, sed, sort,
uniq, and other text processing tools. But just the other day
Alan said:

"If you are using BASH to any great degree, you should learn awk
and sed as well. It means you are probably working with legacy
code and the two seem to go together."

Geez, I don't want to run _legacy_ code, so I guess I should
stop doing this.  :-)

Yes.  See my recent thread on the gunzip pipeline thing.  Even very 
simple stuff like `gunzip -c < foo.gz | wc -l` is running in 
parallel -- even on only a hyperthreaded processor it is faster (twice 
as fast) than going directly to the disk -- even on four WD 7200rpm 
sata disks in raid 10 (md mirror + lvm striping.)

My (aging) dual AMD 1.8Ghz MP 2200 workstation still puts the 
hyperthreaded 2.8Ghz P4 and (single) 3.2GHz xeon to shame on general 
productivity -- though the not-even-custom-built dual-core 64x2 3600 
that my wife is now running gives me workstation envy because my recent 
cluster job shows 58% more throughput on that machine than the dual MP 
(and that's just this silly little bookshelf acer practically-a-laptop 
micro atx thing with an onboard kitchen sink.)

Anybody built a 4x4 phenom machine yet?  My reading (and newegg) implies 
that it is still a unicorn, but it doesn't help that we've horribly 
garbled the jargon in the past year.  Now that you have more than one 
core in a socket -- is "4x4" 16 total cores or 4?  At one point, the 
forums seem to have gotten the notion that quad meant 2 cores or 
something silly like that.

If I get Ultumix 2008 going based on mandriva or granular I would love to present it at your next meeting whenever that is. However I may need a couple weeks to work it out. If it's a success you will be able to run any hardware, application, or emulator on it and still have it stable and have a good Windows like interface. That would be great.

This might be fine as a file server, but don't get one expected to use
it for MythTV or such:

Evidently it uses a different chip than the original, not the Atheros
chip.

I've spend an hour or so googling, but evidently the only solution is
ndiswrapper. Does anyone know differently?

I have a relatively recent Athlon64 X2 running Gentoo Linux 64-bit. The
only common thing that still doesn't work is the Flash player in Firefox.

As far as I know, *nobody* -- not MacOS Leopard, not Windows, not
Solaris and not any flavor of Linux -- is 100 percent 64-bit on AMD64
platforms yet. But just about everybody has working SMP, so both of the
cores are being exploited.

You're right about the latest MacOS, virtually nothing is 64 bit - the 
only 64 bit software running on mine is Apache if you can believe the 
system profiler.

Actually I'm using it as a mythtv backend, I wouldn't want to use it for a
frontend though.

Um are you talking about *Leopard* not being 64bit?
http://www.apple.com/macosx/technology/64bit.html

As for software apps well that depends of course.  I don't know if iLife
would really benefit from 64bit-ness... Photoshop maybe.

And MacOS on AMD64 is a moot point for the foreseeable future, since Macs
only run on Intel.
Would I like to see a Mac with an AMD64?  Who wouldn't? ;)  I don't see it
happening any time soon though (officially).

If you have 64-bit Linux, not even ndiswrapper can get it going. The problem is that there does not exist a 64-bit Windows driver, so ndiswrapper happily installs any of the umpteen 32-bit drivers that I tried, only to give me:

jjj at Devil7:~/Software/Ndiswrapper/V1.10$ dmesg |grep ndiswrapper
[  154.148879] ndiswrapper version 1.45 loaded (smp=yes)
[  154.282125] ndiswrapper (check_nt_hdr:153): kernel is 64-bit, but Windows driver is not 64-bit;bad magic: 010B
[  154.282131] ndiswrapper (load_sys_files:216): couldn't prepare driver 'wg511v2'
[  154.282204] ndiswrapper (load_wrap_driver:118): couldn't load driver wg511v2; check system log for messages from 'loadndisdriver'
[  154.285618] usbcore: registered new interface driver ndiswrapper

So this thing is junk. Luckily I paid only $17 for it.

Is anyone in PLUG-land successfully using a PCMCIA wireless card with 64-bit Linux?

Right, sorry I was not more clear--you wouldn't want to use it for a

Never mind. I finally got it working. I found a 64-bit Windows driver:

http://www.skd.de/e_en/support/driver_searchresults.html?navanchor=&term=typ.treiber+produkt.SK-54C1&produkt=produkt.SK-54C1&typ=typ.treiber&system=

Evidently some German outfit uses the same chip in their product and
they made a 64-bit Windows driver. Network Manager now shows wlan0 and
wlan1 and the little green light is flashing.

Now all I have to do is figure out which is wlan0 and which is wlan1
(my internal Intel 4965AGN and the Netgear WG511). I suppose I could
just turn off the 4965AGN in the BIOS, since its the one that keeps
hanging up on me.

ndiswrapper essentially wraps a windows driver so that linux can us
it.  This is a common "solution" to missing linux drivers for wifi
devices.

Let me clarify. I am running Ubuntu Linux on a Gateway laptop. I had to use
ndiswrapper and the Windows driver for the wireless adapter to get the
wireless adapter to work. So yes, I am using the Windows driver for the
wireless adapter.

Yep. I realize that makes me impure. On the other hand, companies that
ship products without Linux drivers are also impure. We shall wallow
together in our impurity. 

Actually, I kind of like impurity.

Huh.  The "libertas" kernel module should support it.  But apparently
not in your case.  (I'm kinda surprised that they used such a nice
chipset.  Those are mostly used in embedded apps since they have all the
smarts needed, and then some.)

Believe me, I googled for hours. In the case of the Netgear WG511 there
are three versions:

1) the original, using Atheros (the one Keith has several of - fully plug and play)
2) the second edition, using the Marvel Libertas chipset (mine)
3) the third edition, using a Prism chipset (problems, but I didn't follow up)

Netgear calls them all "WG511." Netgear thinks this is funny.

In all my googling I never found reference to a Linux "libertas" kernel
module, not even for the 32-bit users. I did discover, however, that
there are lots of different libertas devices. Furthermore, this chipset
appears in lots of different products, such as PCI wireless cards to use
in a desktop. It was from a German manufacturer of such a device that I
finally scored the 64-bit Windows driver. Neither Netgear nor Marvel
make 64-bit drivers, not even for Windows. Netgear probably thinks this
is funny too.

To add another related thought: In all my googling I was appalled at
the lack of an up-to-date site listing all known wireless devices and
details about using them with Linux. Everyone knows that wireless on
Linux can be a pain. Lack of information is a big part of that pain,
and there is no excuse for it.

And, as I said before, hopelessly incomplete and out of date. 

It doesn't even mention PCMCIA cards at all. And the sort is based on
driver, not chipset or card. Even though I finally got my Netgear WG511
working there is not one mention of it on that site. If that site
claims to be official, it needs a ton of work.

Not really out of date, but definitely incomplete.  And hopefully not
hopelessly.  Compared to the state of affairs two years ago, I remain
hopeful.  The site reflects the current development effort to create a
coherent wifi stack in Linux and to provide open source drivers to
hook into that stack.  As I've said several times before on this list,
that work is incomplete, but it is getting better.

The canonical response to criticism of that nature in the open source
world is:

 -ENOPATCH

Help make things better and they'll get better.  Whine about things
not being better and be prepared to watch them stay the same.  If you
can't help make things better, wait, and remember to say "Thank you"
when, eventually, they are.

I don't know what to tell you other than what I see on my 
less-than-a-month-old Leopard machine, I'm sure Leopard has some sort of 
64 bit features somewhere but nothing seems to be running in 64 bit mode

I spoke too soon. The machine locks up now. So far it has not locked up
while I am using it, only when the screensaver comes on or goes off. It
is set up to run the screensaver for 30 minutes, then go to black
screen. Moving the mouse or hitting any key restores it. But now I come
back after a couple hours away and it is locked up on a black screen. I
suspect that the power management is trying to turn off the wireless to
save battery when it goes to the black screen. There must be a bug in
there somewhere and it's locking up the computer. The Thinkpad e-list I
subscribed to is full of discussions about problems with power saving.

I just came back after being away for a couple hours and had to reboot.
But this time I popped the Netgear WG511 out before booting. We'll see
if it still locks up. Meantime I'll research the Thinkpad e-list archives.

Subject: [PLUG] mismatched disk buffer with software raid 1 (mirror)
Message-ID: <200712231506.23462.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

Hi all,

I've got a couple of 160GB drives with 8MB buffer and now the 
otherwise-identical drives with the 16MB buffer are the sweet spot in 
the price curve.  (Specifically WD1600YS and WD1600AAJS, where the 
former has the bigger buffer and slightly lower seek time, but the 
latencies are supposedly the same.)

I'm considering using each of the old 8MB drives as the mirrors in 
software raid1 (plus striping via lvm), but I'm wondering if that will 
slow down the writes.

Any thoughts?  Does the buffer come into play during writes?

My hope is that the writes are just as fast (they have to be atomic, 
right?) and that the reads are only slower than they would be with 
4x16MB buffers in that the second pair doesn't pull quite as much 
weight.

This assumes that the raid driver distributes reads based on how much is 
left to be read (dispatching more work to each drive on-completion of 
the prior work unit) rather than just assuming that each spindle in a 
mirror will do half of the work and then waiting for both to answer.

Does a smaller drive buffer mean we all have to wait for the slow guy?

Thanks,
Eric

Hi - anyone out there with experience getting their laptop to suspend or

nice high-end development boxes) but i haven't been able to get them to 
suspend or hibernate unter Ubuntu 7.04 or 7.10, or with several 
different versions of OpenSuse. Stanby & Hibernate work fine on Windows.

i've spent coutnless hours on the forums and scouring the web, but 
haven't been able to pull it off. i suspect the problem is related to 
some service or diver needing to be unloaded first, but i don't really 
know where to begin. Any advice is appreciated.

Hm.  How old are they, and have you updated the BIOS?  You might want to
do something like "dmesg | grep -i acpi" and see what it says.  I'm
gonna guess that the kernel doesn't like the version of ACPI on there.

I'll bet that it'll work OK if you add "acpi=force" to the kernel
commandline (either edit /boot/grub/menu.lst or try adding it
temporarily in GRUB at boot-time.)

Richard Stallman has been advising me on what to do about the whole Ultumix situation as far as the slander and the rejection I've been facing. So I sent him this message as a reply.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank You For Your Knowledge and advice. I will call it Ultumix GNU/Linux. I thought that GNU meant the particular name of the free software packages such as PCLinuxOS's packages that make up their distro. 

I would love to work with someone giving them my ideas and letting them put them into practice but in the 5 years I've tried to get people to listen about making GNU/Linux more user friendly no one has listened to my ideas other than the users that don't know how to code (including myself) so thats why I'm trying my best to learn so I can take matters into my own hands.

I'm starting to think I should base it off of gentoo GNU/Linux instead. It seems their distro was designed for remastering. Of course I think It will take a month or so to do that. I'm going to cancel the 0.0.1.2 release for now because of the community that PCLinuxOS represents and the instability of their latest updates. 

Any help you have in the future would be much appreciated.

Sincerely yours in sharing the software

Justin Breithaupt.

Subject: [PLUG] Adding USB card reader hangs machine, sometimes
Message-ID: <4771E32E.5060908@comcast.net>

I'm running the following distro:

  OS:  Linux 2.6.16.53-0.16-default i686
  System:  SUSE LINUX 10.1 (i586)
  KDE:  3.5.1 Level "a"

I have a USB card reader that I use to download photos from the card
from my camera. Most of the time it works. After the machine has been
running for a number of weeks (I leave the machine on 24/7), if I plug
in the card reader, the machine hangs. <ctrl><alt><backspace> has no
effect. The mouse cursor no longer moves. The only thing I've found that
frees up the machine is to power it down and then back up. (I haven't
tried going to another machine and trying to log in over the home network.)

Any ideas why adding the USB card reader does this to the computer?

Message-ID: <4771E34B.1020307@comcast.net>

Why would I lose a symbolic link when I re-boot the machine?

OS:  Linux 2.6.16.53-0.16-default i686
System:  SUSE LINUX 10.1 (i586)
KDE:  3.5.1 Level "a"

I have a link to ttyS0 called ttyX10. ttyX10 disappears whenever I have
to re-boot. I don't have to re-boot often, so I'm usually wondering what
happened when the lights don't go on or off as expected. It happened
recently enough before today that I remembered what I needed to look for.

The sequence of events, after re-booting, is as follows:

rsteff at Moonguide:~> x10 info
x10: can't open tty line

Moonguide:/dev # ls -l ttyX10
/bin/ls: ttyX10: No such file or directory
Moonguide:/dev # ln -s ttyS0 ttyX10
Moonguide:/dev #

rsteff at Moonguide:~> x10 info
Interface clock: Tuesday, 21:02
Housecode = k


(The reason for re-booting is in another post.)

/dev is probably not a "real" filesystem -- it's most likely created
by udev or devfs on each boot.  You'll need to dig around in the
configuration files for those systems to make an entry stick around.
Sorry I can't be of more help, but I don't know much about either udev
or devfs.

Yes.  Definitely udev on anything which doesn't hit a narrow window a 
few years ago.  You need a link entry in the udev config (`man udev`.)

   As the two prior respondents wrote, the device goes away when you reboot
or unplug it. It's a result of the way udev works. Take a look at
/etc/udev/rules.d/udev.rules (at least that's where the file's located on my
Slackware box).

   I had the same issues when I replaced my serial-linking Kyocera smartphone
with the Treo USB-linking one. Learned a lot about udev in the process. When
I tailed /var/log/messages I'd see the device changing each time I plugged
the cable into the PDA. Two main lessons from this: 1) don't use softlinks
to the port; use the actual device name and 2) for my situation timing is
crucial; this doesn't apply to you.

   I'd set the cron jobs to reference /dev/ttyS0 (or /dev/tts/0 depending on
how your system is configured) and ignore the /dev/ttyX10 link.

HTH,

   As more experienced folks on this list have written in response to my
USB-related issues, USB is complex and sometimes does "computer things" that
are immune to rational explanation. However, I have had a couple of
instances when my server/workstation would lock up totally: no pointer
movement via keys or trackball, keyboard totally unresponsive, could not
kill the X server.

   In both cases, I fired up my notebook and ssh'd into the box to kill X
remotely. That worked just fine. However, if you do this from another
machine on your network, take care to avoid the really stupid mistake I made
the first time: instead of exiting from the ssh connection before shutting
down the notebook, I forgot that I was remotely logged in and issued the
'halt' command. Oops! is too mild for what I said at the time.

   In a third case, as I was booting the notebook the three-finger-salute to
manually kill X worked after a long delay. There was some process that was
taking an inordinately long time to complete, and it blocked the keyboard
and trackball until done. I never did discover which process it was.

I find this one of the most annoying features of Linux:

1) that X is the most fragile component of Linux
2) that the out-of-band solution when X locks up is to ssh into the machine

I've found myself in plenty of situations where the kernel and all
other processes were running just fine but X hung and that it was
faster to turn off the machine than to connect another machine.  You'd
think there would be some keyboard mechanism to by-pass whatever
driver X is using to grab the keyboard so that you can get a virtual
terminal and reset X.

Or is there one and I'm unaware of it?

Regards,

You can switch to VCs from X with Ctrl-Alt-[F1-F6]

Good luck,

Ctrl-Alt-Backspace may work.

If not, try Ctrl-Alt-F8 to start a new X session.  Use the new session to
Ctrl-Alt-Backspace and clean-start X entirely.  Alternatively, try
Ctrl-Alt-F1 to grab a console, root-login and 'telinit 3; telinit 5; exit'

Ah.  The keyboard-locked conundrum...  I get that problem about once a week,
lately (it used to be more often).  Stated at about kernel 2.6.22 or
thereabouts.  Or maybe it was some upgrade to Xorg (haven't been able to
figure out the cause).

However, because the mouse doesn't ever die, I'm able to right-click on the
desktop and "Start new session" -- wherein the keyboard works perfectly (go
figure) -- and then Ctrl-Alt-Backspace out.

Hope that helps.  A locked keyboard is frustrating.

I've seen a few instances of this recently.  I was able to log in over
the network and kill X, but the keyboard didn't come back.  I
negligently failed to diagnose the problem further and just rebooted
to get the keyboard back.  /usr/bin/lsof might have been interesting.

   In one case I was able to startx from the login prompt. In the other case
I had to remotely kill the login process, log in again, then startx.

   Strange. But, I acccept it as a quirk of the X Window System which is
complicated and beyond my understanding. As long as I can recover from these
rare instances via a remote login, I just let it go. The incidents are many
fewer than they were with DOS or winduhs.

I had never heard of the right-click on desktop and "Start New Session"
trick. I just tried it and right-clicking on the desktop did nothing. I
have Gnome 2.20.1 on Gutsy x86_64.

OK. I have 17 files in /etc/udev/rules.d/. The first one is
05-udev-early.rules. The last one is 95-udev-late.rules. I assume
someone came up with some reason why the various rules should be applied
in a certain order. (From man udev I understand that's how this works.)
So, if I want to put something in that won't be changed by something
else, should I put it in 95-udev-late.rules? Or should I create a new
.rules file, something like 97-my-own-udev.rules? I'll need to study
some more to understand just how to write the rule, but at least I found
the documentation.

It may be that the simplest thing to do would be to change the config
file for the X10 program and directly reference /dev/ttyS0, as you
suggest. That will mean re-installing the X10 program. A change to the
config file is only read during one of the iterations of make (I think).

Thanks, Rich, Rogan, and Eric, for the pointer to the solution.

Power. There are currently USB1 and USB2 types of ports/hardware. The USB2
port is much more power intensive compared to the USB1 port. If you are
plugging in a newer USB device into an older USB port, then the USB device
may want to expect a USB2 port; whereas the USB port may only support a USB1
external device. Make sense?

Thanks to all for the replies. I will try logging in from another
machine the next time, and see if I can shut down x without having to
re-boot.

   Yes, you'd create your own file that is invoked after all the others. That
way as rule files change in distribution upgrades your file can remain
constant.

   Yup. It removes you from changes in udev and various devices
appearing/disappearing. Simple is better.

   In this case there isn't a benefit. In other situations (e.g., a PDA,
CD-ROM) you can configure the hardware to mount using a generic symlink
(e.g., /dev/pilot, /dev/cdrom) and it doesn't matter where that link points.
You can change the actual device without the hardware knowing that's what
happened. It's an abstraction.

It occurs to me that another possibility would be to create the symbolic
link in the same directory as the X10 program config file (so I'll know
where to find it). That way, if sometime down the road I needed to
change from ttyS0 to ttyS1 (or something like that), I could just
recreate the link. And, the link would not go away on re-boot.

It just clicked for me that this is not a usb serial port -- guess I 
thought the regular ones were extinct :-D

Yes, it would be simpler to do without udev, but I think you might want 
to go with a line in rc.local ('ln -s ttyS0 /dev/X10') rather than 
having a link to a device outside of /dev (where one would otherwise 
expect a directory of regular files.)

Consider:

  grep foo /dev/ttyS0

That probably hangs because it never gets EOF -- at least that's how my 
treo behaves.  Thus, you'll be setting yourself up for a future 
head-scratching if you have a link to the device laying around 
somewhere and you do a `grep -r` there.

Thanks for the pointer, Aaron - i've been working on this for a few days.

One laptop is about six months old,  the other is just under 3 yrs old, 
and the latter's BIOS has been updated to no avail.

The symptoms of my suspend/hibernate problems are fairly common:
- suspend: screen goes blank, then the dialog appears showing that the 
screen is locked. When i unlock it, there's an alert telling me that 
there was a suspend problem and to check the docs.
- hibernate: screen flashes a bit, goes dark. Sometimes the "locked 
screen" dialog appears, sometimes not (depending on boot params) and i 
have to power-cycle the machine.

potentially useful lines from the 120 produced by "dmesg | grep -i acpi" 
on the newer one, with commentary in <>:
-------------
ACPI: BIOS bug: multiple APIC/MADT found, using 0
ACPI: If "acpi_apic_instance=2" works better, notify 
linux-acpi at vger.kernel.org
< using "acpi_apic_instance=2" on the kernel boot command line made no 
difference in behavior, although the first of these lines reflected that 
instance 2 was in use>

ACPI: Looking for DSDT in initramfs... error, file /DSDT.aml not found.
<this one disturbs me - i found a few references to it, but nothing that 
adresses it directly>

ACPI: System BIOS is requesting _OSI(Linux)
ACPI: Please test with "acpi_osi=!Linux"
<adding "acpi_osi=!Linux" to the command line made no difference, and 
these messages still appeared>

<the following lines tell me that hardware detection is working ok>
ACPI: Interpreter enabled

ACPI: Invalid passive threshold

ACPI: Power Button (CM) [PWB]
ACPI: Sleep Button (CM) [SLPB]
ACPI: Lid Switch [LID]

< the last line repeats 9 or 10 times>
ACPI: Invalid passive threshold
------------------

i also tried boot parameters "pci=noacpi" which didn't fix 
suspend/hibernate but did significantly slow the loading of Gnome. 
"noapic" made no difference.

for what it's worth, i'm using the native Nvidia drivers, but have 
followed all the tips for modifying /etc/default/acpi-support and 
xorg.conf (which i know only too well from trying to get the other 
laptop with its ATI video to behave).

i've also tried disabling compiz (tried that first), though it made no 
difference in any of the command line boot options i ran through.

At one point, i saw tan error when trying to hibernate, "swsusp: cannot 
find swap device, try swapon -a" - it turns out that the failed 
hibernate attemps had corrupted the swap partition. Fixed that, and 
added "resume=UUID=<swap partition UUID>" to Grub, and it seems like 
swap works even after a hibernate failure.

i found this very detailed ACPI how-to on the Gentoo wiki, and may have 
to try the DSDT override, but i don't have the stomach for it right now.

http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Fix_Common_ACPI_Problems

Again, thanks for the sugestion, it pointed me to more info than i'd 
previously found.

The magic sysrq key is designed to solve some of these problems.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key
or /(your-kernel-source)/Documentation/sysrq.txt

In particular the 'Alt-SysRq-r' key should switch the keyboard from raw
mode to XLATE.

You have to enable it in the kernel usually (I don't think it's the
default), with the CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ option.

I haven't had this particular problem to test, but I have had occasion
to use the 

Alt-SysRq- s (for sync) - u (for remount read-only) - b (for instant
reboot)  sequence, which is a subset of the R-E-I-S-U-B sequence as
reference in the Wikipedia article.

   Thank you, Ross. I've not learned of this before; it's good to know. I'll
get around to reading about it and storing the information in non-volatile
memory for use when needed.

FWIW, I have tried Alt-SysRq when the keyboard was hosed, and none of
it worked.  I understand you can do equivalent things via a
/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq interface.  Haven't tried that.

I just saw this:

Sounds like it's perfect for your needs and would be in budget even if 
you have to purchase the SATA drives.

So how does one restart X when the keyboard is frozen?

>From what I can tell one would use Alt-SysRq + k on the console
running X.  But then what?

In particular, I just tried it within a running X session.  Killed the
X session on that console and started another on a different console.
However, now all my virtual terminals are messed up.  That is, I
cannot switch to vc1..6 with Ctrl-Alt-F1..6

Using Ubuntu Feisty.

BTW, I consider Alt-SysRq + b equivalent to pressing the reset button
on the machine.

ISTR the kernel was to remain 32bit for driver compatibility.

I don't know if you can do the same with that Linksys product, but the
Linksys NSLU2 runs Linux. You can do quite a bit with it. I don't own
one, but I've heard they are pretty nice.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSLU2
http://www.nslu2-linux.org/

Looks like you can get one for about $60 and hook it up to a big USB
hard drive for about $100. Total price ~$160 doesn't sound bad.

i've been using an NSLU2 for over 3 years on our home net, it's 
outlasted one external hard drive. The throughput is what i'd expect, 
really quite adequate for backing up our PCs and acting as a 
general-purpose fileserver. Management features are limited, but 
adequate using the standard firmware - i looked at the open-source 
firmware, but didn't really feel a need for it.

The only real annoyance i've found is that it seems to be sensitive to 
the order in which you power up it and the attached disk(s).

The model i have as 2 USB ports for disks. The 2nd port will also accept a
USB flash drive.

Hi all,

These google apps are nifty, but they don't work in Konqueror.

Well, it seems that google is still following the 1995 practice of 
relying on a browser identifier instead of probing for features.

Go to settings->"configure konqueror"..."browser identification" and set 
a site-specific rule for telling google.com that you're "Safari 1.2.4 
on Mac OS X".

Sigh.  Lament.  Send complaints (I guess you have to check "I have 
another idea") to:

Subject: [freegeek-bookworms] today's library work

Today i posted this on Craigslist:
http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/zip/522758536.html
And put out a bunch of our retro tv/radio/microwave/electronics stuff
on the free table. (Tidying up the free table in the process to make
it all look more appealing!)

I also went through all of the boxes that were between the stacks,
including the "for museum review" boxes. Those were sorted into "for
free tables" boxes and a couple of boxes that are sorted by the type
of machine. When i get a better sense of who's doing the museum stuff,
i'll run them by them.

That means there's just ONE MORE BOX to be gone through for
recycle/keep/free sorting. Then we need to figure out how to organize
the keepers, catalog and shelve them appropriately, label the shelves,
and figure out a checkout policy. We'll probably also want to figure
out an acquisition/wishlist policy if we want the library to be of use
instead of a random collection.
We'll probably also want better lighting and explanatory signage.

There's a double stack of books for the free table by the lamp, for
when the free table starts to look sparse.

There are also some brokenish looking desk/table units in the library
space that i trust will disappear in the course of the
everything-moving-around.

I'll be in next week. Seeya around!

With some effort, I installed Mondo Rescue on SuSE 10.3 x64. According to Mondo:

"Your kernel has no ramdisk support. That's mind-numbingly stupid but I'll allow it if you're planning to use a failsafe kernel. Are you?"

This is the default kernel, so I don't take it personally :-) If I don't have ramdisk support, I suppose I'd have to rebuild the kernel to provide it. But am I planning to use a "failsafe kernel?" How do I know?

I'd heard rave reviews for this software elsewhere--I believe it has been used by NASA (though it is no longer maintained), but apparently you have a dissenting opinion :-)

Anyhow, some people, including me, like to have an image backup of their system, such that one can boot from a CD and restore everything in the event that the installation becomes corrupted. Acronis TrueImage will do this, but the filesystem of the storage medium must be NTFS, and it uses a proprietary format for the backup. (Mondo uses .tar.) Anyhow, would you like to suggest something that serves this purpose better, preferably open-source?

There are oodles of rescue CDs that will do similar tasks. I'd go
hunting for the best documented, personally. A lot of people use Knoppix
that way, and it's certainly well documented, although it isn't nearly
as popular as it used to be. My systems are all Gentoo, and the Gentoo
LiveCD works just fine for everything I want to do.

There's a CD available with "CloneZilla" and "GParted" on it. The LiveCD
List (http://www.frozentech.com/content/livecd.php) has 35 "rescue" CDs
available. (But not Mondo) :)

By a strange quirk of fate, I buzzed through a number of them late last
week ... I'm looking for one that will boot without a monitor, so I can
bring a machine up headless.

I'm probably going to go for a hardware solution ;). But seriously, I
didn't find any that looked like they'd work totally headless, but there
are some that will work with a serial console. I think that's just a
null modem cable from one machine to the other and some grub and
/etc/inittab magic on the "headless" one.

   There's a difference between a rescue CD and an image restore CD. If your
Gentoo hard drive crashed and you wanted to restore everything on a new
drive, exactly the way it was on the old drive, a rescue CD won't do the
job. Unless, that is, my understanding is flawed.

   I looked at Mondo several years ago, but decided that with my regular
backup tapes and the backup software on a USB flash drive I have all I need
to do an exact restore.

Actually this type of stuff is in enterprise equipment already.  You
will have to
pay quite a bit more for that feature.  It is in the IPMI 2.0 and above.
Any server that supports IPMI Serial over LAN should be able to do this.
And since it is over LAN you should be able to do the install/restore from
anywhere in the world after someone locally installs the CD for you.  Better
yet on restore, network boot it from another device for no local person
requirement.

The RIP - "Recovery is Possible" iso is pretty easy to customize.  I 
once created one that had a public key and IP address burned-in.  Maybe 
it even does DHCP out-of-the-box, but you probably want to at least 
stick a public key on it though (IIRC, ssh is disabled by default.)

There's also the memory stick angle.

Perhaps something that boots from a CD and reads site-specific details 
from a memory stick would be easiest to reconfigure without any iso 
remastering.  It's been a few years since I was tinkering with this 
though so perhaps that's already been done.

G4L looks promising, though documentation is scanty. Those interested in it should probably join the mailing list.

A "recovery" solution is a removable and bootable OS that allows you to load an OS image back onto the disk that was imaged (or its replacement), and I would consider anything that does the job. All recovery CD's are live CD's, but not all live CD's are recovery CD's.

If the machine has a floppy, a couple of the Rescue (and Firewall) CDs
will let you store configuration information on a floppy. If not, a USB
stick works too. The particular machine I want to do this on does have a
floppy.

Neat.  Do these couple have names?

Yeah, but I've forgotten which ones they are. :( One of them was a
router distro -- one of those "take your old 486SX and make a router out
of it and stick it in a closet" distros. :)

floppyfw, maybe?

For a while I carried around a grub-boot floppy that set up a serial
console.  Grub, being interactive, would allow me to then hunt around
for something to boot.  Unfortunately, between the time I meticulously
built the thing and the first time I needed it, it had been bouncing
around in my laptop bag sufficiently long to no longer read cleanly,
and thus was a spectacular and unmitigated in its uselessness.  I
still needed to borrow a monitor.
