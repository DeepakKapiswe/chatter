Subject: [PLUG] Aug 1 & 16- Global VOIP Free SW HW Culture meeting,
 BerkeleyTIP, For Forwarding
Message-ID: <1249117703.28360.1327808099@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Interested in joining the friendly global Free SW HW & Culture
communities in a global Voice meeting?  You?re invited. :)

You can join from your home, or better: get a local meeting together.
Tip: a college WiFi cafe could be a great local meeting place.  Make
sure you have a VOIP headset!

For all details, see the website (I?m leaving out many sublinks to make
this email smaller).
http://sites.google.com/site/berkeleytip

Start by joining #berkeleytip on IRC freenode.net.  We?ll help you get
your VOIP connection working. :)

=====  MARK YOUR CALENDARS: 1st Sat & 3rd Sunday each month. August 1 &
16.
10A - 6P Pacific US time (+7H GMT, IIRC)
= 1P-9P Eastern US time = 5P - 1A GMT ?

=====  MEETING TOPICS FOR AUGUST:
1) Whatever _you_ want to work on - Email the BTIPGlobal list & 
let us know what your interests are.
2) Our VOIP conference server, using Asterisk.
3) Planning for year 2.

=====  JOIN FOR THE START OF YEAR 2 GLOBAL MEETINGs:
We had a great first year.  We had local attendees from around the San
Francisco Bay Area & Northern California.  High School, College, Grad
Students, & working & retired people attended.

>From the US, people joined the meeting (IRC or VOIP) from Hawaii to
Virgina, Washington to Michigan to Florida. (+ California & other
states.)

Globally, Sweden, Germany, England, Ireland, Iran & India (& maybe
others I don?t recall right now.) :)

In May Richard Stallman joined the global meeting for Q & A about free
SW & HW.

== YEAR 2 FOCUS: COLLEGE LOCAL MEETINGS, & AMERICAS? ANNOUNCEMENTS.

Two main things I?ll focus on this year:
1) Inviting groups to join at colleges & universities - BTIP is
educational.  My hope: if more students learn about free SW hw &
culture, some of them will then go on to become _contributors_. :)

2) I?ll try to get monthly announcements out to the biggest LUGs in the
10 largest countries in the Americas.

== What would _YOU_ like to accomplish this year?  Email the BTIP mail
list, say ?hi?, tell us about your interests, projects & desires.

=====  FOR FORWARDING - You are invited to forward this announcement
wherever you think it might be appreciated.

If you just need one or two, ask at Surplus Gizmos in North Plains.
They have a lot of industrial surplus.

Just did a quick glance, but this sounds like an awesome deal.
Taking computers that were considered corporate "waste", put Linux on them,
and give them to kids who wouldn't otherwise have any computer.

Linux + surplus hardware + kind hearted geeks = WIN

It would indeed be awesome to have something like this in Portland. PLUG,
FreeGeek, and a variety of Portland's general-purpose dogooder non-profits
could team up to give Austin a run for its money -- and help more
underprivileged gain access to computing resources. I think really we just
need someone to step forward and spend the time to get it going. I don't
think that's me, but I'd be quite interested in helping out.

Free Geek has already helped thousands of "underprivileged gain 
access".  Access is more than a free computer;  there is training,
maintenance, support.  There is also power and connectivity.  An
older computer with a CRT monitor can draw 150W - powered half the
time by $0.10/kWhr electricity, that's $66.00/year .   Free Geek 
scraps the older machines, reusing only the newer and more efficient
hardware.  They push a lot of volume to sieve out the better stuff.

Most "computer access" these days involves the internet, and ISP
is expensive, hundreds of dollars a year.  The Personal Telco
Project is working on providing free wireless internet access
to the underserved.  PTP always need help.

If you give away a stand-alone Linux computer, without community
support, the recipient will just replace the Linux with bootleg
Windows and use the machine to play computer games.  So all you
end up doing is providing them with an expensive addiction.
Computers, even-stand alone ones, are good for much more than
games, but recipients need training and support to get there.

The Free Geek model,  based on active recipient involvement, is
much more empowering and sustainable than what the Austin folks
wrote about.  Their work is a nice first step.  After another
decade of hard work, I hope they evolve into something like
Free Geek, and make a lasting contribution to their community.

If you want to "help the needy get nerdy", then get involved at
Free Geek.  There are lots of needful tasks there, all the way
from simple build-program stuff, up through training, support,
and even occasional bits of programming and hardware engineering.

Dunno about the systems that go to other non-profits, etc., but the
"Earn a free PC" deal they have provides a CRT, not LCD, monitor.  For
the most part though they recycle the old stuff; currently keeping
CPUs running at or above ~1.3 GHz for example.

I'm currently in their Build program and can vouch for it being a
nice nerdy way to "contribute".

I tend to agree with Keith.

If the goal is to give away computers, then Free Geek is already doing
that well.  Their model builds skill and community through giving, in
addition to helping the environment and offering a fun, tech-oriented
thrift store, among other things.  It's a great model.

The Austin folks have their hearts in the right place.  Judging by the
blog posts I read, I would classify what they did (and continue to do)
as "simple" charity.  I may be wrong, of course; I only have the blog
as a reference.  And as Keith wrote, they could build more into the
program in the future.  Perhaps they will put together some statistics
to help refine their approach, or study what organizations like Free
Geek do; hopefully they'll drop the words "against" and "poverty" from
the slogan.  But as it stands, they appear to be feeling more than
thinking.

There's nothing wrong with that, and I'm not flaming them.  Doing nice
things for people feels good.  The problem is that feelings are
subjective.  Installing Linux on old computers and giving them to
"deserving people" feels nice, whether these are local people we
classify as low-income, or low-income people in developing nations.
And you can tell by the blog posts on the Austin folks' site that
doing what they did felt good; they respected each other more, and
some deserving people received computers as gifts.

But whether an act that feels nice is actually useful depends on the
cost of the act versus the gain.  Free Geek has done an excellent job
drilling down into this trade-off.  They've defined their charity in a
complex way that strategically hits many points: computers, training,
recycling, etc., making the absolute most of the gains they get from
the costs their program incurs.  Therefore the program has become much
more than an opportunity for big businesses to write off the
depreciated value of outdated computers -- even more than a chance for
deserving people to get "free" computers.

This has unexpectedly become a long post.  The reason is that I am
naturally suspicious of simple charity because it often creates more
problems than it solves.  For example, as Keith said, if someone
doesn't know how to use the operating system on their free computer,
they may steal a copy of Windows and install it.  Or worse, they may
not even use the computer; it could end up in a dumpster where it
certainly won't be recycled.

Full disclosure: I launched my own simple charity in Ghana a few years
ago -- opening a computer-training school for children in a rural
village, giving away computers.  Hopefully I am not projecting my
experience onto "Linux Against Poverty"; but what I found out in Ghana
was that doing useful, good charity is extremely difficult.  My
project there made me feel good at the time, but in all honesty, I
doubt it had much impact; it may have even had a negative impact,
which I think is true for most simple charities.

So, my rambling and potentially flammable point is that doing good
(complex) charity requires the kind of drilling down that Free Geek
has obviously done.  If you want to give away computers, I'd suggest
working with them.

However, not all Linux geeks in Portland should volunteer at Free
Geek.  There's always room for another non-profit in this city.  Maybe
it's a technology program that helps low-income and at-risk children
get experience with computers.  Maybe it's something else -- something
you are passionate about.  But hopefully it's not a program that gives
away computers because with Free Geek doing its thing so well, that
would be like reinventing the wheel.

Best,
Andrew Brookins

Just a suggestion. This group needs a better website!

I don't think anyone's feelings are hurt, it just looks very dated, and
could use a new look. I would do it if the person in charge would contact
me.

Thanks,
Dave

I agree with David -- a new look could be quite fashionable. (Rich, your
reply here reminds me of this thread
http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/2009-July/064513.html) Keeping a
website up to date is a tedious and often thankless job. I imagine that
whomever is maintaining it would appreciate David's help on the project, be
it with the content or look. In some cases, I think one could argue that the
current website "doesn't work," but even yet, whether or not "just works" is
the appropriate metric for a website is subjective.

There's nothing wrong with something being dated so long as it does what 
it's meant to do. However it wouldn't hurt to have it look nice either, 
if someone is willing to work on it to make it look better then let 
them. Otherwise I wouldn't worry about it.


Do not be afraid to joust a giant just because some people believe in 
windmills.

Regarding "so long as it does what it's meant to do" and "It works, 
isn't that sufficient?":

As a newcomer to the area, who learned of your group via Google and your 
web site, may I respectfully suggest that the site content (appearance 
aside) probably doesn't do what you mean it to do.

Specifically, I found the following things puzzling or indicative of an 
inactive group:

- on the home page
  -- Linux Advanced Topics Talk ... monthly talk ... next meeting, 19 
November
  -- PLUG Clinics resume! ...  third Sunday of every month ... This 
month's clinic will be 17 August [note that 8/17 is a Monday]
  -- of the top link links, just under the banner, the rightmost, "PLUG 
for Education" gives a "page not found"
  -- at the very bottom: "Next PLUG Meeting: 2007-12-06"

- on page /news/
  -- The latest entry is Web page news dated 17 January 2003

- on page /meeting/
  -- General Meetings ... The next meeting will be held on 2007-12-06.
  -- Location ... The meetings are held at Portland State University at 
the Smith Memorial Center, in room 294. [not where the home page says 
you are meeting]

- on page /resources/nw_linux/
  -- The link to "The other Linux User's Group in Portland", pdxlug.org 
is broken.

My guess is that for most of you "regular" folks, the mailing list(s) 
are your source of up-to-date PLUG info and you haven't used the web 
site in years. It shows.

With best regards,
Hatcher Chalkley

Hatcher,

   Not being kept up to date is an issue separate from appearance. But, you
are absolutely correct that it's this mail list that provides the current
information on activities rather than the Web site. Newcomers cannot know
this.

   Volunteers to redo the site would be made welcome, but it might be better
to have more folks authorized to keeping it updated.

New website?  Our host, Wil Cooley, set up a moin-moin instance for
us, so we can all participate in updating the content.  So far, few
have contributed.   The wiki needs a few anti-spam tweaks, but mostly
it needs participation.  We haven't linked to it, allegedly so the
spammers would stay out, but they found it anyway.  So here it is:

   http://www.pdxlinux.org/wiki/

If somebody really wants a better website, start adding content,
or copy and update content from the old html pages.

Wil has been pretty busy, but if approached politely he might be
willing to add the antispam tweaks, and perhaps do a cutover to
make the wiki our main page.

Moin can be skinned to make it look different, but it is silly
to put lipstick on a pig when you don't have the pig.  So clean
up the spam, move and create content, and later on we will worry
about how pretty the content is.

Of course, that means doing Real Work instead of Telling Other 
People What to Do.  I've already built many plug-wiki pages,
and a few others have contributed also.  Who wants to join us?

I'm no web designer, but I volunteer to at least alter the wording of the
existing site to be more accurate and up-to-date. Most of that stuff doesn't
need specific dates anyway.

It's a website that will not bring any new people to it. I guess this group
cares little about getting new people to try Linux out. I don't use it. I've
got my own site to promote Linux.

When this group is ready to get new people to try Linux out. Let me know.

Dave! Ouch. I think we're all interested in having new people try Linux out.
It just sounds to me like some here are more enthusiastic than others to
tackle the page. I'm on board anyway -- this officially constitutes "letting
you know." Let's do this thing. I've been hosting a Wordpress for the last
seven years or so, so I can tackle a more enticing "skin" for the plug page
perhaps. Although, as Keith noted earlier in the thread, that will
eventually mean some Real Work (tm) and not just flapping my chops, which is
after all why I like posting to this mailing list in the first place.

I think the design of the PLUG page should mirror that of other open source
/ academic web documents -- a simple "html presentation is about good enough
for me" style look. Underneath the hood, it should be a standards compliant
XHTML document that validates (the front page currently has 1 error and 14
warnings.) I currently try to achieve this with my personal website,
although there's still too much CSS for it to be fully "cool."

Given that the mailing lists are the source of up-to-date news, the archives
should be presented to the user as a First Class feature on the website, I
would say. There should probably be a good /dev/null session throughout the
site, too. Generally, the page's content should probably remain general and
relative. "We meet on the first thursday of every month," is more
maintainable than "Our next meeting is October 12, 2002," etc.
Time-sensitive information could be left to the mail archives, or even the
popular website plug to: "Come join us on IRC."

Being constantly out of date is my only complaint. I don't know what
the solution is. Everyone is busy and keeping stuff up to date just
gets forgotten. 

It would also be nice to have artistic graphics. That may also be a
problem. People here are computer geeks, not generally skilled at art
and design. However, if an attractive design can be made at least that
part can remain static. I do think appearance is of value. 

I think we should have a few minutes of discussion of this matter at
tomorrow night's meeting. Maybe en groupe we can come up with some
ideas.

If you or anyone wants to do it, you should just go ahead and do it. We can
tackle getting it published later, which will be a lot easier if there is
actually something to publish.

Subject: [PLUG] On Tethering
Message-ID: <35561.40141.qm@web50602.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

When no other Internet connection is available, and I don't want to be restricted to a 320 x 240 screen, I tether my T-Mobile Dash to a laptop to surf the Web, albeit at limited speed (EDGE). Thus far I have done this only with Windows XP. Anyhow, T-Mobile doesn't charge extra for this; it may be the only major provider that does not.

I once attempted to do this with Ubuntu (using the USB cable), but was not entirely successful. Can anyone direct me to information on this subject, since it would then allow me to use Linux on a laptop?

I also tend to agree with Keith.

I like the Austin program.  These people mean well and are doing
interesting things; but they are a long ways from having a program
that does more than just giving machines away.  A quality program like
Freegeek's which was well thought out initially and then took years to
perfect does much much more than this.  Freegeek's recipients earn
their computers by giving time and effort to Freegeek.  This is not
only important to the financial well being of Freegeek, but it is much
more dignified for the recipients.  Moreover, Freegeek's recipients
get considerable training and support and support channels to insure
that their machines get used in a useful manner.  Freegeek is indeed a
great program.

I can also relate to Andrew's experience.
Charities are not easy to run effectively.
In fact, they can be extremely difficult to run.

I know I certainly learned a lot during my three years as a Peace
Corps Volunteer in Malaysia (1973-1976).  A lot of things just don't
work the way you expect - and you end up making lots of major
adjustments on the fly.

In more recent years, I have learned a lot working with Linux Fund.
We bring in much less money than we once did - which is a real concern
for the organization.
However, we have ten years more experience and we are much more
efficient with our resources than we were in the early years.

And since Andrew was discussing Ghana - one of Linux Fund's newer projects is a
joint program with FOSSFA.net (Free Software and Open Source
Foundation for Africa)
which serves all of Africa but has it's main office in Ghana.  This
offers a great
opportunity for Linux Fund, because we will be working with an African NGO that
understands the situation many different regions of Africa and how to
get the most bang for the buck.

If you have been using Wordpress and can transfer the pdxlinux to a new
install of it, any one of the many themes would greatly improve the site. :)

I just set up a Wordpress site at: http://linuxnw.net

A friend and I plan on adding a couple short videos to show anyone how to
use Linux and another for small businesses. Also want to add a section of
links to articles showing all the companies and government angencies
worldwide who have migrated to Linux. The public needs to hear that "big
names" are using Linux then it qualifies in their minds. It's part of
breaking the fear factor of excepting and using Linux.

My experience with ATT and Ubuntu 9.04 has been that it 'just works'. 
  All I had to do was select ATT when I first connected my phone to 
the laptop.  I've done this with both a Thinkpad X40 and an Asus 901.

Karl Hegbloom built the sites many years ago based on perl and HTML Mason.
He did an excellent job.
Thanks Karl.

Geoff Burling maintained the site content for a long time, but
eventually got too
busy and quit doing this some time ago.

Since then the site has been totally neglected.

The people who worked on this site did an excellent job, but the site
looks ten years
old, because the site is ten years old and largely unmaintained.

Thus, we really do need a volunteer(s) who would replace the site with something
more in keeping with the times.

I might be able to help, though my CMS of choice is Drupal.  I'm
pretty overcommitted right now on volunteer projects, but if nothing
else I can lend moral support?

Agreed on all points.

Agreed here, too.  You should be able to easily see that the list, and
thus the group, is alive and kicking.  Best way to do that is a
first-class archives spot.

I could see dropping specific details on the meetings.  Or, on the
flip side, we could add more specific details in the form of a
calendar of events; but this would require more maintenance.

I am a Drupal/PHP/JS developer, so may be able to help on that front.
Not so much with design.

Since the details of meetings are sent out in an announcement that seems 
to have a standard format, is there some way to mail the announcement to 
the web server and have it update a meetings page?

I just put David's Announcement for tonight's general meeting at:

   http://www.pdxlinux.org/wiki/FrontPage/2009-08-06

and  I have to say that was a royal PITA.  It would be easier to just
place external links like:

http://article.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.portland/27463

on the front page.

David,

I think you and I need to talk about the PLUG web site, and then we
need to talk with others.
You said you are interested in leading an upgrade effort.
This is great.
pdxLinux.org definitely needs some help.
It sort of gets us by, but it hurts PLUG when we need to present
ourselves to non-PLUG members   -
like when recruiting speakers and influencing business and political types, etc.

We also have a number of other people who are interested and want to pitch in.
It sounds like this is a good time to do an upgrade.

As a first step, we need to consider what people would like to see in
an upgraded web site
and look at our resources.

I think we should start by discussing some of this at tonight's meeting.

Also, I interested in where the wiki (currently pdxLinux/wiki) fits
into the picture.
Would it make sense to replace the current site with the wiki and then work on
populating it?
Wikis are cool, and they express the spirit of PLUG really well.

Apologies for using an existing thread, but my posts are getting bounced...

I'm looking for a good disk recovery service.
Disk is emitting clicking noises.

Samsung, 80 Gb, IDE Ultra ATA-133,  7200 RPM,  9ms Avg Seek.

Model No: 0891J2FXB95822

This is out of a Win-XP desktop system.

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

I haven't experienced or heard of this for a long time, but disks that would
only click on power up were once were deemed to have "sticktion".  You could
often get them going with a sharp tap just after powering them on.  A sharp
tap could be with your knuckle, the handle of a screwdriver or a claw
hammer, depending on personal taste.  Once unsticktioned, you never turned
them off until you were done with them.  Good luck.

I shipped it to them. It costs about $400. They're cool about it though, you
only pay if they can recover the data. Basically once you send it to them,
they go ahead and do the recovery, and let you know what they recovered. If
they have what you want, then you pay to get it. If not, you just call it
off and pay nothing.

There's also the old freezer trick, but it depends on how valuable the data
is. There are risks with both tricks, as they could just as easily break it
worse.

I've heard of "sticktion" but not that you could get the drive running with
a tap.

   The question I've not seen asked her is whether data on the disk can be
accessed despite the clicks. If so, hooking up an external disk (via USB,
perhaps) and copying everything off the failing disk would be quicker and
less expensive.

Subject: [PLUG] Laptop lid acpi events
Message-ID: <4A7B6488.7050408@holbrookmasons.org>

Long story short, I found a way to make a laptop power down when the lid 
is closed and no one is logged in.   When the lid is closed, the acpi 
script /etc/acpi.lid.sh (called by /etc/acpi/events/lidbtn) tests for 
the active user, and runs a screenblank script.  If no one is logged in, 
the test fails and nothing happens; the laptop stays on, the backlight 
and screen stay on until the global sleep even takes place. (the other 
half of the script handles a lid open event).

Someone reported this as a bug, and his solution was change the event 
action from lid.sh to powerbtn.sh, but this overrides a user's power 
preferences.  That's not really a bad thing, but I want to respect every 
user on the system.  More importantly, I still want to make sure the 
laptop shuts off if lid=closed and users=0.

I'm not a fluent script programmer, but I understand the syntax and I 
saw that lid.sh didn't do anything if users=0.  So, I gave it an else 
handler and called /sbin/shutdown.  Now, if users=0 and lid=closed, it 
shuts down; if users>0 and lid=closed, it obeys the active user's power 
preferences.

I wasn't sure where to document this, I'm not subscribed to any of the 
bug or feature forums.  So I thought this would be a good first place.

Thoughts?  Flames?

I saw this landing page the other day and it reminded me when I bought a 
new router recently that I forgot to configure it with OpenDNS:

http://www.opendns.com

It's a free alternative that I find nicer than going though Comcast's one.

Give Mark Johnson a call, he's great at data recovery. And his prices are

Personal Telco's web site is pretty much all wiki (MoinMoin, like
PLUG's) these days.  We have spam under control using captcha's.
Also, we have a way to cleanup the RecentChanges so it isn't littered
with spam pages and their deletions.

The question therein is whether Chaz has tried utilities such as
dd_rescue and/or dd_rhelp, which can recover data from a nearly failing
hard drive. 

dd_rescue helped me recover all but I think 2 files from a failing
laptop drive about 4 years ago. Just from my faulty memory, once
started, it took about 4 hours on a 20 GB partition, but with the right
switches, it was pretty much automatic.

In the slashdot article they were saying that OpenDNS does the same
thing as what Comcast is doing. Is there a way to opt out of the
OpenDNS version as well? Are there other advantages to OpenDNS vs.
Comcast?

if you're running linux (which the list somewhat implies :-), just run 
named on your local box.  no need to use anybody else's recursive dns 
server.

4.2.2.[1-6] are open DNS servers that work as they should.

I use 4.2.2.2 for a temporary DNS server if I need one.  Easy to remember and
works great.

Maybe it hasn't come to Portland yet because all I see is a text-only
page with some search suggestions, with a line at the top in bold that
says:

Sorry, we can't find "www.xyzzyplugh.com". We suggest that you check
the spelling of the web address or search above.
	Disable this error service

With the Opt-out button at the top right corner of the page, which points here:

https://dns-opt-out.comcast.net/

Seems far from the grotesque commercialization one might expect from a
big monopoly. Kind of a pain to run over to the cable modem to get the
MAC address, but I'll cut them some slack for putting the opt-out in
plain sight.

Or better yet, dnscache (a part of djbdns).  It's fast, lightweight,
and hasn't needed any security updates in a looooong time.  Note that
you might be surprised how much more responsive your web surfing might
become when you run your own caching name server.  I use dnscache
on many of my systems, including desktops that need special
split-tunnel VPN DNS configurations and roadwarrior laptops when I
don't want to rely on poorly administered hotel DNS servers.

Subject: [PLUG] Bluetooth woes, brainstorm needed
Message-ID: <20090807005151.2018c9ed.johnxj@comcast.net>

For a year and a half I have been using a Razer bluetooth mouse with my
Thinkpad T61, currently at Jaunty x86_64. It has always "just worked."

At the meeting tonight I booted my computer and discovered that the
mouse did not function. I tried all kinds of hcitool and hidd commands,
but could not get it to function. However, "sudo hcitool scan" did see
it and display its address. And when I changed the command to "sudo
hcitool cc <address>," the command appeared to work correctly.
Nevertheless, the cursor did not move.

I also have a bluetooth capable phone and I was able to access it from
the computer. Therefore, apparently the built-in bluetooth device in
the laptop is functioning.

I am now at home. I have another bluetooth mouse (Logitech V270) that
has sat on the shelf for a long time. It worked fine except that it
interfered with my bluetooth headphones, so I replaced it with the
Razer, which did not display such annoying behavior. Thinking that the
Razer may have just reached the end of its life, I put batteries in the
Logitech and used hcitool to scan for it. That worked - hcitool found
it and reported its address. However, just as with the Razer earlier in
the evening, hcitool was unable to connect to it. The command appears
to work (no error messages), but the cursor still does not move.

Since I can't get either bluetooth mouse to work I am currently using a
USB mouse. Yes, the laptop has a touchpad, but I have a slight handicap
with my right hand and I can't use a touchpad very well. I can continue
to use the USB mouse, but they are annoying because the receiver stick
is in the way due to the locations of the USB ports on this computer. I
want my bluetooth mouse back. I'll buy a new Razer if necessary, but
since the Logitech displays the same problem as the Razer, I suspect
there is really nothing wrong with the Razer. 

Something has gone wrong, but what could have gone wrong all by itself
merely by shutting down and restarting? I have done that hundreds of
times, and the Razer always worked as soon as the boot process ended. I
am out of ideas. I need a brainstorm here. Any suggestions are welcome.
Even if you don't have a winning answer, your suggestion may lead my
addled brain to think of something else.

 Find what device in the /dev folder is used for that device and check
the permissions and check to be sure that you are in that group. Check
also to see if there has been an update to your blue tooth system in  a
update from the Linux distro you use to see if it borked the settings.
That is what I would check for first.

Doesn't sound like a bluetooth problem at all but rather a problem with X
and bluetooth John. Since 2 BT mice don't work but the phone does and X is
the difference in the equation I'd check /var/log/X.log.* when you have the
issue with the BT mice.

I still find this preferable to Clearwire's method of "contacting" you
with important account alerts:  they redirect *one* http request to a
page with the message, and with your account information (name,
address, phone number..)

My experience with Ubuntu 9.04 and T-Mobile (USB) is that the connection is recognized by both the computer and the phone, but I can't view any pages. I hope I can figure out what the problem is, because it's the only reason I would need a Windows partition on my laptop.

My experience with ATT and Ubuntu 9.04 has been that it 'just works'. 
  All I had to do was select ATT when I first connected my phone to 
the laptop.  I've done this with both a Thinkpad X40 and an Asus 901.

Ah, I think you're onto something.

I forgot to say something important about last night. I arrived very
early and was working at a table under the main stairs, with the laptop
connected to the mains. The mouse worked fine, as always.

By the time the meeting was about to start several others arrived and
we were chatting. I decided to try something that has never worked -
suspend. There have been a lot of upgrades since the last time I tried
it, which was months ago. So I unplugged the mains and closed the lid.
Everything appeared to shut down and the crescent moon light came on.
Then I walked into the meeting room and tried to get it to return. The
hard disk ran for a while and everything appeared to be working, except
I had a black screen. This is what always happens. The mouse was still
turned on and the bluetooth light flickered as I moved it.

Since I could not get anything on the screen - not even a command line
- and the keyboard was also non-functional, I held down the power
button and then rebooted. After rebooting the mouse always needs to be
wiggled back and forth a few times before it starts working. This time
it jerked a couple short times and then stopped. It hasn't worked since.

I suspect last night's issues with suspend have messed up X somehow. 

I just read the X log and didn't see anything at all about a bluetooth
mouse. The only mouse reference is at the end when it detected the
Logitech USB mouse that I inserted in order to get at least something
working.

Later this afternoon I am going to try a couple things:

1) Rename xorg.conf and then reboot. After Jaunty (or was it Intrepid?)
I understand the xorg.conf file is not really used any more. Ubuntu
should generate a new one, so we'll see what happens.

2) While reading the X log I was reminded that I am using the nv
driver. I will try switching to the nVidia driver and see what happens.

I have to go out until later so I don't have time to experiment at the
moment. Meantime any other suggestions are welcome.

It might be good to identify the exact problem to choose the correct

Subject: [PLUG] Browser window height, javascript, jquery
Message-ID: <20090807211114.GA7889@gate.kl-ic.com>

I want to make my wydiwys presentation tool autoscale single
images to the browser window.  I want to fill as much of the
window as I can, while preserving the image aspect ratio. 
The math is easy, but learning the pixel height of the inside
of the browser window is surprisingly difficult.

I am using javascript and jQuery with the webslide pages.  Right
now, I am scaling the image to 100% height, querying it to see
what the height turns out to be, then rescaling down if it slops
over on width.  Which joggles the display if the browser window
is tall and narrow.   It would be nicer to know how big the window
is, do the math, and display the image correctly the first time.

I'm pretty new to all this, and a lousy programmer.  Can anyone
suggest some browser-independent(*) code that will provide the
height of the inside bounding box, and perhaps explain a little
bit of how it works and what might break it?

(*) Okay, screw the really old browsers, but IE7/8, Firefox 2/3,
Chrome, Safari, etc.  jQuery is cool because it provides a cross
platform API, but I haven't found a function that does what I want.

(ObRelevance) Wydiwys is open source, works best on Linux,  and
will hopefully replace a lot of closed source tools.

i think you can use things like:

$(window).height()
$(window).width()

to find the size of the page.  window is a literal variable name, not 
something you replace.

According to the Jquery docs at http://docs.jquery.com/CSS/height:

$(window).height();   // returns height of browser viewport
$(document).height(); // returns height of HTML document

Is that what you're looking for?

I do not believe this will give you the right numbers.  I get 1680x1050,
which is the entire width and height of my display.

What you're looking for is viewport height/width. I'm not in front of
a box right now to see if jQuery has some such function to grab that
info.

do you have jquery loaded?  there are two sets of raw dom values, 
inner(width/height) and out(width/height).  the inner is after 
decorations, outer is the physical browser windows.

This example seems to work well so far (tested in Opera & firefox):

Thanks for all the replies.  Subject to more testing, it was 
indeed a simple $(window).height() that did it, in combination
with a style sheet containing padding and margin set to zero
(otherwise the image plus margins are too big, causing the 
scroll bars to pop up).

Here are the relevant lines of the style sheet:

body {
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px;
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}

The new wydiwys.js is at http://server-sky.com/wydiwys

Here are the relevant lines:

....

   $(window).resize(  function(){ scale() });

...

   $(document).ready(function(){   
      scale();       
...

function scale() {
   var WindowHeight = $(window).height();
   var WindowWidth  = $(window).width();
   var WindowAspect = WindowWidth/WindowHeight;
   $('img').each(function(){           // OK, only one img, but this is easy
      var ImageHeight = $(this).height();
      var ImageWidth  = $(this).width();
      var ImageAspect  = ImageWidth/ImageHeight;

      if( ImageAspect < WindowAspect ) {               // wide image
         $(this).height( WindowHeight ) ;
         $(this).width( WindowHeight*ImageAspect );
      } else {                                         // tall image
         $(this).height( WindowWidth/ImageAspect );
         $(this).width ( WindowWidth  ) ;
      }
   }); 
}

I have noticed a little weirdness from firefox - sometimes it seems to
be sending the image height to the image width, resulting in a square
image, but when that happens I just reload the slide.  A debugging 
mystery I will solve after the conference.

BTW, I also figured out how to preload my static images.  I think...

I started by installing the nVidia drivers with "nvidia-xconfig," then
rebooting. When it booted I had both bluetooth mice turned on, and the
USB mouse turned off. Neither bluetooth mouse worked, so I turned on
the USB mouse in order to have at least something working, then opened
a terminal. From the terminal "hcitool scan" found the Logitech
bluetooth mouse, but not the Razer. And "hcitool cc <Logitech address>"
got the Logitech bluetooth mouse working. Yay! Subsequently "hidd
--connect <Razer address>" got the Razer working. 

There were substantial changes to bluetooth stuff in Intrepid. One
change is that hcitool became the new utility for bluetooth
functionality, replacing hidd. But hidd is still in the repositories
and I had reinstalled it when I was trying to get my bluetooth
headphones working again, which the upgrade to Intrepid broke. I'm glad
I still have hidd, although I have no idea why it could connect to the
Razer and hcitool could not. And before switching to the nVidia driver,
neither hidd nor hcitool could connect to either bluetooth mouse. 

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction.

Glad it's working John. I don't have enough bluetooth gear to fiddle
around and see if I can help you figure out the weirdness you're
seeing. Maybe if you can nail down a use case and file a bug with the
Ubuntu devs so they are at least aware of it.

Thanks again for the great answers to the last question.
Unfortunately, it encouraged me to ask another.   :-)

I am adding a small improvement to wydiwys - actually, to the
html template file (I hope).  

I want "mouse left click" to advance to the next image. 

The obvious reason is for ease of use, the subtle reason is
to provide an href that search engine spiders can use to
find all the images in a slide set.  

So - I have that working for my image slides, which are
imbedded in an:

   <a href="nextslide.html"><img src="thisslide.png" ></a>

... kind of wrapper.  Standard stuff. 
However, I get no joy if I try:
 
   <a href="nextslide.html"> <object data="thisslide.swf"
   ... other stuff > ... params ... </object> </a>

or

   <object href="nextslide.html" data="thisslide.swf"...

Neither of these respond to a click.

I can probably intercept the left mouseclick in javascript, but
the search engine spiders probably aren't smart enough to figure
that out.  Perhaps I combine that with the first nonfunctional
aref method above, which will probably fool a spider.

Given the way I am implementing things now, the javascript
approach is a little ugly.  Some pages (not image or flash
slides) have normal clickable links in them, and I would have
to turn off the code that intercepts the left mouseclick.

Ideas?  Lateral thinking?

Keith

(p.s. - if I am putting my slide shows up for public consumption,
I want the images searchable.  I've found vendors of odd hardware
using Google Image Search, for example.  The static image slides
in the presentations are linearly linked with arefs, but the chain
is broken by the swf slides. )

I'm looking to install an open web office suite on my server with

recommendations around different projects that might be out there?

In my research I came across the wikipedia comparison chart which 
suggests that both OpenGoo & OpenOffice.org have "online capability". 
But the OpenGoo test page seems to not be working and in my initial 
research, don't see anything on www.openoffice.org suggesting it has web 
embedding tools.

anyone know better?

after messing about with image maps, overlaying divs, etc.  i found a bit 
of flash magic that seems to do what you want.  this test works for me:

<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<a href="http://q7.com">
<object data="Spring.swf" width=100 height=100>
<param NAME="wmode" VALUE="transparent">
</object>
</a>
</body>
</html>

the magic is the wmode param passed to flash.

Your two reasons might require two distinct, concurrent solutions.
Here's my take on the problem; someone else might have a much snazzier
solution, and I am eager to see it!

While it's true that you cannot make an entire flash movie into a link
via a simple href wrapper, the search engines will still find the link
and follow it.  To appease the search engines, you don't even need to
put anything inside the <a> and </a> tags.  They just look for links
and follow them.  onclick handlers don't get followed; bots ignore all
javascript.  Put your hidden hyperlinks inside a <noscript> tag so
that humans don't see them displayed in the browser.

To make the whole flash movie clickable as though it were one big
hyperlink, you will need to add the code inside the flash movie,
specifically to an outer container's clicked() event in actionscript,
like Canvas.click() in flex.  This is generally easy enough to do once
you have a function that will do the work, provided you have access to
the flash code, and you can recompile it.  Precise directions will
depend on the specifics of your flash movie.  A bare minimum example:


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml" layout="absolute">
    <mx:Canvas id="mainCanvas" width="300" height="300" click="handleCanvasClick();"/>
    <mx:Script>
        <![CDATA[
            import flash.net.URLRequest;
            import mx.controls.Alert;

            private var url:String = "http://www.google.com/";

            private function handleCanvasClick():void {
                var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(url);
                try {
                    navigateToURL(request);
                } catch(e:Error) {
                    Alert.show(e.message);
                }
            }
       ]]>  
    </mx:Script>
</mx:Application>


http://livedocs.adobe.com/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/flash/net/package.html#navigateToURL()

If I ever have to make a flash website google-catalogable (I'm
referring to larger, navigational flash applications), I would use the
trick of having the <noscript> block of the containing HTML document
contain raw, wget-friendly HTML that displays a tree of hyperlinks
that mirrors the entire navigation map within the flash movie, and
then I'd architect the flash so that each URL in the tree will reload
the flash movie in the correct navigational state.  Some descriptive
content whould also be included within the <noscript> tag so it would
show up in google.  But the flash movie would not necessarily have to
reload the browser upon normal user navigation; this whole setup is
entirely for the purpose of letting google users come into any
navigational point of the flash movie in the correct state, and have
each navigational point cataloged in google.

This is just the sort of snazzier solution I was hoping for.  Thanks!

Subject: [PLUG] Strange formats for old coco games...
Message-ID: <1249805429.4248.33.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Sometimes if you are lucky, you get a DSK image that works 
with drivewire.  Other times, like when one wants a COCO 3 
compatible version of Downland, you get something else.  
The download for DOWNLAND is a bin file.  I assume this 
is a color computer binary file.  Great, how do I actually 
use it???  I have a real COCO 3 and a Drivewire 2 rom pack.  
I connect via my Linux box to a 98 box which has drivewire 
server on it to transfer images over, no problem.  Trouble 
is, how do I get something like a DSK image from a BIN 
file?  Is there a Linux based utility to put the bin file 
on a drivewire compatible dsk image file?

An annoying nit, why are there so many programs for the 512k
COCO 3 that I can't get?  Z89 comes to mind.  There are other 
lost titles as well.  I have dsk images for Gauntlet II, but 
it isn't drivewire compatible and playing it via xmess is 
just miserable.  One game I'd like to get is marble madness.  
I don't know if it is drivewire compatible though.  It is 
frustrating that I went to the trouble of upgrading my old 
COCO 3 to 512k and yet there don't seem to be any 512k COCO 
programs available.

Are there better emulators than xmess for Linux to play old
coco games?  Seems that dos and windows are favored for coco
emulators.  I've heard that there is SDLMESS, but I can't 
figure out how to install it to CentOS.

I wonder why some people have upgraded their COCO 3 to have
8 megs of ram?  Another thing, is nitros9 really like Linux?
It seems I can't run nitros9 without either a local hard drive
or disk drive, neither of which I have considering that I use
drivewire.

Has there ever been an effort to produce an open design dream
machine that takes the best attributes of all of the classic
computers?  An open design computer would not be designed to
run a proprietary operating system and it would theoretically
be easier for the OSS community to optimize software for it.
I have heard about IBM power architecture computers, but I
don't know if they use an open hardware design.  Will there
ever be a practical alternative computer architecture to run
Linux on?  Alpha died.  On Sparc systems, you might as well
run Solaris.  Is there anything else?  I think PowerPC is 
dead too.

The ReactOS project and the Syllable project seem to be stalled.  
Maybe the PC is not the best hardware platform in the world.  
Maybe Windows is not worth cloning.  I don't know why Syllable
is developing slowly.  But I digress too much ;-)

Subject: [PLUG] motherboards with linux suspend-to-ram support
Message-ID: <200908091419.04917.enobacon@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Does anyone have good experiences with recent motherboards in terms of 
reliable suspend-to-ram from a full desktop environment?

Specifically, this machine will be a debian lenny with a dual-head 
desktop, firefox connected to gmail and misc other "flashy" (including 
running flash) and javascript-laden websites, running openoffice, some 
nfs mounts, the gimp, and random other process load.  (This is to 
replace my wife's computer, which is currently running 24/7 just 
because shutdowns lose too much context.)

So, with everything and the kitchen sink running, I would like to be 
able to put it to sleep and wakeup hundreds of times without a hiccup 
and with minimal delay.

Solid suspend-to-disk support would be a bonus, but what I really want 
is fast and reliable S3.

This information seems to be hard to find, and the motherboards which 
I've gotten in the past will seem to work and then flake-out under 
real-world (aka "wife-supplied entropy") conditions.  The nvidia driver 
might be at fault, but it doesn't matter who's fault it is -- it just 
needs to work every time.

Thanks,
Eric

   I've not done this before so I'm ignorant of how to proceed. Your advice,
suggestions, and directions are solicited.

   My wife's going to visit her parents for a week and would like her email
forwarded there. All mail comes in to the server where it it placed in
/var/spool/mail/<hername>. Since she works on her laptop which communicates
with the server and the rest of the world via the wireless portion of the
LAN, her copy of seamonkey queries the mail server on a regular basis and
moves any waiting mail to her laptop.

   Ergo, I assume that I need to put the local address and the forwarding
address somewhere on the server. Using postfix here, but don't know in what
file to make the changes.

TIA,

Rich,
Will your wife be taking the laptop with her? Does she want the mail
forwarded to another email address? Sorry for such elemental questions but I
was unsure of the context.

Drew,

   My apologies for not being more clear. She wants her mail forwarded to her
parents' shared address. The laptop stays here because they don't have a
network there.

   Thanks, Drew. I didn't find that in my postfix book because there is no
index entry for 'forwarding'.

   I see that all I need to do is change the one line already in
/etc/postfix/virtual with her local e-mail address to the remote one,
rebuild the db, and reload postfix.

Much grasses,

Rich

In my postfix/postgres setup, I would change the 'goto' field of the
'alias' table to point to whatever email address I want.  I just
tested it with my yahoo account.  I think you'd want to do the
equivalent (mess with the aliases(, however you do that in a
file-based config.

Message-ID: <1249967324.8793.5.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

The client is Windows 2000 professional and the software program is
Family Tree Maker 2009.  My dad has an HP Deskjet 9800 hooked up to his
Fedora Core 9 computer running samba 3.  He has paper that is special,
it is wider and longer than letter paper.  How does he print to large
format paper?  Under Fedora's printer administration applet, the print
administration default has been set to custom, but that doesn't seem to
be the trick.  I believe the printer driver on the Linux side is CUPS.

Another weird thing, my CentOS 5 box doesn't see the printer.

Are there special samba parameters that are needed so that he can
print to his large format paper?

Carlos,

   It seems to me that the alias file is for user names rather than full
addresses. I changed /etc/postfix/virtual so that mail addressed to her here
is relayed to her there. Perhaps changing the alias file would work, too.

Many thanks,

Rich

In my setup, every domain is virtual and so is every user.  Therefore,
user names look exactly like email addresses, since they do not map to
local machine accounts.  When I log in via Squirrelmail, I have to
type the entire email address as my username.

Below is a sampling from my `alias' table.  It contains entries that
look like aliases, and also some that look very much like real
user-to-mailbox mappings.  This never made sense to me until now, as I
realize that the `address' field might really be a username field.
Maybe the distinction between username and address is completely lost
in such a virtual setup.  Such a system might look different than one
with real users.  If only I really understood it!

postfix=> select * from alias where address like '%@pippiandcarlos.com';
             address             |              goto              |       domain       |            created            |           modified            | active

I am looking for someone around Keizer that has a laptop (most any
speed) with firewire, that can help my cousin (lives in Keizer) record
tonights Python meeting in Portland.  (I am not looking for someone to
turn their laptop over to a stranger - more of a team effort. she is a
windows head, the software runs on linux)  or pop over to her house
today and help get ubuntu installed using Wubi.

yes, this is a goofy long shot, but I figure it is worth sending an email.

A friend uses Inmotionhosting.com and finds that Comcast is rejecting

 Anybody here have information about this?  Is Comcast just trying

Dropping Comcast might be the only solution.  They've been blocking 
InMotion (on and off, apparently) for at least a couple years.
http://forum.inmotionhosting.com/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=2528&p=6031&hilit=comcast#p6031

That is, unless InMotion can do anything about it.  Comcast doesn't 
budge for a single subscriber's issues (personal experience), but might 
work with InMotion.

Do you have the IP addresses that Inmotionhosting.com sends from?  I can look
those up on the spam reporting services and give you a definite answer.

My suspicion is that if comcast is saying it's often a spam source, it'll also
show up in the reporting services, which others are using as well.  And the
only solution at that point is to stop using that hosting service if they have
a spammer-friendly attitude or are understaffed in responding to spam
complaints.

[Moments later]

Taking a quick google search, I think the problem is that they don't choke
outbound port 25 through a central spam-checking service.  So anyone can rent
a host, start spewing spam, and not get shut off until the complaints are
significant.  If that's the case, I don't have much hope for this kind of
service... it's likely to continue to have a "dirty" reputation.

If you want to continue hosting there, get them to divert outbound 25 to an
internal relay to throttle and discard spam.  If they are unwilling to do
that, change hosting, because that would make them spam-hosting friendly,
triggering spam alerts from time to time.

as an isp, i can state that the big mail players are hopeless with the 
inbound spam filtering rules.  at spire we are set up with comcast, yahoo, 
earthlink, usa.net, and some others with what is called a feedback loop. 
whenever those providers get email that is considered spam, we get sent a 
copy.  and this is done for all the ips in our net (we don't require 
people to go through a single smtp server).  there is the occasional 
infected system the spews out spam and we get that shut down quickly.  but 
the normal day-to-day reports are for mailing lists the users are too lazy 
to unsubscribe from (and they all have standard boilerplate showing how to 
do that).  so the end users just dump it into their spam folder and we get 
notified.  theoretically by being on this feedback loop, we won't be 
blacklisted unless there is a huge amount of continuous unabated spam. 
but that doesn't always seem to be the case.  still you may want to 
ask inmotion if they are on comcast's feedback loop system.

   Is there a way to determine whether hardware virtualization support is

   For example, do any of these flags from /proc/cupinfo tell me that
virtualization is enabled and not just capable of being activated?

The question therein is whether Chaz has tried utilities such as
dd_rescue and/or dd_rhelp, which can recover data from a nearly failing
hard drive. 

dd_rescue helped me recover all but I think 2 files from a failing
laptop drive about 4 years ago. Just from my faulty memory, once
started, it took about 4 hours on a 20 GB partition, but with the right
switches, it was pretty much automatic.

Thanks,
Mike

I did try to access the disk by installing it in another system as a
secondary disk.
The system could not see the drive.  Tried it jumpered for "cable select"
and "slave".
Would a disk utility still be able to access the drive?

Carl,

   I know the svm flag is there, but want confirmation its presence means
that the AMD-V support is turned on and not just available. Do the flags
represent active capabilities?

Yes, but careful... When you load the xen hypervisor, it does not
expose it to the guest, so you won't see that flag.   I think.  (I
started getting into this a few months ago when I was getting ready
for an EC2 job that didn't pan out. so my terms and such are a bit
rusty.)

One way (neither the quickest nor the easiest) to test would be to attempt
installing and running kvm.  But that would require the requisite kernel
modules, which could be checked in your .config file:

CONFIG_HAVE_KVM=y
CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQCHIP=y
CONFIG_VIRTUALIZATION=y
CONFIG_KVM=m
CONFIG_KVM_INTEL=m
# CONFIG_KVM_AMD is not set
# CONFIG_KVM_TRACE is not set

Naturally you'd want to disable CONFIG_KVM_INTEL and enable CONFIG_KVM_AMD.

Carlos,

   Ah, so! Good lesson. The default Slackware-12.2 kernel has both set as
modules:

CONFIG_HAVE_KVM=y
CONFIG_KVM=m
CONFIG_KVM_INTEL=m
CONFIG_KVM_AMD=m
# CONFIG_KVM_TRACE is not set

   This is the 2.6.27.7 kernel.

Thanks,

Rich

Dear Chaz, 

You could also try installing the problem drive in a USB housing, and
connecting that way. However, if the drive isn't spinning, failure seems
more likely. However, you might try one of the other suggested methods
(I think I remember seeing a suggestion to freeze the drive.)

Does nobody know how to use large paper on a samba based network 
printer from a Windows client?  I have seen no replies and it has 
been 2 days.  Is this too unusual for people?  He wants to print 
family trees out on much larger paper than what one typically 
uses.  If I don't figure this out, he is going to demand that 
the printer be taken off of the Linux box and put on a Windows 
machine.  I'd prefer not to do that.

I am replying so that you know you aren't being ignored.  But I simply
don't have an answer for you.  I can ask at work tomorrow; I know we
have some linux print/share servers in our network.  We print 11x17"
drawings mostly.  I'll try to get a copy of the samba config file.

Apparently not. You might consider also asking on the Samba list. There is
probably about the same chance of getting an answer there.

Maybe it is a matter of choosing 'media source' for the tray with the
large-format paper?
Or that the large format paper is picked under paper size (it seems odd that
it would need to be 'custom').
 Or landscape/portrait is picked correctly?

I'm using a networked c5180 and find that switching from GIMP for 4x6 to OO
for 8x11 or such sometimes requires double checking the printer settings on
my machine.

Michael-

Don't know if this will help... but we use CUPS (various versions) via Samba
3 on Linux servers (CentOS 3/4/5) for our Windows print queues. All of our
printers are network printers, which seems to be one of the big differences
between our setup and the one in question.

Anyway, we successfully have people printing on letter, legal, 11x17, and
probably other sizes as well... the way we do this is to setup the CUPS
queues as "raw" type, then using the specific (manufacturer provided)
Windows drivers on the workstations (those drivers will have the ability to
take advantage of whatever capabilities the printer has - including
different paper sizes).

My somewhat limited understanding of all this is that it bypasses any CUPS
drivers... CUPS is 'just a messenger' and does nothing with the data sent
from the workstation other than queue it up and send it as-is to the
printer. Theoretically, this should allow things to work pretty much the
same way as if the printer were connected directly to a Windows box.

HTH... I'm just a "junior-level" sysadmin, and by no means an expert when it
comes to Linux, CUPS, or Samba. If this is truly a Samba 'problem', or
something that can be fixed via Samba configuration - I'm the wrong person
to be listening to. :-)

If you all remember, I've been fighting my laptop for the past few
months. I finally seem to have found the culprit.

After playing around swapping parts I found that if I used a different
hard drive it worked perfect. But I also found that the hard drive
worked perfect if it was in another laptop. Huh??? I thought.....

I got out some contact cleaner and played around with the hard drive
connections and that seemed to help some, then after messing around
with the exact position it was mounted it now seems to be working
wonderful again! It's possible that I will still need to look at it
again - maybe a cracked solder joint or ???? but at the least I've
tracked down the problem to where to look, which will be enough, I
think.

Everything seems to be in great shape, just needing the connection
fixed. This could even be a long term thing as it is, but I'm not
necessarily counting on that... :)

Yay!!!!

Thanks for all the input, everyone!

I had exactly the same problem with a Compaq R3240. Except I could
never get the connection to stay fixed permanently. I got a new disk
and it had the same problems. I shimmed the disk into its bay to make
sure the connection was tight, but to no avail. It would appear to work
OK for maybe a month or so, and then I'd get corruption. I became good
friends with fsck. Eventually I gave up and bought a new computer.

Subject: [PLUG] Do it yourself Linux UPS...
Message-ID: <1250286058.5935.33.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I recently found out that my APC SU1000NET unit is faulty.  The 
battery is brand new and I verified that.

It's a pain to pay over $125 for a company in Arizona to ship a
replacement unit.  That's 3 days for the echeck to clear and a
couple more days for the unit to get here.  Wouldn't it be great
if I could go to the local auto parts and electronics store to
solve the problem?  Well, I've been studying the problem a bit.

I know I need an inverter/charger and a rectifier.  What I haven't
found out is how many batteries and what kind to use.  I see a Coleman
1000 watt inverter on ebay and it supposedly shuts down automatically
when it's about to deplete the battery...  but how do I signal the
computer that the batteries are about to be drained completely?
I don't know if the Coleman unit is a charger as well or just an
inverter.  

A UPS needs surge suppression capability and undercurrent
protection and most of the time power should be applied w/o using
the batteries.

The nicest way to do signaling would be to use say a PIC micro
controller and put a signal out over the local ethernet line.

So, what kind of batteries should I use?

  I don't like the typical sealed lead acid because where do you 
  get them A and how do you revive them without special equipment B?

  Nickel metal hydride batteries are a possibility where the AA 
  variety are available at most electronic stores.  Nickel metal 
  hydride RC car packs might be ideal.  Another possibility is 
  to see about getting say D cells.

  There are some AA Lithium ION batteries, but I don't think these 
  are typically rechargeable batteries.

  There are laptop battery packs, but using these might be a bit of a 
  challenge and expensive.

So I am thinking car batteries as they pack a lot of punch, are
available practically everywhere, and they are recoverable without
special equipment.  However, open lead acid batteries are not
appropriate for use on a desktop.  I've also heard if these
batteries don't vibrate that they will sulfate up much faster.

So say I start with 2 12V car batteries.

A do it yourself UPS doesn't make much sense unless the
UPS you are replacing is say an APC Matrix UPS, so let's
pretend that we are doing just that.

For the inverter, do I need a 1000 watt capacity?  Do I need
more than that?  How do I figure out how many batteries to
hook to it?

For the rectifier/charger, do a typical say car battery 
charger if I'm using lead acid auto/marine batteries?
Will the typical marine/auto battery battery charger 
stop charging when the battery is fully charged?  How
do I monitor the state of charge and report that on the
network?

Perhaps for the rectifier/charger and inverter I should 
build my own, but how do I do that?

Well, here are the results of a quick google search:

12 batteries come in deep cycle and auto starting. Get the deep 
cycle. You will find an amp-hour rating (at the 20 hr rate). This is 
what a new battery will put out before it is discharged. Multiply by 
, say 11v, to get watt-hours.

Find the watts of what you want to drive and divide into the above 
watt-hours, then toss out 20-30% to get APPROX. hours the battery 
will power your stuff. A 60 a-hr batt will  run 500 watt for around 
an hour. Measure your computer - you'll probably find it draws far 
less than you would expect form the power supply rating.

Size the inverter for the expected load - computer + monitor +??

All modern inverters automatically shut down on low battery (as well 
as over voltage.)

Be sure to check both Harbor Freight & Fry's - for inverters. Will 
probably be cheaper than Ebay + shipping. and easy to return.

I have only seen one unit at Fry's/Harbor Freight with a charger and 
it was not automatic. (There are units with charger & auto switch 
available from Trace and their competitors.)

I am using a setup with a simple 3PDT relay:
Use two poles to switch the power out between the wall socket and the 
inverter out.
Use one pole to switch the inverter on (wire across its on-off switch)

Remaining item is charger. Ideally  it will sense a low battery and 
take the battery up to 14-14.5v them revert to 13.6 for float. I got 
one of these form harbor freight a few years back, but they don't 
seem to have these anymore.

Fry's has sealed lead acid.

NMH = expensive.

More expensive

Phone company used to (and may still) use stationary liquid lead 
acid. Get deep cycle.

>So say I start with 2 12V car batteries.

One may do - look at the run time required. 200 watts for 2 hrs 
should be easy for one battery.

I could be mistaken, but I was thinking that car batteries (slowly) produce
toxic fumes as they work.  Something that is not a problem under the hood of
your car, but worth considering in homes.  You might want to research this.

No clue about toxic fumes, no clue if this is best, but I have 2 that
I use for running my laptop when I am "camping" (for various values of
camping.)

http://www.batteriesplus.com/p-35924-wkdc12-33j-werker-deep-cycle-12v-33ah-agm-battery-with-j-terminal.aspx

$80.  "Designed for deep discharge in wheelchair,"  So I would hope
the fumes thing isn't an issue.

2 features I like:
1 - 24lbs - I can carry that for a mile without my arm falling off.
2 - nice built in handle.  however, the handle in the picture is
different than my handle, which looks more like the one here:

My car battery is located under the rear seat in my car (weird place and 
never checked until it dies, but ...) and it has a small vent on each 
side.  A tube connects to those vents and goes through he floorboard to 
the outside.  It is otherwise sealed from a passenger perspective.  I 
would think that a battery so equipped and vented might be safe for 
indoor use.

Hmmm, after looking up that computer, it looks like it's roughly the
same thing as this HP. And since they're the same company I wonder if
I'll have the same problem with the same outcome you did... Oh well,
I'll just hope for the best and deal with it as it comes.

I will go so far as to attempt resoldering of the connector onto the

Lead-acid cells produce hydrogen gas.  The problem isn't so much that
it's toxic, but that it's explosive.  If you use a lead-acid battery,
be sure that the area is well ventilated.  Also, since you want this
for portable use, you'll want gel-cells.  They won't leak sulfuric acid
if they're tipped over.

Yes, once again it is the third Sunday of the month and time for the
famous PLUG Linux Clinic!

Where:	Free Geek, 1741 SE 10th Avenue, Portland
When:	1 - 5 pm

Bring a computer you want to install Linux on and we'll help you get it
up and running. Or bring a Linux computer that's giving you trouble
with and we'll help you solve your problems. Or if you're just
Lin-curious, come and look over people's shoulders. 

We have mice, monitors and keyboards, so if it is a desktop computer
usually, all you need to bring is the box. 

We also have chips, cookies and coffee.

Special note: Keith is one of our regular gurus at the Clinic, but he's
off in Mordor and can't attend. Hence, we may be short on gurus. So if
you're knowledgeable about Linux, this would be a good time to help out.

The AGM batteries below are sealed.  So no hydrogen (or anything else)
emissions while charging.  They can also be tipped or mounted in any
position with no danger of spilling.  They can be shipped without special
handling.  Downside: they cost much more and are more sensitive to proper
charging and discharging.

   I want to install and use Mailman to replace majordomo for a few mail
lists. I want to check options before continuing the process since so many
of you have already gone through this exercise.

   The installation instructions say to pay particular attention to the
--with-mail-gid and --with-cgi-gid options. My system uses postfix as the
MTA and httpd-2.2.12. Looking at /etc/group I think that the configure
options should be:

 	--with-mail-gid=postfix,mailman,daemon
 	--with-cgi-gid=apache,nobody

   Are these correct?

TIA,

I tried the recovery tools that I have and it still is just making the
clicking noise. It just will not respond. If you could find a drive like it
and change out the components it may respond. I do not have a drive that
matches it to try! I can keep trying to work with it, or you can pick it up.
A this point not sure what will work. I do not take apart drives because it
can cause more harm than good! So let me know you would like to do?

The drive sounds like it has a real problem with the clicking noise and the
fact that it is undetectable in another computer. I have some tools I can
try. I am happy to look at it for you. If I can not get it to work I will
not charge you! I have had drives with the same problem and have been able
to get the data off it. Don't give up on it! Let me know what you would like
to do?

Mark,
What do you think?  Can it be recovered?
Samsung, 80 Gb, IDE Ultra ATA-133,  7200 RPM,  9ms Avg Seek.
Model No: 0891J2FXB95822
This is out of a Win-XP desktop system.
Disk is emitting clicking noises.
System fails to boot.
Tried accessing drive as secondary disk on another system.
System could not see drive.
Tried it jumpered as "cable select" and "slave".

I currently have an IBM Thinkpad T42 which I got because of its reputation
for reliability.

I'm looking to replace it with something comparable so my wife can have this
one.

I need more disk space for the data files I work with.

Would another T-series be a good choice?

They don't make the T42 anymore but the T500 seems like it would be a modest
upgrade.

I'm open to anything that will run Win-XP and Ubuntu with good WiFi support.

I'd say go for the T400. It's a nice size and has a good amount of
power. I run arch on it currently, but I am sure Ubuntu will work just
fine too.

   I thought there might be such a list, but since I'm not subscribed to it I
could not be sure.

   Interesting conundrum here: does an attempt to confirm subscription to the
PLUG-TEST mail list constitute the test that ones e-mail is working? And, if
the e-mail confirmation fails, so does the test. Hmmm-m-m.

   Well, Mailman wants only a single group so I used postdrop and apache,
respectively.

   However, there's now a problem when running 'make install':

   I'm running the command as root in /usr/local/mailman. What do I do
differently so the application installs?

How did you discover that Mailman wants only 1 group for each parameter? If
it was by doing a make install previously, you might consider doing a make
clean and then another make && make install.

wes,

   By running ./configure with multiple groups like this:

./configure --with-mail-gid=postdrop,postfix,mailman,daemon \
--with-cgi-gid=apache,nobody

checking for --with-username... mailman
checking for user name "mailman"... okay
checking for --with-groupname... mailman
checking for group name "mailman"... okay
checking permissions on /usr/local/mailman... okay
checking for mail wrapper group; i.e. --with-mail-gid... configure: error:
***** No group name "postdrop,postfix,mailman,daemon" found for the mail
wrapper program.
***** This is the group that your mail server will use to run Mailman's
***** programs.  You should specify an existing group with the
***** --with-mail-gid configure option, or use --without-permcheck to
***** skip this verification step.  See also your mail server's
documentation,
***** and Mailman's INSTALL file for details

   What do I want to specify for both --with-mail-gid and --with-cgi-gid?

Thanks,

I just got back from Mordor.  Although I have a projector ready
for any Advanced Topicality, I haven't heard a peep from Alan.
I suspect that there will be no A.T. meeting this month, or
possibly ever again.

Does anyone else want to negotiate with Alan to take on this task,
find a speaker, etc?

When is the next A.T. meeting scheduled?  I can probably find a speaker 
within the Linux community here at Intel.  Unless the meeting is 
supposed to be this week.

No idea. I don't know anything about mailman, but was hoping I could provide
a hint based on my knowledge of make.

I'd say go for the T400. It's a nice size and has a good amount of
power. I run arch on it currently, but I am sure Ubuntu will work just
fine too.

Dan, Thanks for the input.  I looked at the T400, but would probably go with
the T500 due to its larger (15") screen.  It seems to be pretty much the
same as the T400 otherwise.

Over the years I've used several Thinkpads and have never had an issue
with any of them running Linux.  Currently, I'm running WinXP and
various flavors of Ubuntu on a T61, booting Ubuntu from an external
laptop drive.

Seems to run Linux just fine:

Can't imagine going wrong with a Thinkpad.  Here are some pictures of
mine from a little over a year ago:

Subject: [PLUG] What smartphone platforms allow free software?
Message-ID: <20090819191550.GK19963@spiritone.com>

Does anybody know of a place to find out what smartphone OSes are
potential open source software platforms?  Ideally there'd be some
discussion of what's involved in installing software without the
permission/involvement of the carrier or device maker.

* I know from experience that it's possible on Windows Mobile and
  PalmOS, though the latter is becoming less relevant.

* I believe it is not possible on iPhone or Palm WebOS without
  "jailbreaking" the phones.

* I belive it's possible for Symbian OS devices, but in the US, who
  cares?

* I don't know much about Android or Blackberry.  It's a good sign
  that Sourceforge has a few apps for each, but I don't know and can't
  tell from the documentation what it takes to install.  For example,
  would I need a "Developer edition" of an Android phone to install
  unsigned apps?

(There are multiple levels to this discussion, alas.  For example, on
WinMo unsigned apps can use the network but can't send/receive NBS/SMS
messages.  And I think carriers have the ability to block installation
of all unsigned apps, though I don't know of any who've chosen to
cripple their phones to this extent.  Yet.)

Why do I care?  I write/maintain an open source mobile game (see .sig)
for fun, and I happen to need a new cellphone.  I might as well buy
one that I can develop for.  The newer OSes are more familiar in being
based on open source foundations, but -- and I find this more than a
bit ironic -- are trending away from being open platforms.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <1250712138.17875.15.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Since I'm looking at building a do it yourself UPS, I figured I ought to
look into a do it yourself solar power system as well.

Well, I can't find any Portland businesses to buy panels from at a
reasonable hobbyist price.

Even at $6/watt, panels are awfully expensive.

The best I can get a grid tie inverter for is $299 and that's
only a 250 watt inverter off of Ebay.

Batteries only get you so far.  Can anyone build a solar system
that can provide 250 watts for say a single server for significantly
less than $1k?  How about a wind mill?  Any other options?  To get
250 watts worth of panels I'm looking at $1.2k alone and getting
only a fraction of the power most of the time.

Anyways, I'm curious.  Are there any incentives in Oregon for people
who buy solar panels to address the cost issue?

So I'm back to getting a non grid tie inverter and somehow managing
to program a PIC microcontroller to monitor the battery and report
to the Linux server.  I guess I'll have to design a circuit to charge
the battery and monitor the AC line for outages, spikes, and brownout
conditions.

With sliver solar panels and other emerging technologies, one would
expect that solar panels would be a lot cheaper by now than they
were even a year ago.  I guess that just isn't the case.

I recommend watching http://carlfk.blip.tv/file/2213225  "Android App
Dev 101 (part 1 of 3)"  (follow the Next: links.)

I just recored and posted it, so don't ask me about details.  I did
get an Android 5 weeks ago, love it.  GF plays tower defense on it,
graphics are nice.

I *think* there are restrictions on how you can distribute
applications that are accepted into the iTunes app store (from the
TOS).  IIRC, there is some question as to whether you *can* OSS
software written for the iPhone.

I haven't taken the time to make sure this is true, because I disagree
with enough of Apple's other iPhone-related activities that I just
don't care.  I'm not supporting iPhones unless it's the difference
between early retirement and another 10 years of work.  ;)

Development for Android is *very* easy (for example, layering
semi-transparent widgets on top of a live camera stream "just
works"--hardware accelerated alpha blending and all).  All
applications must be signed, but that is only used as a means to
identify the source of the apps, and for some interaction between
apps.  (the signing ties in with the Andoid user/permissions system,
so someone else can't write an app that masquerades as a user that is
privelidged to access your app's internals.)

In my experience, this has been a complete non-issue, but I haven't
distributed anything yet.  I haven't had any problems writing apps and
putting them on my t-mobile issued G1.

You need a developer phone if you want to work on the kernel -- the
carrier-issued phones require a signed kernel, but that doesn't impact
applications.

Since I have a G1, that's what I know -- I can't speak about the other
platforms.  Android has been great though.  It's easy to work with, it
is well designed, the documentation is very good, there is an active
community, and the system is based on open-source philosophies.

http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Cow_Power

I have been pondering how to make battery packs for laptops.

Something like:
http://www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=UPB50

Only I want to use AA, AAA or D cell batteries, and have a whoopty USB
interface for both monitoring (super cool if I can report on what
cells need replacing) and charging (how sick is that?)

being able to hook it to a car or whatever battery seems like a good idea.

the only incentives i'm aware of are the Energy Trust's residential 
solar program, and you need to work with a contractor they approve. 
Definitely not a hobbyist thing (unless you're also a licensed 
electrician) but a reasonable deal if you can wait for the full 5 yrs of 
your tax credits.

i delayed getting a grid-tie sytem for our house for 3 yrs, hoping for 
the thin-metal panels to become available in residential quantities, but 
as of a year ago they could only be purchased in commercial-project 
quantities, and none of the contractors in the state had any experience 
or interest in them, so we went with good 'ol silicon.

Lindsay books catalog has a nice pamphlet on how you can make your own
solar cells.
I can't say whether the energy you extract over its life exceeds the energy
to manufacture a cell. But even if that is the case it could still be an
approach - consuming cheap energy today to build the cells, then having
energy available at no additional cost, to use or sell during a 'Max Max'
future when the prevailing prices are apocalyptically extortionate.

I'm starting to think more along the lines of a Stirling engine that
takes advantage of heat differences between an attic and the outside
during the summer to create motion that I can use to generate
electricity (in theory anyways).

Truth be told, we should probably all be running micro nukes.  A 22 
kw nuclear plant is bound to be pretty darn small ;-)

I'm in the shadow of Rocky Point, so I'm concerned that a wind
generator may not be such a good idea even though wind mills are
a lot cheaper than solar panels.

Another approach that would be interesting is to have a hydrogen
fuel cell and a solar to hydrogen panel, but this technology isn't
commercialized yet and who knows what it will cost when it is.

If only Honda's home energy station IV that produces hydrogen and
electricity were affordable.  I'm at a place that has natural gas.

The goal is to create a VM Host that can put KVM Guests on any VLAN while using
dual bonded interfaces for redundancy.  No VM Host NATing.

I have it working, but I'm wondering if there is a cleaner method.  Ubuntu 9.04
Server.

kvm guests -> br80 -> bond0.80 -> bond0 -> [eth0 & eth1]

You don't have to "jailbreak" webOS to install applications outside of
the App Catalog. The SDK includes a command-line utility for
installing applications. You do need to put the Palm Pre in developer
mode with an unlock code. One of the homebrew applications you can
install is one that will install other homebrew applications over the
network. The SDK is free but not open source.

 Portlland Linux Users,

I'm writing to tell you about the C++ Middleware Writer.
It is an on line code generator that writes C++ marshalling
code based on user input.  It has a number of advantages
over the Boost Serialization library --

I'd be happy to attend one of your meetings and give a

I'm looking to get an out-of-band management card to slap into a Dell
Precision workstation type box.  The AMI MegaRack G4 was suggested to me:

Is this a decent card?  Are there better ones for any-old-server

I have the G3 version of this card. It works well although at least with the
G3 it requires you use IE (ugh) because it uses an activex control to do the
remote console session.

I have a tiny bit of experience with products from opengear. Worked
fine for remote console access. Something like this might be worth a
look: http://www.opengear.com/product-img4004-5-feature.html. Includes
"Linux with source code access".

Sorry Carlos. I should qualify my comment a little more. You *can*
telnet to the card for OOB managment but you don't get the obvious use
of seeing the terminal as if you were sitting in front of the machine
and you can't do the fancy stuff like booting the machine using CD or
ISO image from the remote machine you are using to access the term.

I have 6 new in box AMI MegaRAC's.  They are older (possibly a G2 or G3).  You
could try one to see if it fits your needs.

Email me off list if interested.

I have confirmed best I can that they are MegaRAC G2's (AMI series 827).

All External modems use Serial Cables...

I do not know how this would help.  I need a cable that has a male DB9
mounted to an ATX bracket, and the other end has a 2 x 5 square pin
female plug with pin 10 blanked.  The wiring is as shown in the link
in my original posting.  (The term "crossed" above does not mean the
same as "cross-over" as you use it.)

The most likely place to find this would be Fry's.

I believe the proper term for this would be null modem. I.e. crossing  
the tx and rx lines.

Not in this case. While a null-modem cable is indeed a cable with Tx
and Rx crossed, what he's looking for is the cable that runs from his
motherboard to the serial port mounted on his chassis (including the
port itself), not an external cable. In this case, whether the wiring
should be 'straight' or 'crossed' probably has something to do with
the pin layout on his motherboard.

Exactly.   The 2 x 5 connector can be numbered with odds along one
long side and the evens along the other, or sequentially along one
long side then continuing along the other side.  The "straight
through" term means that the pin #'s on the DB9 match the ribbon
cable's numbering.

I am curious why this inquiry has caused so much confusion.  Did the
link, http://mail.google.com/mail/?hl=en&tab=wm#inbox/123437ee7990db99,
not come through?  I titled my posting with the word internal. I
indicated needing to connect to the MB. Is there more I should have
said?

As for local stores (beyond Frys), Pacific Solutions on Powell
www.pacificsolutions.com has a decent selection of stuff. I've seen Asus
MBs at their store, but don't know more. I suggest that you call them.
They usually know what they're doing.

Thanks,

I understood that.. I have these myself. The point is, if the port  
purchased is not wired properly, a null modem should fix that.

With or without the plug in the keyed connector?

I have both, I'll send them along with some recording equipment for
http://djangocon.org where a few PLUGers will be coming to help out,
so maybe they can take it the last mile.

If you need it sooner, it can be arranged.

PCH Cables carries pretty much everything. They're mostly mail-order,
but if you don't mind driving to Hillsboro, they have a retail store.

They carry both a straight and a crossover (null) version of what
you're looking for:

Thanks for the offer.  I will be trying PCH Cables on Monday.  If they
have it in stock I will MAX/bike out there and get it for $1.65.  If
not, I will let you know.

A little hint I got from Keith Lofstrom once, PCH Cables will UPS
ground stuff to you for not much, and it arrives the next day.  I've
found that's true from as far away as Seattle.  I suppose USPS First
Class is similar.  Not that a little bike ride wouldn't be nice too.

I believe crossed wiring is not the same as null.  The term crossed
comes from the appearance of a ribbon cable at the solder-side of a
DB9 plug: the ribbon cable has every other wire going to the bottom
row of DB9 pins and the remaining going to the top row of pins.  I may
have muddied the waters by using the term crossover instead of
crossed.

If a MB connector designed for a straight through cable is connected
to a DB9 using a crossed cable, the pins will have the wrong signals,
i.e.:
expected will be
DCD will be DCD
RX will be TX
TX will be GND
DTR will be RTS
GND will be RING
DSR will be RX
RTS will be DTR
CTS wiil be DSR
RING will be CTS

I would be surprised if a null anything could straighten this out.

I think that is more a row-first vs column-first distinction than a
straight vs crossover (null) distinction.  Crossover wiring in my
experience is much more complex than that (although my recent work has
been on simple 3-wire serial that doesn't involve hardware
handshaking, and is consequentially much simpler).

<joke>
  I am not sure if PCH Cables carries these babies though, which if
  you care about the good karmic health of your electrons, you will
  certainly want several of:

I have one of these cables if you still need one.

BTW, the origin of the 'crossed' wiring is undoubtedly due to the use 
of IDC(insulation displacement connector) versions of the DB9.  Here's 
an example:
http://media.digikey.com/photos/CW Ind Photos/CWR-180-09-0000.jpg
This DB9 is simply clamped onto the ribbon cable rather than having to 
solder each wire.  The scary thing is that it is apparently cheaper to 
have someone solder 9 individual wires.  Thus it's rare to see an IDC 
DB9 in a PC.

Galen,
Thanks for the offer.  Yes, I do still need one.  Is it at least 8 inches long?

The IDC DB9 is clearly the explanation for the "crossed" wiring.  It
is scary to think that little hands soldering 9 leads is cheaper than
clamping an IDC closed.   Could it be that the IDC is too wide for
mounting on a ATX case bracket?  Or maybe the connector itself is more
expensive to make?  Can the molded style be wired by robots?

Yes.  The cable is ~10 inches.  Send me a private email to discuss a 
hand off.

It's certainly possible that mechanical issues prevented widespread 
use of the IDC DB9, but with all the cost pressure of the PC market, 
it's surprising that someone didn't come up with a cheaper solution. 
I guess it just shows how low the labor costs are in some parts of Asia.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0908251415210.19633@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have a Logitech QuickCam Communicate STX camera connected via USB. When
I invoke Ekiga (formerly GnomeMeeting) and try to configure it I'm told that
the camera's driver does not support the colors that Ekiga does.

   Running lsusb shows me the device:

Bus 002 Device 002: ID 046d:08ad Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Communicate STX

   How do I identify the driver and how do I select one that will work
w/Ekiga?

   A bit of poking around told me the camera should work with video4linux,
and lsmod tells me these modules are loaded:

gspca_zc3xx            50688  1 
gspca_main             23808  1 gspca_zc3xx
videodev               36736  2 gspca_main
v4l1_compat            17924  1 videodev

   So, where do I now look to learn why Ekiga has issues with the camera?

I am absolutely no expert on cameras.  But I did @#$% around a bit with
them recently.  The very first step is to get it working with xawtv.  Do
you have that working?

I've had good luck with my Logitech web cam and the UVC driver.  Their
site is: 
  http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/

And Logitech has more info here:
  http://www.quickcamteam.net/devices

It's looking like your camera is indeed a UVC device, but it doesn't
list any info about support.  See if you can get the uvcvideo kernel
module loaded and maybe it'll magically work.

Good luck,
tim

Carlos,

   No. When I looked at xawtv I read that it's for watching TV on the
computer so I didn't pursue that line. Guess that I will now. :-)

Thanks,

tim,

   Thanks for the pointer. I have
/lib/modules/2.6.27.7-smp/kernel/drivers/media/video/uvc/uvcvideo.ko, but
cannot load it. 'insmod' fails with the message:

insmod: can't read 'uvcvideo.ko': No such file or directory

   When I try passing the full path I get an error about 'unknown symbol in
module'. I had this problem months ago and have no recollection of what it
took to load the module. Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Rich

Carlos,

   What version of xawtv are you running? I tried compiling 3.95 and it
failed:

console/fbtools.c:24:22: error: asm/page.h: No such file or directory
console/fbtools.c: In function 'fb_init':

   Nuts!

Just saw your updated thread Rich. Sorry about that. I have the same camera

Drew,

   OK. What do you suggest I do to figure out why it's not working here?

   Can't build xawtv or camstream. I reported the error for xawtv, for
camstream it's:

make[4]: Entering directory /opt/src/camstream-080705/camstream/codec'
make[4]: *** No rule to make target ideoCodecQtThread.moc.o', needed by

   Sigh.

   Tried an earlier version of CamStream and that built and installed just
fine. The application starts, the blue light on the camera turns on, but all
I see the little window with a black background, but no image from the
camera. In the virtual console I see this:

W: VDLinux::run() VIDIOCMCAPTURE failed (Invalid argument)
W: run(): VIDIOCSYNC(1) failed (Invalid argument)

   No help from the CamStream web site.

This may obviate your need for xawtv.  But anyway, my version is:

   This is xawtv-3.95, running on Linux/i686 (2.6.30.3)

I use the vanilla kernel.  It may be worth building a kernel to see if
it helps v4l2 functionality.

I was working along in KDE when it crashed.  On restart KDE wallet appears, a Konsole window pops up and a few seconds later KDE crashes again.

"working along" means I had Firefox and Konqueror up, kmail running, three planentarium programs (I'm evaluating) and had just selected the gaussian transform tool in Gimp. 


I'd like to reset KDE so it doesn't start up any applications on startup.  Where is the clean place to do that?

Also open to suggestions for another approach.

~/.kde has 1905 files in the tree.  That's a mite too few to go through - and I've already tried the obvious ones.

There's also a tree in /var/tmp worth investigating

Subject: [PLUG] X is messed up
Message-ID: <20090827131412.f0bea4f5.johnxj@comcast.net>

A month or so ago I asked here for suggestions as to why my bluetooth
mouse stopped working. It happened after our August general meeting. I
had tried to suspend (which never works because I can't restore). I
hadn't tried suspend for a long time, so I tried it again just to see
if perhaps some of the constant updates had fixed things. Suspend was
still broken, and the only way to restore was to use the power button
and restart. After restarting the mouse was dead and nothing I could do
would get it working again. However, bluetooth was working fine because
I can connect to my phone, and "hcitool scan" finds the mouse.

Drew suggested here that if bluetooth is working, then the problem must
be in X. So I switched from the nv driver to the nVidia driver and
restarted the computer. (Can't do Ctrl-alt-backspace on current
incarnations of Gnome.) When X came up the mouse was working. I
switched back to the nv driver and the mouse has continued to work.
That is, until this morning, when I discovered that overnight it died
again. Sadly, switching drivers did not restore it this time.
Otherwise, same symptoms - "hcitool scan" finds it, and "hcitool cc
<address> executes without error, but no mousie. I have another
bluetooth mouse and I get the same results with it.

There's more. Ever since that fateful night the desktop font (Sans, 9
pt) has been slightly messed up. The linespacing is too wide, and when
I type into a dialog box the text jumps down so the lower half of the
letters are cut off. Numerals also appear in various point sizes.
Changing to a different font does not help.

And still more. I now have occasional system lockups. Once the capslock
light was flashing, but usually it just quietly locks up - no mouse, no
keyboard. There are no messages in /var/log/messages. Also, Firefox
decides to crash about once a day, always when clicking on a link in a
web page. When I restart Firefox the same link works fine. Previously
Firefox was always rock solid.

So I conclude that something is messed up in X and it is causing all
these woes. I have decided that I should just reinstall X. But there is
my problem. Google cannot tell me what "X" actually consists of. It's
probably more than one package, but which ones? Also, what will happen
if I uninstall X from the GUI? Like, Synaptic sort of needs a GUI, so
I'm not sure the reinstall will work properly. I'm thinking I should do
the whole uninstall-reinstall from the command line after booting to
Recovery Mode. That means I need a paper list of packages. Or maybe
it's Gnome, not X. I don't actually know where X ends and Gnome starts. 

The system is sort of working, so before I do something and make things
worse I decided to ask for suggestions. Oh, and "reinstall Jaunty" is
not a good option. It would take days to get all my programs
reinstalled, some of which required tweaks that I don't even remember. 

Any brainstorms?

In Synaptic I found a large number of files matching a search for
xorg, including a metapackage simply titled Xorg.  I would suspect
that removing everything xorg and accepting the dependent removals,
noting then beforehand, would get rid of X.

But because there are a bunch of packages, perhaps there is one or
another that is related to either bluetooth or mouse management that
may be the root source.

Aptitude is the CLI equivalent.

Section Gnome shows all those packages.  Again, it might be possible
to narrow down the root to a bluetooth or mouse package.

Backups and clones would have helped, but they need to be done after a
fresh install with all your tweaks.

That's odd, I just tried it, and it works here.  Come to think of it, I
don't think that <ctrl-alt-BS> is a Gnome function.  I'm pretty sure
it's in X.  (I'm running Gnome 2.24.3 on Fedora 10, kernel version
2.6.27.29-170.2.79.fc10.i686)  It is possible to turn off that hotkey
combo, but I don't know if Ubuntu does that.  The fact that all sorts of
things are going wrong suggests to my hardware-oriented little mind
that you may have some bad ram.  The flashing caps lock light suggests
a kernel crash to me.  X can cause that sort of thing, but so can bad
ram.  Have you tried running a memory test program?

I'm sorry I can't be of much help with the Bluetooth problem; I don't
have any Bluetooth peripherals.

The flashing capslock and no input sounds like bad drivers.  I've seen
flaky video cards/drivers cause this sort of lockup.  Typically you
can still use SSH to remote into the machine and poke around.  The
crashing of FF sounds like, well no offense to Mozilla.org but, FF
crashes a lot for me on every platform.  Flash tends to greatly
exacerbate the crashing and is used a lot in ads.  Installing a FF
plugin like adblock plus (if you don't already have it) can help.
Have you checked to see if FF is getting killed by the out of memory
killer?  The logs might say but I forget which one to check.  It's
entirely possible that FF is using and then requesting too much memory
and getting killed by the kernel.  Adding swap can help if this is the
case.  Adding a swap file is easier than adding a swap partition, so
don't worry about repartitioning just to get some swap.

Because you mention the font weirdness I would suspect Gnome and not
X.  I personally have observed Gnome causing font size weirdness and I
know others who have had similar issues.

I certainly wouldn't resort to reinstalling to troubleshoot this.  If
it's software packages that are goofed up, you should either be able
to upgrade them or downgrade them, more likely, fix their broken
config files.  I've never run Ubuntu, but anecdotes from friends
indicate that Ubuntu doesn't have the best QA in their updates.  I
think you're probably going to have to try and isolate some of the
variables yourself.

For example, run a different desktop than Gnome.  Try running your
kernel with fewer drivers.  Check if your graphics chipset is known
for bad linux support.  Try the nVidia driver for a while and see if
FF stops crashing.  Check up on the FF memory usage during the day and
see if there is a pattern with how much memory it is using when it
crashes.  Check the log after FF crashes to see if the OOM killer is
mentioned.  Does your computer overheat?  Is your powersupply
regulating properly (I had a problem where kernel threads would died
after several days of uptime due to a bad powersupply once)?

Eventually you will have to reinstall anyway.  For example, if you get
a new computer.  Therefore, I would recommend investing some time into
backing up your tweaks and configuration stuff now.

Kernel panic.  unlikely that you will find anything in the logs
because it requires a write to a log file buffer, then flush that
buffer to disk.  If you have a 2nd machine on your lan that you can
run nc on, you can setup the troubled machine to write to the 2nd
machine too.

http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt

logging box: (IP 192.168.1.155)
$ netcat -l -u -p 6666

trouble box:
$ sudo modprobe netconsole netconsole="@/, at 192.168.1.155/"

Now when the trouble box panics, you should see the dump on the logging box.

It will look something like the dumps shown here:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13075

This won't at all fix anything, but might give you a clue what is breaking.

No I haven't done any memory checks, but I certainly can and will.

I doubt it's the RAM. I did upgrade the RAM from 2 GB to 4 GB, but that
was back in December or January, and these problems have been happening
only for the past 3-4 weeks. Of course, the RAM could have developed a
failure, so I can't completely rule it out. Still, I don't see how RAM
could cause funny appearance of fonts.

It could be bad RAM, but not lack of it. The computer has 4 GB and
there is 4 GB swap. I'm going to run a memory check overnight, but I
doubt it will show anything. The problems started only 3-4 weeks ago,
so it would have to be a failure of RAM that worked fine until now.

As for Firefox, it has always been solid for me. However, while writing
this just now I decided to Google on how to detect CPU temps. As I was
typing my search string into the dialog box the whole computer locked
up. Sometimes Firefox just disappears, and other times the whole
computer locks up. And at the time I had only two other tabs open in
Firefox, and the only other app that was running was my mail client
Sylpheed.

It could be more than one problem. Suppose the font weirdness has
nothing to do with the lockups and crashing. Having said that, when
several different things start happening all at the same time, it is
natural to assume they are caused by the same thing, even though the
things may appear unrelated.

It is certainly true that sometimes Ubuntu's Update Manager announces
things when Ubuntu should have held off a bit. If Update Manager says
there is a new version of Gedit, you're probably safe to install it.
But if it is a new kernel, read the forums for a few days before
jumping on it.

The CPUs are not overheating, that is, if 45C is acceptable. But, as
you note, there's a lot of hardware in this thing. I did try the nVidia
driver, but things were just as bad.

It's very difficult tpo troubleshoot because there are no messages. And
I don't have another computer I can send error messages to. And the
lockups happen only every other day or so. I did have the computer lock
up once previously while typing something into Google's search box, but
otherwise I can't see any patterns. Firefox is not the only app that
has crashed either; it's just that I use it more than other apps so it
gives the impression that the whole problem is caused by Firefox.

I think I'm going to run a memtest overnight and, assuming it doesn't
turn up anything, boot without the bluetooth module. If I still have
problems, then I'll look into what it takes to reinstall Gnome.

However, if you are in trouble already, a liberal across the board
upgrade might be just the cure.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0908291247440.6394@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My Subversion repository was created with the BerkeleyDB version included
in an earlier Slackware than is currently running. When I try to commit
changes the attempt fails due to BDB errors.

   A Google search turned up an equivalent situation using LDAP, but the
solution is specific to that application and not applicable to Subversion.
Another Google search on "upgrading BerkeleyDB" produced a page that leads
to other pages, but the commands (e.g., DB->upgrade, or DB_ENV-*) cannot be
executed because the shell doesn't find them. The Web pages probably make
sense to those who know BerkeleyDB inside and out, but not to a naive user
like me who's stuck with an application that uses it as the back end.

   Does anyone here know how to upgrade BDB? I have the following versions
installed:

db1-1.85-i386-1
db3-3.3.11-i486-4
db44-4.4.20-i486-2

   I suspect the Subversion repository database was created with db4.2.

Rich,

It's unfortunate that you're using BDB with your svn repo.  The file
system db is more robust across versions.  I would recommend getting
away from BDB in the future.

I would try getting the old version of db on their so you can work
with the data.  Then, I think you need an svn specific tool.  I would
recommend exporting your repository, creating one that uses the file
system db and reimporting your repository.

I recommend the svn red bean book for reference purposes:
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/ch05s03.html

The section I just linked should contain all the information you need
to export your repository and reimport it once you can access it
again.

Good luck!

Jason

Jason,

   I've no particular liking of BDB; I'd rather use SQLite or anything else.
But, I don't know how to direct Subversion to use a different DB.

   I'll try loading dbd42; that's probably what was current when I created
the repository.

   I bought Mike Mason's SVN book in 2005 and it's been helpful. Doesn't
cover this case, of course. In retrospect I'm disappointed that the SVN
developers didn't consider changes in the db back end and build in upgrades
when the application is upgraded.

Thanks,

Rich

This is why I still use CVS.  I can go in there and reconstruct the
files even in the worst case scenario.  Any system that stores the
data in a non-human-readable format worries me.  A database backend is
fine as long as it stores text, not blobs.  Even subversion's file
backend is binary, which will not do.

As Jason mentioned install Berkley 4.2 and you should be good to go. I had a
major problem with BDB upgrade and LDAP earlier this year. You may remember
that fiasco Rich :)

Carlos,

   It's not before been an issue. Perhaps I should consider git. You're right
in writing that a tool such as a version control system should store initial
files and diffs in a easily-read format to be used by any vcs.

   I removed the repository and the project directory's .svn subdirectory,
then recreated the former and started over again. For this project it's no
big deal to lose all 130+ former versions.

Thanks,

Rich

Drew,

   I installed db42 from the Slackware-12.0 distribution, but it made no
difference, even when I ran ldconfig first. So, I gave up, blew away the
repository and started over.

   Yes, I remember your problem with LDAP and BDB; there's a thread on that
specific problem on someone's web page. It didn't help me at all.

   I've rummaged around the git Web site without learning the format for its
data. Does anyone here know this? Is it text-based or does it use a binary
database format?

   No sense getting out of the subversion mess into an equal mess.

Rich,

Unless you have very large code base, history, or very large files I
doubt you will benefit from git compared with other distributed
version control systems.  If you are a casual vcs user and you want a
solid vcs that emphasizes ease of use, try darcs.  It's mature,
stable, and gets a lot of praise for ease of use.

http://darcs.net

I recommend using something in the 2.x series.

Jason

   OK.

   Subversion worked fine for a couple of years. But among upgrades to the
distribution, BDB, and Subversion itself, something broke. That's not nice
behavior.

   I'll try darcs.

I have made some progress.

Among other troubleshooting ideas your suggestion to try a different
desktop made a lot of sense. So I installed kubuntu-desktop, then
restarted and logged into KDE. Things were even more messed up. You
know those four or five big icons that appear in the middle of the
screen one after the other while KDE is loading? All I got was black
boxes. And the desktop font was still weird. And I could still lock up
the computer. So that experience acquits Gnome of guilt.

While doing testing I discovered that typing anything in a Google box
in Firefox will bring down Firefox or the entire computer very quickly.
I don't mean the Google search page - I mean the little box to the
right of the URL bar. Four or five searches is as far as I could go
without crashing or locking up. It is good to have a litmus test. Now I
can make changes and find out quickly if they solved the problem.

I went into Synaptic and searched on xorg, then reinstalled anything
that looked like it had something to do with fonts or mice. No luck.

While in Synaptic I decided to do some housecleaning. I had a ton of
apps installed that I never used, so I removed a lot of them - almost a
GB of files. Didn't make any difference, but a clean house is nicer to
live in.

Finally I decided to try rebooting to older kernels. My up-to-date
Jaunty had 2.6.28-15, so I rebooted to -14. No luck. Then I rebooted to
-13. And that made a big difference - finally I can type repeated
searches in the Google box without locking up. I have done about 30
searches without a problem. It is too soon to be sure, but it looks as
though a major problem has been resolved. Please cross your fingers for
me.

The mice still don't work, though. And I need to find what happened
between -13 and -14. I might find some big clues by going through the
changes. And I really ought to spend some time and figure out why
Jaunty will not shut down completely, because that may have contributed
to the problem.

Rich,

Listening to a computer scientist will get you into lots of mischief. 
Plus, he's not disinterested in this matter, as he contributed code to 
the darcs project. (Hi, Jason!)

Subversion will work quite easily without BDB. In fact, I believe 
non-BDB is now the default.

If you still have a copy of your old repo, I'm pretty sure we could 
get it to the point where you could

  1) Dump the old repo
  2) Create a new svn repo that uses the "fsfs" backend (no BDB)
  3) Import the dump into the new repo

Otherwise, it's easy to create a non-BDB subversion repository:

   svnadmin create $SVNROOT --fs-type fsfs

(As I mentioned, I think fsfs is now the default.)

You can backup a fsfs $SVNROOT directly. It will migrate across 
platforms rather easily.

I did try to let Rich know I was biased the first time I recommended
it :) Actually, what became a bigger hurdle is that slackware lacks
packages for ghc (to compile darcs) or darcs itself.

Which leads me to want to make other recommendations, but I don't
think distro recommendations are a good idea across email :)

While I am making too many recommendations... Rich, have you thought
about trying hg?  It's written in python if I recall correctly.  So
maybe that's easier to get on your slackware machine.  I've never used
hg, but I've heard it's easier than git and svn.

Jason

I've been using Mercurial (hg) quite a lot, despite having an initial
preference for git.  (Mercurial seemed to have better windows support
at the time we chose a DVCS, and that's pretty important at work.)

We switched from svn, and I've found that hg works quite well.  I
don't have comparable experience with other DVCSs, but I've found that
I'm *much* more likely to actually use version control as part of my
workflow now that we're using a distributed system.  We really only
used svn as a fancy/robust way to share source code between numerous
people.  It was rare that anyone actually used branches / etc.

I've been quite surprised by how handy it is to push/pull to/from
multiple different repositories.  I generally have two machines
working on development branches, and sharing code (laptop and
desktop), but either one may end up needing to pull/push bits to the
central "stable"(er) repository.

Paul,

   Aha! That's newer than the information in my 2005 Subversion book. Since I
removed the repository and the .svn/ subdirectory in the project directory
before starting over, I'll do the same again, but use the fsfs backend
instead.

   I'll look again at the subversion web site to understand fsfs.

Much appreciated,

Rich

Jason,

   No, I've not seen anything about hg. Subversion is very easy and has
worked well until the BDB issue. I'll restart once again, but without BDB
and that will resolve the issue.

Thanks again,

Paul,

   The svn-1.5 book (pdf version) confirms that fsfs is now the default. With
Subversion-1.0 Berkeley DB was the default, and in version -1.1 the option
of using FSFS was added. I guess I must have used version 1.0 to create the
original repository.

Thanks again,

Rich

I wonder if reinstalling -15 packages would do anything.  Did it ever
work in -15?

Since the kernel downgrade seems to have helped I am wondering if it
has something to do with the kernel handles the graphics subsystem.
I've been reading some bits over the past few months about GEM or some
such that was causing some X bugginess.

Might be worth looking into John.

Last night I finally succeeded in convicting the felon responsible for
the mayhem: pango-graphite. 

Pango-graphite is a utility from the Summer Institute of Linguistics
that is available in Ubuntu repositories. Its function is to enable
"smart" fonts to stack combining diacriticals, among other features
useful to linguists. For example, suppose you needed to write a nasal
tilde mark over a vowel, and also an accent mark at the same time.
Unfortunately, it needs more testing. Following its conviction I sent
it to the Synaptic jail until it can be demonstrated that it has
reformed its behavior. 

The trial consisted of removing a lot of unused applications in a
general housekeeping binge - freed up almost a GB of space. Not only
did I remove a lot of programs that I never use, I also uninstalled a
lot of fonts, and also removed anything to do with fonts unless it was
clearly necessary. One of the removals was pango-graphite. 

After the cleanup I rebooted, but the problem was still not completely
resolved. The -13 kernel did make things better, but the desktop font
was still a bit strange and the mouse still did not work. So I booted
to a Jaunty x86_64 live CD. My intention was to make sure the mouse
worked with the live CD (it did), and then go into Synaptic and write
down every bluetooth utility and library. Then I planned to reboot to
my normal installation, go into Synaptic and remove/install so I would
have exactly the same packages as the live CD. While in the live CD I
also wrote down everything that turned up with a search on 'xorg,'
intending to do the same remove/install back in my normal installation.

Then I rebooted to the -15 kernel. When Ubuntu came up the mouse was
working and the desktop font was normal again. I did not have to
remove/install anything in Synaptic - it "just worked." I have no
explanation for why it was necessary to make a trip through the live CD
before things started working again. I have not bothered with the list
of xorg packages, since the problem appears resolved.

This morning I did have an unnerving experience, indicating that things
may still not be perfect. I opened a bookmark in a new tab in Firefox
and was suddenly staring at a black screen with a bunch of
incomprehensible messages on it - memory addresses, mostly. However, I
ran memtest for 12 hours the other day and there were no errors, so I
doubt it was a physical problem with the RAM. The only clue I could see
was a reference to "kinit." I had installed kubuntu-desktop previously,
so I decided to uninstall it just in case it was the cause of this
latest problem. I couldn't recover from the black screen, so I turned
off the computer and restarted it. The pango-graphite problem never
gave me a black screen, so this is new. If it wasn't the
kubuntu-desktop, then perhaps it was something else I uninstalled.
There are no messages in /var/log/messages. Ubuntu is back up again,
the mouse and desktop font are normal, and I'm keeping my fingers
crossed.

Meantime, if anyone knows what kinit does, it might be useful to know.

It sounds like the kernel gave you a panic screen.  I think kinit is
the kernel's init thread, although I could be mistaken about this.

IIRC, some versions of Firefox are wickedly incompatible with some 
shipping Xorg drivers. I know FF 3.5.1 has the issue, but other 3.5.x 
releases may share the problem.

On the CentOS list, Olaf Mueller suggests some alterations to 
xorg.conf:

kinit is a Kerberos utility. I doubt it's an issue for you.

Subject: [PLUG] Multi IP-camera display - suggestions?
Message-ID: <4854570CA5274EA8B4A5379D94FD754B@tsharplesoffic>

Hello, 

We're trying to figure out a low-cost way to simultaneously display the outputs of up to four different brands (e.g. Axis, Sony, Bosch, etc) of IP cams on a single LCD flatpanel attached to an x-86 Linux workstation. This platform can be anything handy like e.g. a low-end Dell or HP. Each IP cam has an embedded web server that allows you to surf to its IP and see live video, but the underlying mechanisms are very different from one brand to the next. Some require you to download a resource-hungry Java or active-X blob, others merely execute in-line javascript or "streaming ftp", and yet others require a multi-step interactive series of key and mouse clicks to get to a live video screen. 

One way to handle this might be using e.g. curl scripts to deal with the preliminaries, and then opening up four individual browser instances, one for each cam, and assigning their video outputs to one of four quadrants of the screen. But this seems pretty clunky and likely to severely bog down system resources and cause random crashes. Does anyone here have suggestions for a better way to do this?

Thanks,

Tom S.

I'm sending this a 2nd time since for some reason the
1st time I never saw it show up....

[ping test it is now 2:50]

I'm going to upgrade an old HP instruments this winter
and am looking for recommendations on a SBC that will
run Linux.

For those that are curious, the instrument is a HP
8401C Network analyzer. This instrument predated even
GPIB and initially did not have any computer interfaces.
Even when it did, it took a lot of external hardware.
The other instruments are those required to provide a
RF signal sweeper, or synthesizer, relay controllers,
power supplies etc. All of which are GPIB based.
Internally there will be the need to open/close relays,
read switch setting, etc. all of which can be done from
single I/O lines.

Communication via Ethernet, UI will be on a PC.

Device I/O requirements are:

 - RAM Don't know how much, programs will take very
   little, my guess less then 20 MB.

 - Disk. Solid state ?

 - Ethernet 10/100. 1000 Optional

 - Enough Parallel I/O to ..

   - Interface to 4 each 12 bit A/D converters. Data
     rate of a maximum of 200 K samples/second. Can
     be externally buffered with hardware FIFOs.

   - Create a GPIB interface. This interface does not
     have to a full GPIB, nor does it have to be fast.
     Just enough to set listeners such as a RF sweeper,
     synthesizer, relay controllers etc.

   - Interface to various parallel devices. Right now
     16 output lines and 16 inputs are enough. These are
     slow devices.

I/O be interesting to have

I'm going to upgrade an old HP instruments this winter
and am looking for recommendations on a SBC that will
run Linux.

For those that are curious, the instrument is a HP
8401C Network analyzer. This instrument predated even
GPIB and initially did not have any computer interfaces.
Even when it did, it took a lot of external hardware.
The other instruments are those required to provide a
RF signal sweeper, or synthesizer, relay controllers,
power supplies etc. All of which are GPIB based.
Internally there will be the need to open/close relays,
read switch setting, etc. all of which can be done from
single I/O lines.

Communication via Ethernet, UI will be on a PC.

Device I/O requirements are:

 - RAM Don't know how much, programs will take very
   little, my guess less then 20 MB.

 - Disk. Solid state ?

 - Ethernet 10/100. 1000 Optional

 - Enough Parallel I/O to ..

   - Interface to 4 each 12 bit A/D converters. Data
     rate of a maximum of 200 K samples/second. Can
     be externally buffered with hardware FIFOs.

   - Create a GPIB interface. This interface does not
     have to a full GPIB, nor does it have to be fast.
     Just enough to set listeners such as a RF sweeper,
     synthesizer, relay controllers etc.

   - Interface to various parallel devices. Right now
     16 output lines and 16 inputs are enough. These are
     slow devices.

I/O be interesting to have

   - LCD interface on optional board ?

Subject: [PLUG] sqlgrey problems...
Message-ID: <1251760488.14896.29.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I don't know if other people who use sqlgrey with Postfix 
experience problems or not.  My sister has a comcast email 
address, she can't email me when sqlgrey is on.  I try to 
email gblencoe at hydrogendiscoveries.com and he can't 
email me back.  This is even after I white listed the
hydrogendiscoveries.com domain.  I suspect that I need 
to white list the abac.com domain instead.

What are people choosing to do?  I find that grey listing 
doesn't stop spam from coming in.  I still get quite a bit 
of spam.  I've even heard that grey listing might make the
problem worse.  Grey listing is a totally inclusive barrier
that is easy to get around.

Perhaps a smarter approach is to record any unknown source
that is emailing me and if I don't put that source on a 
white list, sqlgrey is applied.  Otherwise, sqlgrey is not
applied even if the source is unknown.  For repeat offenders
who are sending crap you don't want and retrying, they
should be 5xx'ed or better yet tar pitted.

Currently, I have sqlgrey turned off and commented out in my
main.cf.

One way to clean up email, but the people trying to reach you
won't like it, is to send a response with a link to your web
site where they can authenticate their message.  This breaks
the way email works though and for people who are emailing you
for a mailing list, it will be considered extremely rude.

I guess I'm wondering if I need to grey list more aggressively?  
I'm thinking, if I don't white list the email source, then every 
time that source tries to reach me again the grey listing should 
get harsher.  So I start out with a 5 minute delay and work my 
may up to say a 24 hour delay.  I want to be smarter though so 
that the three servers serving my domain are synchronised as to 
the length of the delay.  I'm thinking if you don't wait for the
specified length of time, the delay gets longer.

So in all honesty, does grey listing make the spam problem worse?
Grey listing slows everything down and unfortunately, some legitimate
email sources aren't compatible with delay schemes.  With spammers
retrying, grey listing is totally defeated.  Will delay tactics, short
of black listing, stop spammers?

Like I said, I don't know what to do with sqlgrey so I have turned it
off.

PC Engines (Zurich, CH) makes a line of x86-based SBC called Alix.
There is one with VGA and audio.  All have a CF connector.  4G of CF
is about $10 or so.  As routers, these things are embarrassingly over
capable.  We're seeing CPU utilization percentage in the single digits.

  http://pcengines.ch/alix.htm

Also, Ubiquity has an SBC called RouterStation (and a "Pro" version).
The RouterStation has a bunch of GPIO pins, but not CF.

I/O might be provided by way of USB or one of the other interfaces
available.  Those are the ones I know of.

? ? ? ? ? ? ? Crash Reporting: Mozilla's Open Source Solution

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?by

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? K Lars Lohn

? ? Nothing exercises the limits of software like turning it
? ? over to the end users. While in-house testing is invaluable,
? ? the end users can often find the neglected edge cases or subtle
? ? race conditions in a more reliable manner. However, once the
? ? software is in the end user?s hands, postmortem crash information
? ? is usually lost.

? ? By taking the Google Breakpad project and enhancing it with
? ? Mozilla?s own Socorro project, Mozilla has a solution to this problem.
? ? When Firefox goes down, in a last ditch effort, it lobs a
? ? packet of crash information over the wall to Mozilla's Socorro
? ? servers. ?Socorro Servers, written in Python, can handle millions
? ? of these crashes per day. Using Google Breakpad libraries to
? ? reconstitute useful stack traces, Socorro Server saves its
? ? work in a PostgreSQL database. ?There statistics are gathered
? ? and displayed under the Socorro UI, a PHP web application.
? ? With this suite of tools, the Mozilla developers can track
? ? trends and even drill down to look at specific instances of
? ? Firefox crashes.

? ? WARNING: during this talk, Firefox will be intentionally
? ? crashed live on stage. ?Those of delicate constitution may wish
? ? to retire to the lobby prior to the spectacle.

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? about Lars

? ? Trapped at the triple point between a geek, a hippie and
? ? a biker, Lars is a self proclaimed Cowboy Programmer at the
? ? Mozilla Corporation. ?Unintentionally specializing in programming
? ? as performance art, Lars frequently jumps into projects on the
? ? Thursday prior to a Monday deadline. Lars is proud of being the
? ? only member of the Web Development team that does absolutely
? ? no Web development.

? ? Lars prefers Python, PostgreSQL and Harleys, but is versed in C++,
? ? MySQL and Subarus.

Check out ZoneMinder:

I've played with it a little bit. It's somewhat of a pain to set up but 
it promises to be an extremely flexible solution.
