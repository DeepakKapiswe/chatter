Apparently there is a new (to me at least) GUI backup utility out there
that is supposedly for dummie desktop users. It is inspired by Apple's
Time Machine and Linux Flyback. 

The latest and greatest is apparently 0.926, which I was able to
install easily from the repositories for my Fedora 11 laptop. 

Installing is as far as I got. There is practically no documentation
and the menus in the GUI need a lot of explanation. For example, there
is an Exclude tab, and when I clicked on it I expected to see a list of
folders like /proc and /sys and /tmp. Instead there are things like .*
and *backup* and +~. I am left to guess what these entries do, and why
it did not automatically exclude things that should always be excluded.
There is no explanation of how the pattern matching syntax works.

I could go on about how confusing it is, but I thought I would ask if
anyone else is using it and has information about how to configure it.

Hi John,

I haven't tried this software, but it looks like you need to specify 
exactly what you want backed up on the include tab, and then use the 
exclude tab to filter the files you don't want from those that you 
specified to back up.

Here is the documentation that I found online: 
http://backintime.le-web.org/documentation/

I think you would need to include the root directory('/') before you 
needed to worry about excluding /proc, /sys, and /tmp.

The default patterns appear to filter hidden files (.*), any files with 
the string 'backup' in the file name(*backup*), and any files that have 
a '~' appended to the file name, from the default included directories 
(/home/user/Documents, and /home/user/Pictures).

* I can't imagine why you would want to exclude the dot-files, though. 
It seems like a recipe for disaster if a newbie (like me) needed to 
restore from backup, and didn't realize that they had not backed-up 
their personalized configuration settings (especially the .VirtualBox 
directory).

-Jim

   One day. a long time ago, I accidently deleted all the dot-files in my
home directory. Not only are there a many such files, but the system gets
really upset when they're gone.

   I grabbed the latest full backup tape and restored them all (after working
around the missing files that BRU wanted to see). Major PITA, but an avoided
disaster.

Message-ID: <344543.20066.qm@web50602.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Those who are interested in such applications as Internet telephony will not want to do without sound input. When the AC97 audio chip was built into most motherboards, I never thought about it much, for this chip seems to be fully functional with most OS.

When I obtained a newer computer, the Intel HD onboard audio did not seem to work with a microphone in Linux. The SB X-Fi add-on card that came with it did not work at?all with?Linux until recently, now that Creative has made the driver's source code available. I still haven't heard?from anyone who was able to get microphone input in Linux with such a card.

The black-and-silver USB "Logitech Desktop Microphone" does work with Linux, and because it is a USB device it does not need a battery. it's not very expensive, so I suppose I would recommend it to someone in a situation similar to mine. By the way, has anyone yet obtained microphone input from one of the X-Fi cards?

I was going to give it a shot. I have 145 GB total to back up, and
my backup disk has over 300 GB available, so if it didn't work or I
can't figure out how to restore, I could just nuke it and go back to
rdiff-backup. But after reading the documentation again I think it is
not for me.

I still can't figure out what Back in Time means by a "snapshot." I
know the difference between "full" and "incremental," and I understand
(and appreciate) the way rdiff-backup makes an incremental that looks
like a full backup by creating links to the previous full backup. With
rdiff-backup you can restore the latest version of a file, or any of
the older versions. The Back in Time documentation leads me to believe
it does the same thing. 

Thanks to Jim for the explanation of what the preconfigured exclude
settings mean. I guess I could just nuke them and add my own. I am still
surprised that it did not automatically exclude /proc, /media, /sys
and /tmp. After reading the documentation again I conclude that the
developers assumed that the user would only back up their ~/ folder. I
recall once a long time ago accidentally deleting /bin, so I want the
whole filesystem.

John,

Just for slaps, and giggles, I installed backintime, and gave it a test run.

The application gives the user a simple way to revert changes to their 
files based on a point in time (Snapshot). It seems like it is useful as 
a document/file revision tool more than anything else, which explains 
their default choices for what to backup. (I had a real DUH! moment when 
I came to that conclusion, and looked at the title of the application 
again...)

I suppose you could use it for system backups, but I think that 
(out-of-the-box) it isn't really designed for that purpose, and wouldn't 
be any better as a backup tool than the many other options, like the 
ones on this page:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem

My personal preference is to simply backup my user data, and restore it 
on a fresh installation when I bork my system (not if, WHEN). This way, 
I know I am starting clean... I do the same with Windows, too.

When I restore my home folder, I move all of the regular files to my new 
home directory, but selectively restore the dot-files, and directories, 
as needed.

-Jim

P.S. Thanks for creating this conversation. You just reminded me that I 
need to get some backups going on this system. I have my /home folder on 
a separate partition, but that won't do me any good if the disk dies.

   FWIW, Dirvish does this and it's very useful as a backup tool. Files (or
filesystems) can be restored for any time where the snapshot diff is still
stored. Similar to rdiff-backup, I assume.

   Dirvish uses the hierarchy of a bank (one per machine if that's your
preference), and vaults for each partition/filesystem in that bank/machine.
I have one bank and 12 vaults, one for each partition on the two hard drives
except for /tmp. I've not yet had to restore a file, but the process runs as
a cron job every night, just after midnight.

   If rdiff-backup is working for John, he should stick with it and learn to
use it fully for his needs.

Good advice.

Dirvish sounds like overkill for someone like me. Actually, so does 
backintime, and rdiff-backup!

I'm a cp -ruv kind of guy! :) That being said, I think I might try out 
simplebackup.

I have used Back-in-time and it is designed to be like Apple's Time
Machine.  Once it takes the original snapshot and copies all of those files,
any later snapshots only copy files that are different and creates Hard
Links to the rest.  This means that you can look at/restore any snapshot and
it is a complete backup as of that time.  By using hard links, it saves a
lot of space and you can delete any old backups without disturbing any of
the other ones.

Thanks for the reminder, it's time for me to make another snapshot of my
system... :)

That's what rdiff-backup does too, either from the command line or via
the Pybackpack GUI. 

There must be some difference, else why create Back in Time?

Jim,

   While dirvish can take some attention and time to set up exactly as you
want, there are multiple benefits for "someone like you." :-)

   I've used tape backup systems since the mid-1980s, and once I got onto the
Tandburg SLR drives and tapes in 2000 there's never been a glitch. However
for my SLR-60 (30G uncompressed/60G compressed) the tapes cost at least $72
each, and I used 3 at a time (two for alternating weekly full backups and
one for daily incremental backups). Tapes last me about 4-5 years, and I
needed to replace them a couple of months ago. The cost and limited capacity
drove me to dirvish instead. I bought a nominal 300G hard drive and a USB2
case at ENU for $81, just over the cost of a single tape. I'm now keeping my
daily snapshots for 2 weeks and the Sunday backups for 4 weeks. That's
plenty for me.

   Since dirvish runs as a cron job, you can schedule the backups as
infrequently as you wish, and set the expiration for whatever time leaves
you comfortable. After an initial exact copy of each filesystem (partition)
with hardlinks, each night's run copies to the backup drive only the file
changes made that day. So, if I really screw up a file I can restore it to
whatever state I want up to 2 weeks. I've never needed more than the last
version of a file.

   Backups are insurance: we hope we never need them, but are grateful we
have them if the need arises.

Rich

Message-ID: <1265081824.4542.20.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I am wondering what my Pentium II 300 server system with the monitor 
off most of the time is drawing power wise?  I'm thinking 190 watts 
is probably the max because I googled and that is apparently what a
K6-2 300 system draws.  What is the best way for this Linux based
computer to post it's average power consumption via an Apache based 
web site?  This system has two Compaq 4G MA4039LP scsi drives, an
Adaptec 2940U2W, a scsi cdrom that is almost never used, a Thunderlan
dual nic, an Intel ISA PCMCIA card, and an ATI Rage 128 RF/SG AGP video
card.  Don't know how much power the memory consumes, but I have 2 128
meg PC66 DIMMs.  I also have a cheap USB Logitech color Quickcam.  A
cheap PS/2 mouse and keyboard are plugged in, but they are almost never
used.

Is there a hardware product that I can plug in between the wall 
and the power strip that feeds this computer which will report 
the power consumption to Linux via a USB or ethernet port?  The
only thing that readily comes to mind is getting an APC Smart UPS.
I have one that doesn't work right, don't know why.

I would like a cheap amp meter that I can plug in inline between any
15/20 amp AC device and a wall outlet.  Obviously, it would be nice
if this amp meter has Linux compatible output capabilities.

Actually, it would be nice if I could meter the circuit that this server
is on in isolation.

The kill-a-watt is very easy to use and a standard.

Message-ID: <20100202011453.5385c661@mailhost.pdx.edu>

OK, rdiff-backup is failing me. It worked fine when I had Ubuntu
Jaunty, but now that I have Fedora 11 it will not run. That is, I have
a script to back up / to a folder mounted
at /media/Backups/Full_system_backup_Fedora, but when I try to run the
script it throws a page of incomprehensible error messages. The same
script (modified now for Fedora) worked fine before.

I thought I might fall back to using the pybackpack GUI, but it refuses
to allow me to specify / as the source. It defaults to ~/ and that
seems to be hard coded. I never had this problem with pyabackpack on
Jaunty, so maybe I now have a different version. On Jaunty I had no
problem telling pybackpack to back up /, subject to an excludes list.

My script is:

#!/bin/bash
sudo rdiff-backup
--include-globbing-filelist /home/jjj/rdiff_excludes.txt / /media/Backups/Full_system_backup_Fedora
2> /home/jjj/rdiff-errors.txt sudo rdiff-backup
2> --list-increment-sizes /media/Backups/Full_system_backup_Fedora
2> > /home/jjj/rdiff-stats.txt

When I run the script I get:

Sorry that came out badly formatted. 

There is not one line of the above errors that means anything to anyone
other than the original developers of rdiff-backup. Unless there is
someone here, that is. If so, please translate for me. 

Frustrated because now my backup has to wait.

Dumb question, but is the username that you're using in the group that 
has the
correct permissions?

Yes, the user name is in the user group. The device can be operated by
the user using other programs, just minicom complains about a lockfile.

Hmm, this is pretty straightforward. This sounds more like a bug.
You could try running the command with 'strace' and see if that provides
any insight.

You say it worked before and now it doesn't? In that scenario, 1st 
question I
ask myself is what changed.

I found this thread that talks about how sometimes the rdiff-backup-data 
directory can become corrupt due to a failed run. The author provides a 
script that checks for a valid increment before attempting a backup.

Ok I found out what it was with starce. The programs lockfile could not
be made with the default location so I just changed the location of the
file to the home dir & the problem went away. TFYH.

John,

   When you successfully ran rdiff-backup before, what python version was
installed? If it was 2.5, you may be trying to run Main.py created under
that version with your new 2.6 version of python.

   Go to whereever you have rdiff-backup. It looks like it is a series of
python scripts. There should be a file named 'setup.py' in that directory.
If so, as root (sudo or su -c) run 'python setup.py install' within that
directory.

   The above rebuilds the python installation using python-2.6 and installs
that version in python2.6/site-packages/.

   When I upgrade the system and the python version changes I have to
recompile and re-install all my python applications and tools to work with
the new release.

   Most likely a python version change. Those errors shown are generated by
the python interpreter.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1002020631470.17734@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My wife tells me that she cannot check the spelling of email messages she
writes using seamonkey on xubuntu-9.10. My Google searches tell me that the
spelling checker is automatically installed. I would appreciate a pointer or
two on where to look to turn it on.

TIA,

   Working with folks on the seamonkey mail list I've isolated the problem.
When the spell checker finds a mis-spelled word the dialog box appears, but
it's totall blank. No mis-spelled word, no suggestions. Wierd.

   Apparently part of the seamonkey problem here (or all of the problem) is
that xubuntu-9.10 installs seamonkey-1.1.17 and there's a -2.x version
available that fixes a bunch of problems.

   When I look in the synaptic package manager on the laptop I see that
seamonkey-1.1.17 is considered the latest version and there's no obvious
offer to look for a newer package.

   What's the technique for getting a newer package for a specific
application?

I found Ubuntuzilla.sourceforge.net, which lists a repository containing 
Seamonkey 2.0.2

As with many mozilla projects, they don't offer an official repository 
for installable packages at http://www.seamonkey-project.org.

A quick google took me to ubuntuzilla, which i'd completely forgotten about.

http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/ubuntuzilla/index.php?title=Main_Page

the installation instructions require a bit of 
copy-command-string-and-paste-into-terminal, but that's preferable to 
manually installing a tarball and setting the Applications menu.

Larry,

   Thank you. A Google search indirectly lead me to the same place and I
figured out how to add the repository. It's downloading now.

It was whatever was installed in Jaunty. But my Fedora 11 computer was
a fresh install on a brand new hard disk. I don't recall installing
python, but I do recall manually installing rdiff-backup. Python was
installed either during Fedora 11 installation or as a dependency for
rdiff-backup, or perhaps as a dependency for some other application
that I installed.

It could be that the initial installation of Fedora 11 installed an
older version of python and then I installed 2.6 as an update. I do
install all updates as soon as the Update Software utility announces
them. I don't actually recall an update for python, but it could have
happened. That might have left me with a python that is incompatible
with my current version of rdiff-backup.

This sounds promising, but I can't find setup.py in the rdiff-backup
folder:

[jjj at Devil8 ~]$ locate rdiff
/usr/bin/rdiff-backup
/usr/bin/rdiff-backup-statistics
/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/rdiff_backup
	<within this folder are the scripts>

Although I think I have found the folder with the scripts, there is no
setup.py script. I read through them and there is no other script that
sounds like its purpose is to install or set up rdiff-backup.

If I do "locate setup.py" I get ten different setup.py files. All are in
subfolders of /usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/numpy/, and none sound
as though they have anything to do with rdiff-backup.

I used yum to uninstall rdiff-backup, then reinstalled it, but that
didn't help.

I also perused the rdiff-backup web page and wiki, but didn't find
anything. Most of the questions and answers there relate to really old
versions of rdiff-backup and python.

Still stuck. :(

Larry/Joe:

   Now that the upgrade's installed it's balking at sending a message. The
error it reports is that the smtp server doesn't support SMTP_AUTH, which it
does (since I run that here) and I've not changed anything since it worked
with the seamonkey-1.1.17.

   I don't want to disable 'use name and password' unless that's not opening
a huge security hole for her outgoing messages.

   Advice?

   Or, a version of rdiff-backup that's incompatible with the latest python.

   Should be associated with rdiff-backup.

   No, you don't want NumPy (that's a numeric package for mathematics using
python).

   I don't know anything about rdiff-backup, but the error messages you first
reported looked to me like python version issues. Perhaps someone more clued
than I can help.

   Er, I deleted the last message on the thread too soon. I just noticed,
John, that you were looking for the setup.py in
python2.6/site-packages/rdiff-backup. That's the wrong directory. Those are
the scripts that are installed by setup.py.

   Can you find where the basic, uninstalled rdiff-backup files are located?
If you're installing it from a package I don't know how to resolve the
issue.

   Fixed it. It changed the port from 110 to 465. As soon as I changed the
port back to the correct one it sent the pending message.

   Actually, I didn't fix it with that port. It wants port 25 (no surprise
there, really) and no authentication. Hmm-m. That affects only her outgoing
mail so there may not be any associated security issue.

There is not a security issue.. as long as you're at home. SMTP-AUTH is all
about your SMTP server allowing people outside the local network to send
mail through it. If your wife travels at some point, she may not be able to
send mail while away from home.

   Thanks, Wes. I'll give her a note about changing that if she uses her

I installed both python and rdiff-backup from the Fedora 11
repositories with Yumex. I don't know if there are "basic, uninstalled
rdiff-backup files."

It does sound logical to me that your suggestion is correct - that is,
there is a compatibility issue between python and rdiff-backup.

In one of the rdiff-backup folders I did find a README file that says:

---------------
INSTALLATION:
Thank you for trying rdiff-backup.  To install, run:
	python setup.py install
The build process can be also be run separately:
	python setup.py build
The default prefix is generally /usr, so files would be put in /usr/bin,
/usr/share/man/, etc.  An alternate prefix can be specified using the
--prefix=<prefix> option.  <snipped>
------------------

The problem is the first line "python setup.py install." In English
"install" is a transitive verb, that is, it requires a direct object
argument. I.e., install *something*. Presumably I should make the
command say "python setup.py install rdiff-backup," but I need to be in
the right directory first. And I can't find the right directory. 

I think I am subscribed to the rdiff-backup mailing list, so I am going
to ask there. Or maybe I'll take it to the Fedora forums instead/also.

John,

   Don't they insist on fluency in computer in a linguistics program? The
above command is telling python to install what it finds in setup.py; in
your case, rdiff-backup. The README you quoted also told you that you could
build the executable (i.e., compile it) but not install the executable in
/usr/bin by issuing the command 'python setup.py build' instead of 'python
setup.py install'. Both are reflectsive commands. Self-referential, if you
will.

   No, don't change the command. The python install tools are smart enough to
read what's in setup.py. Trust it; it works. There's a different setup.py
for each python package you install, and each is specific to that tool.

   With the latest python installed with fedora-11, try uninstalling
rdiff-backup and reinstalling. I don't know if the fedora package is
pre-built or has the source. If there's a source rpm for rdiff-backup that
might be the one to use. Shrug. Too many years since I ran Red Hat.

Isn't that what they did? Engineer the software to execute faster? You 
make what they did sound like an elementary hack.

I think he's referring to the fact that they're still using PHP which
plenty of people seem to dislike because it's had so many security
flaws and because too often newbies just write code without thinking
of the consequences and open more security holes.

That said, I checked the dev blog post and it does look like it's
pretty interesting.

Now I am not sure the problem is with python/rdiff-backup
incompatibility. I just installed pybackpack, which is a GUI front end
for rdiff-backup. As I write this it is happily making a backup. The
only problem is that it does not allow me to access all the
possibilities and features of rdiff-backup from the command line. For
example, it can exclude only whole folders, not files based on wild
cards. I have a lot of distro ISOs scattered around and it would be
silly to back them up, so my script excludes *.iso.

As soon as the backup finishes I'll try running the script again. Maybe
there really was an incompatibility issue and the installation of
pybackpack fixed it.

Thank you, that was exactly where I was going, except I was thinking
about the efficiency of the language, not the n00bs that use it.
Writing a monster website with zillions of users in any interpreted
language seems silly to me. Fixing it by making PHP a compiled
language is one way to solve the problem, I guess. A simpler solution
might have been to translate the codebase to a compiled language. Even
simpler yet would have been to do so a long time ago, or even start
there.

Excuse my ignorance on the matter, but what makes a
interpreted language inherently less appropriate for a web site like FB, 
and
a compiled language inherently more appropriate. I'm not asking for a full
scholarly redress, but just a summary of the key points...

it's not strictly a compiled vs. interpreted issue, but the general rule is
that compiled languages are usually able to do the same operations as an
interpreted language much faster.

there is another general rule that the usability of a given language is
inversely proportional to its performance. in other words, they slow things
way down so that newbies can compete more quickly. This is entirely
appropriate for a new endeavor. There are exceptions to both statements, of
course. What people (business people, mostly) don't understand is that at a
certain point, you have to tear down and start over.

That is essentially what Facebook has done, except instead of rebuilding
their building, they rebuilt the foundation and the whole block around it
while the building itself was still standing. That way, they didn't have to
send their people home while they rebuilt. The analogy here is that if they
switched languages altogether, they'd have to fire all their PHP coders and
hire coders for whatever they switched to.

An interpreted language does all the work of translating the
high-level, complex, abstract programming statements written in a
human-readable language into machine code (the only kind of code a
computer can _actually_ execute) at runtime, right when a result is
needed. A compiled language translates the human-written source code
into machine code beforehand, so that at runtime the computer can
execute the ready-made machine code hell-bent-for-leather.

There is an in-between compromise called bytecode. Languages like java
and C# are not compiled into directly executable machine
code. Instead, they are compiled into a form that is still interpreted
at runtime, but it is highly optimized to interpret very
quickly. These languages use a virtual machine, or "runtime", to
"execute" the bytecode. What the runtime actually does is read
segments of bytecode and compile them into real machine code on the
fly, the results generally not being stored on disk. This is where we
get the term "Just In Time Compilation", or JIT.

An interpreted language will always run more slowly than a compiled
language because of all the extra work that has to be done at
runtime. There may be some oddball cases like TinyBasic, but we're
talking about high-level application programming languages here.

Lovely clear explanation, Carlos. The only thing i'd add is the 
relatively recent addition of support for typically interpreted 
languages (e.g., Python, Ruby) on both the Java Virtual Machine and the 
.NET Common Language Runtime. This approach is a great middle ground 
that provides the usability/development efficiency of higher-level 
"scripting" languages with the performance of bytecode compilation and 
the safety/security/sandboxing (somewhat debatable but generally better 
than the default interpreters) of the JVM and CLR. In larger 
enterprises, this approach also allows standard deployment and 
management (i.e. as .NET or Java EE applications) on existing server 
infrastructure - the operations teams don't need to deal with another 
platform, even though the application code is written in JRuby or Iron 
Python.

Given that CPU cycles are far cheaper than developers and operations 
staff, the productivity/performance tradeoff of higher-level languages 
is a no-brainer for most businesses.

BTW, your initial remark, "don't engineer your software better, instead 
make your crap execute faster. Oracle might be interested in this," had 
me laughing out loud.

I haven't paid much attention to jython and clojure. But your argument
is a compelling one. It lets a free spirit like me use the language I
like without giving the pointy-haired boss having much reason to
complain about it. Python has its delights for a programmer, and ruby
too, and it would be nice to see them run fast.

Lisp already compiles to machine code if you use SBCL or CMUCL, so
there's no performance gain to be had. But the ability to deploy it
like a java app is good for the server admin. I should have thought of
this at my last job, where I deployed lisp code on a custom-built
gentoo box. That did not make me any friends.

   I just discovered Cython. This is the tight integration of C with Python
that provides several benefits. It allows C functions to be directly called
by python modules and, important for me, it will compile portions of code
into shared libraries that can be called by python functions.

   The latter speeds up CPU-bound computations and provides the algorithmic
security of compiled code.

   Cython is heavily used with NumPy, SciPy, Octave, and SAGE (a FOSS
replacement for Mathematica and other symbolic math applications).

   I've had locale set as 'C' for a long time. When I changed it to something
different (e.g., en_US.utf-8) some displays were incorrect. (I don't recall
which ones because it's been a while.) Anyway, ...

   I would like to use a locale that displays accented characters in alpine
messages. In ~/.bash_profile I exported LANG=en_US.utf-8, then sourced the
file. The collation order remained 'C', but all other variables were
changed.

   Is this the locale I want to use?

TIA,

I usually do

LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="C"

I get the old-fashioned ASCII sort ordering, can still get unicode in 
terminal windows, etc.

This is my complete set of locale environment variables:

LANG=german
LC_CTYPE=de_DE.utf8
LC_MESSAGES=de_DE.utf8
LC_PAPER=de_DE.utf8
GDM_LANG=de_DE.utf8

To make it appropriate for English, I think you'd want to do the
following (note the difference with LANG):

LANG=en_US.utf8
LC_CTYPE=en_US.utf8
LC_MESSAGES=en_US.utf8
LC_PAPER=en_US.utf8
GDM_LANG=en_US.utf8

I guess I don't set LC_COLLATE; perhaps I better had.

Paul,

   Does it matter if it's "UTF-8" or "utf-8"?

I believe the answer is Neither. It should be utf8.

Carlos,

   Oh. I tried to find a list of all acceptable locales, but what I found in
/usr/share/locals/ was en_US with no code page modifiers.

Hmm. I thought the official designation for the charmap in question 
was UTF-8.

In any event, I'm just going by what Red Hat and Debian set as their 
default (for en_US environments).

Paul/Carlos:

   I've no idea if case or hyphens make a difference. I'll wait for an
incoming mail list message from a European and see if the accented
characters properly display (instead of a '?' being shown). If necessary
I'll futz with the specifics.

Many thanks guys!

You may need to specify a proper font for all the characters to appear.
I use Claws Mail and I just set it to UTF-8 and everything shows up. I
don't know what font it's using, but I'm sure it's something open
source.

   Well, I'm half-way there.

   In alpine's Setup -> Config (which changes ~/.pinerc) I modified the
Display Character Set from ANSI-X-1968 to ISO-8859-1. That allowed me to
view the above message correctly.

   However, when I respond (and alpine's running in a rvxt virtual console),
the quoted lines do not correctly display.

   A-ha! When ispell checks the message before sending the accented
characters are OK. Ergo, it's the way the editor (joe) displays them. So,
now to find how to set joe's default character set.

I finally nailed the problem.

It was my excludes.txt file. I had added a folder and two wildcard
file patterns for the ISOs -

- /Azureus Downloads
- *.iso
- *.ISO

It was puking on the patterns for the ISOs. When I removed them from the
excludes.txt file the script ran just fine.

Now, why did it throw a page of incomprehensible error messages that
led us to think there was a problem with python? Why couldn't it just
say "hey dumbass, what the hell am I supposed to do with *.iso and
*.ISO?" Now that's an error message that I could have understood. C'mon
programmers, speak human, 'k? Sheesh.

As an aside, the statistics file it created tells me it took 112
minutes to back up 145 GB from my 7200 RPM SATA drive to the 5400 RPM
SATA drive in the Ultrabay. That's about 1.3 GB per minute. Not bad.

Signo de interrogaci?n inicial. But you didn't complain about ?, signo
de admiraci?n inicial. 

Anyway, "letra" does not mean exactly the same as English "letter." It
includes the meaning of English "character." It even includes "lyrics,"
as to a song.

I'm having a hard time figuring out what the market is like right now.
I'm looking for a PCI card or I suppose a USB based tuner will also
work.  Of course, I want a card that works with Linux.  I have a 
Play Station II that I want to hook up to the computer.  I guess the
alternative is finding a Play Station II emulator.  Is there a local
business that understands Linux which can hook me up with the ideal
HDTV tuner card in the $20-$50 range?  It looks like I want to avoid
Geniatech.  I don't know about ATI tuner cards, my dad has thrown one
out because it didn't work.

I have had very good luck with the ATI cards. Many years ago I had
problems with one, back when you had to compile GATOS yourself. I
never could seem to get the settings quite right. Once they had GATOS
as part of the regular x.org my troubles went away. I've used both an
ATI 128 Rage Pro All-In-Wonder and an ATI All-In-Wonder Radeon 8500DV
with excellent results. (Both were AGP, though.)

I've now also used a couple of Hauppauge video input cards with good
results. A WinTV Go PCI and very recently a Hauppauge 1196 WinTV
HVR-1250 PCI Express, though I guess I don't actually know how well
that one works yet. I just trust it because it's Hauppauge.

As an aside, has anyone gotten video recording to work? I know that
with Myth I can do it, but I want a stand-alone solution, more like
TV-Time. I know they say that if you build it yourself you can enable
recording, but I could never get the settings quite right.

Howdy.
I'm making a big sign for my wife's work (Concentrates, Inc. which sells
animal feeds and organic fertilizers down by SE 8th and Powell), and I suck
at lettering.  Any chance anyone has a video projector I could borrow today
to project a design on the sign and trace over it?

Will trade animal feed, organic soil amendments or beer.  Will pick 
up/return in Portland Metro area.

Sorry for off-topicness but I will be using Linux throughout,

Which was true in the 70s, and has no applicability today.  Please
stop perpetuating the myth.

However, yes, in this case, the WTF is they're still using PHP. :)

I don't have a projector, but I have a question: How big is "big"? I
ask because my initial reaction is to just design the sign in something
like Scribus and then print it on something that will do large media.
For example, I know there are color plotters that will do at least 42
inches wide by 150 feet long, and perhaps larger widths are available.
I know they have a few in the computer labs at PSU and I've seen
students printing to them.

Free Geek also popped into mind. Perhaps they have a projector or
something else that will get the job done.

   Er, ... may we disagree about this issue? Many of the python functions in
mathematical libraries such as NumPy and SciPy are re-written in Cython.
Cython produces C code that is compiled to shared libraries for speed of
execution.

   I suspect that we're both correct, Randal, depending on the application.
Those that tend to be I/O bound probably run as quickly when interpreted as
when compiled, but serious number crunching tends to be CPU-bound and
compilation makes a big difference.

Wait a minute! This is news to me. Are you saying that an interpreted 
program runs as fast as a compiled program?

   That's a good solution. Using Scribus or Inkscape will work because they
use stroked fonts which are scalable (PostScript). Any commercial Kinko's or
equivalent should be able to print a submitted .pdf to the desired size.

With one caveat: I've tried to do this before and they wouldn't scale
anything without charging extra for their office staff in changing
stuff. It was a hefty charge, too. But they would print out anything
that would fit on their printers and was already set to the right size
in the file that you take them.

So just find out what their maximum capacity is and set up the file
beforehand. For some reason I went in there with a file set up for
large paper, but not to their max, since I didn't know what that was
and I thought that they could just issue a command to scale it up,
like a copier can automatically do, but no dice.

The highly-anticipated Jeri Ellsworth talk is in severe jeopardy this
month (this evening), as she is sick and not feeling up to it.  I am
in the process of trying to find someone to fill-in on the same
general topic on very short notice.  We'll reschedule Jeri for a
future meeting.

In a pinch, I can talk about the SkyPilot status (we just signed an
agreement with the City to receive getting 80 + maybe 600 more of
the remnants of the defunct MetroFi network).  Or maybe someone else
has a more exciting topic.

The short version is: If you were planning to come tonight to
specifically see the amazing Jeri Ellsworth, put your enthusiasm on
hold and watch this space.  We may have something else worth your
enthusiasm in the next hour or two.  Or maybe not.  Please standby.

Thanks.

I could come out and give a presentation on implementing PID loops in
software.  The only problems with this are:

1.  The only thing specifically "Linux" about it is the laptop
    it's on.

2.  It has been about a year since I gave the talk so the slide
    ordering would sometimes be as much a surprise to me as to you,

3.  And I'm not nearly as good looking.

But if you can overcome that, I can come babble at you for an hour or 90
minutes about implementing control loops in software.

This isn't something I have worked on for awhile, but at last check,  
Pinnacle makes PCI cards for TV tuning and PVRs that work with a  
number of popular Linux distros.

Make sure you get one that can do HDTV. For your price range, I don't  
think it's likely. Pay more now, and it'll last you longer, IMHO.

As for your PlayStation 2, if the card has a secondary video input  
(for VCR or camcorder, or something), you could connect it to that. In  
my case, back a few years ago, I didn't use it. I opted to connect my  
XBOX to the video input on my monitor, and switched to that input when  
I wanted to play console games.

Here's another option. A friend of mine used a prior model of this

Absolutely agree with Wes. There are a host of commonly-used
interpreted languages today that are slow because they are
interpreted. BASH, perl, python, ruby, javascript, vbscript. Are more
examples needed? Let's see the list of counterexamples. FB is making
their PHP run faster by compiling it. Why would they do that if the
slowness of their interpreted language, and the benefit gained by
compiling it, is a myth?

It looks like we are going to try to have a DorkBot PDX demo night
instead.  We have one offer, one maybe, I have a little something, and
have put out a call for others to demo something as well.

To learn more about DorkBotPDX, see:

It's more hardware-y than PLUG is used to, but (I like to think) in a

You're both wrong, but I'm not going to waste my time trying to convince
you otherwise.

The speed of a language has very little to do with "interpreted" or
"compiled".  There's a lot more going on, far more variables than that, like
whether the language has early or late binding, or expensive flexible data
types.

That's the myth I'm talking about.

For example, bash's slowness is because it has to do a lot of forking.
Nothing to do with "interpreted".  I could go down that list and explain each
one of those.

But I won't, because you've already made up your mind.

The fact that even after converting PHP to C++ only sped up the results by a
factor of *2* should be ringing alarms at this point.  It's *NOT* the
language.  It's *not* whether it's interpreted or compiled.

Besides, these days, we should be talking "results per programmer hour",
because that's the most expensive part of the equation.

It's the *real* reason Facebook is still coding in PHP, and not C++.  (Even
though I think PHP was a bad choice.)

I admit that I labor under the myth (and I imagine that a significant
portion of the population of programmers and SwEng managers do, too), but I
am intrigued by Randal's thesis.  Some pointers to literature on the subject
would be most welcome. (Never let it be said, however, that I would want to
put the kibosh on what is shaping up to be a lively discussion).

I did state that "it's not strictly a compiled vs. interpreted issue" - you
are just re-explaining what I said. I am aware that a language being
interpreted does not make it slow, nor does compiling make it fast.
Nonetheless, most of the languages that are interpreted perform more slowly
than most of the languages that are compiled. With of course, no shortage of
exceptions.

This doesn't make sense to me. Different languages implement the same
features and functions in different ways. Some of them are more efficient
for a given application than others. I realize I'm speaking in gross

Every one of those interpreters is/was written in C and compiled into 
machine code.  If your compiled program is going to do the same amount 
of work as the interpeter, it becomes the interpreter (definitions 
being what they are and such.)

If you can take a shortcut by dropping a bunch of features from your 
runtime, of course the resultant machine code will be faster.  The 
engineering decision is simply about how long it takes you to code that 
shortcut vs what it's worth at runtime.

Meanwhile, vast quantities of XS extensions are available on the CPAN 
(e.g. dbi, expat, libusb, libgsl, wx, gtk, qt) which let you run the 
heavy lifting through some compiled machine code (at the expense of a 
bit of marshalling overhead) while you happily write more expressive 
code without worrying about memory allocation or buffer overflows.

You can generalize about compiled vs interpreted but it really doesn't 
count for much by the time you pile 100 other trade-offs into the 
decision.

>Let's see the list of counterexamples.

Your unoptimized regular expression engine vs Perl's is an easy one.  
I'll grant that most of the others are hard to win on time benchmarks. 
And that's fine if you get infinite time to write code, debug it, 
maintain it, and have zero cost for downtime or security breaches.  
Spherical horserace in a vacuum and all that.

It's always faster to do less work.  For the machine, there are cases 
where you can accomplish this without giving up the expressiveness and 
dynamic code.  Some JIT work promises to outrun naively compiled C 
because it can examine a running loop to e.g. remove several 
conditionals.  There are more and more shades of gray between compiled 
and interpreted as time goes on.

From what I've read about the facebook php, they're simply caching 
another step in the process.  Interesting tech, but probably vastly 
different in lifetime cost compared to rewriting everything in C++.

"Myth" isn't the right word to describe the typical gross over- 
simplification of comparing dynamic/static interpreted/compiled code, 
but bugs per KSLOC and SLOC/day/developer are still very cruel 
constants.

If you're interested in the shades of gray and some pretty nifty stuff 
happening in the world of VMs, please join us next week at pdx.pm for 
an introduction to parrot.  http://pdx.pm.org/  :-D

Unless there is some weird translation going on in the print server, I 
would think they would be OS agnostic. Having said that:

Last time I was there, FreeGeek Thrift Store had a Ethernet USB print
server for $10.  I was tempted to get it, but my (Linux-based) DNS-323 NAS
makes a dandy USB print server, and I didn't want to be greedy.

There are 2 kinds of USB print servers.  The regular print-only ones work
very well with Linux (most support LPR, even) but the ones meant for
multifunction printers (i.e. print/scan/FAX) don't work with Linux.

The MFP USB servers are very interesting, by the way- they act as a bridge
for full bidirectional USB traffic, over TCP/IP.  I'd love to find a way to
make mine work with Linux.  Webcam anywhere, anyone?

Message-ID: <f77f05331002050928i584649fdt3732a81c1574b7d2@mail.gmail.com>

I have found this debate fascinating. However, I am not a developer - but
aspire to move in that direction. I forwarded some of this debate to a
couple of developer friends of mine and here are their thoughts:

*From Matt*:
I've tested perl programs before, same program ran through an interpreter,
and then same program ran as compiled machine code. And the compiled version
wasn't just 2 times faster, it was WAY faster...but I can't remember by what
factor.

You know FORTRAN was the first compiled language, and it's specialty was
scientific applications.  ALGOL was another early language, and it had
dynamic arrays.  Lots of language that have come after ALGOL all use static
sized arrays, and this was just a decision to make things faster with the
static version.

COBOL was designed for business reports in mind.  And there have been many
more.

But C, was specifically designed for *system programming*, UNIX comes to
mind.  So C compiled, is still the faster gun in the West, and was designed
for Operating Systems.

Also there is another type of language, the Hybrid.  C# is a hybird - not
interpreted or compiled.  Because it compiles into bytecode, which is like
intermediate code.

*From Patrick*:
I agree with Matt that typically interpreted code is slower, however, I
agree with the guys below as well.  It depends on what you are doing.  For
example, if you are writtng an IO intensive program, most of your time will
be spent waiting on IO (network or disk) and thus the savings probably are
not worth it to use C.  If you are writing just client network applications
who cares.  Get it done and make money wins.  :)  If you are writing a new
OS or a database then you definitely should do it in a native language to
maximize performance and scalability, but, very few software companies do
this now.  We rely on this work being done by a few other companies.  Of
course this causes all types of problems with platform compatiblity.  If you
are talking about multi user web based database applications most of the
time is spent in your sql queries or network latency.  Better to optimize
your queries and indexes than write it in C.  For exmaple, my company
started with ASP scripting language the program was built in - interpreted
with little caching help.  We are currently slowly moving to asp.net with a
compiled (bytecode - using vb.net and c#) but we do not notice speed
improvements in this code nearly as much as we do by optimizing our
database, increasing our backbone bandwidth and speed, removing redundant
internet or database calls, etc.

I'm hoping to get a USB based tuner, but it looks like these are more
than $99 a piece.  I like the Linux compatible notion, but I worry
that it won't work in Windows.  I'm in a tight spot, I have a Windows
machine that I can't just run Linux on because it is meant for Windows
programs that don't work in Linux like Minitab for example.  On the
other hand, I want a tuner for this machine because there is no room
to drop in a small television.  I suppose I can dual boot the machine
to get around the needing Linux for the tuner issue, but if the tuner
is PCI based and causes a problem with Windows, I won't be able to
unplug it to run Windows.  I like the idea of being portable also as
this machine isn't in a good place for me to hook up my play station.
If the mentioned site had a USB 2 version that works in Linux and
Windows XP, that would be much more attractive.  I want a Linux
compatible tuner for this Linux based P4 desktop system I'm typing
up this email on that is also Windows XP compatible for the other
system.

Thus spake S. Michael Convey circa 10-02-05 09:28 AM:
> I have found this debate fascinating. However, I am not a developer - but
> aspire to move in that direction. I forwarded some of this debate to a
> couple of developer friends of mine and here are their thoughts:

Just be aware that the rhetoric is based on a false dichotomy between
"interpreted" vs. "compiled".  All languages, including C, are a little
bit interpreted and all languages, including PHP, are a little bit
compiled.  The only difference is where one draws the line between human
and computer.  I.e. the real spectrum behind the false dichotomy is the
extent to which there's an isomorphism between the source code and the
machine instructions.

An interpreted language simply hooks compiled units together with human
readable glue, which is also compiled.  A compiled language doesn't have
any human readable sentences in it.  But the extent to which a language
is compiled matters quite a bit.  C is compiled all the way down to the
machine level.  But even then, there are gray areas like inlining vs.
function calls and branch prediction.  Both function calls and branch
prediction can be loosely considered a form of "interpretation".

So, as Randall and Eric point out, doing more work takes more time.
Regardless of how you get there (interpreted or compiled), if it's
isomorphic to the machine code, your program will be fast.  If it's full
of sugar that makes it easier for humans to use and grok, then your
program will be slow.

A more useful discussion would consist of use-cases that require the
dynamism of interpreted languages, use-cases that require the
determinism of compiled languages, and use-cases that require a healthy
mix of the two.

Relating this back to gnu/Linux, it seems that the unix philosophy of
building large libraries of small and focused utilities that are
composed to accomplish complex tasks tends more toward the interpretive
side of the (false) dichotomy.  Windows seemed to have initially adopted
the monolithic attitude of hiding everything behind the curtain.  (We're
talking about "seeing into the machine", here.)  This is evident even in
things like window managers.  In windows, you get 1.  In gnu/linux you
get... well, lots of choices and the ability to build your own hybrid.

Apple seems to have graduated away from the monolithic approach with
their adoption of unix; but they maintain the idea that choice is a bad
(or at least confusing) thing and hide the power of unix behind a
translucent curtain.  I think they've done a GREAT service to their user
base, which consists of a smooth spectrum of types who never want to
look behind the curtain all the way down to total dorks who must see
into the machine.  And distributions like ubuntu are beginning to allow
that full spectrum to use gnu/linux, as well.

Going back up to the topic of the internet (not the web), the
loosy-goosy user-controllable collection of resources, seems like a
natural fit for use-cases calling for dynamism and, especially,
resilience and graceful failure.  But with the ubiquity of high
bandwidth pipes and the Windows monolithic/obfuscating/delegating
attitude, we have a bit of a conflict between the users' expectations
(e.g. "the internet is just another desktop application") and the
reality (e.g. "the internet is a loose and incommensurate collection of
programs listening to various ports).  Unfortunately, www users (subset
of internet users) don't want to see behind the curtain at all.  They're
just _begging_ obfuscators like microsoft to do all that computery stuff
for them.

The perennial question is: do the morlocks try to force the eloi to look
at and understand the machines or do they allow them to live out their
lives in blissful ignorance (until we get hungry)?

I believe I have seen this suggested on this list before because of
it's Linux support and I've read reviews that the Linux support is
excellent.

Some people had problems getting it to tune correctly but I think that
is just a setup problem.

Subject: [PLUG] Tools for Book Length Works
Message-ID: <b773d6d6b0ea9296daf24f3ce0a33f19.squirrel@mail.web-ster.com>

Well, the voices in my head have been getting steadily louder for months
now, and I'm finally making out distinct statements from all the mumbling:
"time to write another book".  I know from experience that they'll settle
down without chemical help if I actually get the book written, so I guess
I'm committed (or perhaps I will be).

Anyone who's written a long work in OpenOffice and Word know that they
both suck.  Neither of them scale well, and both of them go _really
slowly_ when you want to see the whole document.  The OpenOffice version I
used to do this had an edge over Word because it, at least, didn't inspire
any power cycles -- but that writing experience came was years after the
Microsoft writing experience.

Probably the smoothest experience I had with this was writing my Master's
thesis, which I did in LaTeX.  But that was in 1990, and I don't see as
many technical books coming out these days with the note "this book
written and typeset in LaTeX" any more.

The book is intended as a self-study guide and lab manual for learning
automatic control theory.  As such it'll have at least 27 8x10 color
glossy photographs, with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of
each one, that will be included in the book to illustrate what is being
done.  Lots of graphs, and the occasional flowchart and/or class diagram
will also make its way into the book.

I may self-publish the book for a while, but I also intend to sell parts
of it to Circuit Cellar magazine when I'm done, and when I think it's all
good I'll be hawking it to Elsevier as a companion volume to my control
theory book.

And that's the first wrench in the works -- when I started that book I
raised the possibility of doing it in LaTeX, and my editor crossed her
fingers at me and started reciting biblical passages.  She was cool with
me using OpenOffice, though (perhaps knowing the alternative), but the
production house that they chose to do the work had some difficulty with
the job, to the extent that there are a number of drawings that lack their
lowermost horizontal lines, and a number of '1's where there should be
'-1's.

So I'm a bit torn.  I think I'll have an easier time of self-publishing if
I use LaTeX (and LaTeX is distinctly better than OOo at typesetting
equations), but I know I'll have more acceptance from Elsevier -- and
probably from Circuit Cellar -- if I give them .doc files.  I think the
only really decisive "no" that I can come up to for LaTeX is if I can't
find a decent way to get drawings and graphs into the document.

So does anyone on the list write long works?  What tools do you use?  How
do you like them?  Is there anyone here with experience getting a LaTeX
manuscript published?  Is it still an accepted thing, or has it become Old
News for technical work?

TIA

As far as I can tell, I think that there are few, if any, tuners that 
will work in Linux that don't work in Windows.

It is the reverse that is often true because PC hardware manufacturers 
would be crazy to produce a product that didn't work in Windows, unless 
they were targeting a very specific niche as their customer base. This 
means the trick is to find a card that is known to work in Linux...

I don't think you will find any instance where leaving a USB/PCI tuner 
card plugged in that will cause Windows to misbehave, as long as you 
take the time to install the Windows drivers properly (even if you don't 
use the device in Windows).


I see 3 options for you, all of which should be viable:


Option 1: Stick with Windows.

If you want to build a Windows TV/PVR system, GVPVR is a pretty good 
alternative to Windows Media Center. I used GBPVR for a while before 
switching to Linux, and was pretty happy with it.

http://www.gbpvr.com/

The only thing I didn't like about this was codec support in the media 
player. (I think it may have been related to a lack of knowledge on my 
part at the time.  I ended up purchasing, and installing, Intervideo's 
mpeg2 codec to get decent playback for my system. I probably didn't need 
to, but I had a hard time separating the wheat from the chaff when 
searching for free mpeg2 codecs.)


Option 2: Convert to Linux

If you want a Linux solution, you can use MythTv, or a host of other 
alternatives that you may encounter while researching Linux TV/PVR 
applications.

If you want to run MythTv in Linux, have a look at the MythTv website, 
and you can see all kinds of information that will help you decide:

http://www.mythtv.org

There are many Linux distributions that are geared towards a Linux 
TV/PVR system. Personally, I use Mythbuntu as it is very easy to set up:

http://www.mythbuntu.org/

And, here is the page that describes the capture cards that MythTv can 
use, and their caveats. (Some cards require some extra attention to get 
working, but once the issues are worked through, it generally works great.):

http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Category:Video_capture_cards

You would probably want to base your tuner purchasing decision on the 
information you can gather from there.

If you convert fully to Linux, you can still use VirtualBox, or VMWare, 
to run a Virtual Windows computer inside of Linux, where you can install 
all of the applications that don't work in Linux.

The caveat is that since it would be a virtual machine, it won't be able 
to utilize your hardware fully, and will likely run slower (depending on 
the amount of RAM, etc. you can devote to the virtual machine), and you 
probably won't have access to any specialized hardware that may be 
installed in your system, because of the virtualization.


Option 3: Dual Boot

This will give you the opportunity to do whatever you like, but in 
addition to having to repartition your disks, you would have to 
completely quit one to switch to the other. Which would be inconvenient 
if you were trying to record a show in Linux, but needed to switch to 
Windows to run your Windows applications.


I hope that is helpful to you, and if there is a better solution than 
any of those three, I can't think of it.

Tim,

   That's because the publishers remove that line. Write in LaTeX, but take a
look at the LyX GUI front end <http://www.lyx.org/>. I wrote my book with it
(Springer-Verlag took it camera-ready), and use it for all my writing.
Unless I have to share writing with colleagues or agency staff.

   Yup. LaTeX/LyX is what you need.

   Elsevier has document classes for LyX/LaTeX that a number of folks use so
it may be that the company has come into the 20th century by now.

   Feh! Of course you can; .jpg, .png, .eps, .pdf. I like to use PSTricks for
my vector-graphics and there's never a problem with LyX/LaTeX.

   See above. Check out my book on amazon.com: "Quantifying Environmental
Impact Assessments Using Fuzzy Logic."

Thank you Rich.  Not only did you give me the detail I needed to make my
decision, but you told me what I wanted to hear!

Do you know to whom I should apply for the Elsevier document classes, and
whether I want to start using them from day 1 or if I can start my writing
independently then use their stuff later?

And one last question: what's the right forum, USENET group or email list
to look to for help getting spun back up on LaTeX after a 20 year hiatus?

Thanks.

   They come with most LaTeX distributions. Or, they're available via the LyX
web site or mail list.

   Whether to use them from the start is up to you. However, if ultimately
that's the format you want then start with it. The changes from one style to
another are pretty subtle. I used the svmono book style because that's what
Springer-Verlag provides for its monograph books. I use the same style for
other long projects for which the book class is more appropriate (compared
with the report or article classes).

   Rarely do I write LaTeX in emacs because I've found LyX to be so much more
productive. Take the 20-minute tutorial and you'll be well on your way. Just
use any document style to get going. When you want to use the Elsevier
style, it's a simple menu change: Document -> Settings -> Class.

   The lyx mail list is very active and exceptionally helpful. The developers
all participate howto advice comes quickly. I used to follow the USENET
group, comp.text.tex, but found more help with the lyx group.

   I wrote a draft white paper yesterday with LyX and originally used the
KOMA-script article class (all the KOMA script classes are highly
customizable). When I decided to tweak the apparance of the final version
today I changed to the ams-book class (that's the Amerian Mathematical
Society) even though I have no equations in it, reset the page size to US
letter, the margins to 1" top and bottom, 1.25" inside, and 1" outside and
the changes took place immediately cut it down from 11 pages to 8 pages.

I recently completed a book with a fairly complex layout. Here is a
link to some screenshots:

http://wiki.scribus.net/index.php/Success_stories#Book_on_Linguistics.2C_200_pages

I started it with OOo. Although it ended up being 152 pages I never
experienced speed issues. However, OOo drove me nuts with bugs when
creating formulas (typeset formulas, not table formulas to calculate
something). OOo is also a poor tool with graphics because they tend to
jump all over the place, almost as bad as Word. There were a number of
other annoyances as well.

I had the book essentially finished in OOo, but the bugs were making it
difficult to get correct output. So I started looking around for
alternatives. Rich (whose comment I expected) turned me on to Lyx and I
spent a week trying to get my head around it. Eventually I gave up. It
just didn't click for me. Having said that, if you are experienced at
LaTeX you will probably love it.

I am very visual and love a program that is rigorously WYSIWYG. In the
past I have used QuarkXPress, PageMaker and InDesign. While I love
InDesign the most, I wanted FOSS. I had used Scribus on occasion in the
past for small projects - fliers and the like. So I installed the
latest development version (1.3.5.1) and set to work. It is not nearly
as fully featured yet as InDesign, but I was able to complete the book
with it. The results are excellent, and the current development version
is very stable. 

The development version has a new feature called a Render Frame. You
can use it to write anything with LaTeX, LilyPond, or any of several
other tools. I have not actually used it, but I did play around with it
a bit. I can see where it could be very useful for someone familiar
with LaTeX but who also likes the WYSIWYG capabilities of Scribus.

Having said all of that, Scribus is frustratingly slow with long
documents. There would also be a learning curve for you that would be
avoided if you stick to LaTeX or Lyx. But if you like being able to see
on screen exactly what is going to come out in your PDF or print
output, it is worth taking for a spin.

When I write for publishers, it's historically been a struggle to even
make them accept OpenOffice.org documents. Since OOo 2.x, .doc files
written from OOo Writer have been (almost) seamless with most publisher
templates. 

But there have been a few hiccups with some specialty styles required by
some publishers. 

With the advent of OOo 3.x, previous visual issues with embedded notes
have been solved. Haven't tried it yet, but I'm hopeful ODF will work
with publisher templates written in Word. 

I've never written for SV, so O'Reilly is the only publisher I know of
who accepts LaTeX. I'd guess O'Reilly allied publishers (e.g. No Starch)
may also accept LaTeX.

Thanks,
Mike

Michael,

I see in the other message thread, I see that you are looking at this 
device:

http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16815327005

It should work nicely (with some caveats)

If by option 4, you mean to use the (usually feature-limited) playback 
applications that come bundled with the device you purchase (whether it 
is this, or some other device), then that can work, but usually they are 
lacking a lot of functionality, and I was thinking that you might like a 
more full-featured solution, thus the TV/PVR suggestions I mentioned.

If you don't want a full-featured TV/PVR solution, there's nothing wrong 
with that, so forget I mentioned them.


Regardless of what device you end up purchasing, and what application 
you use to view the recorded shows, there are some considerations in the 
channel tuning arena that would be good to bring to your attention, if 
they haven't been discussed already.

Do you plan to tune in free, over the air, channels using an antenna?

Or, do you plan to plug the device into the cable outlet?

Or, do you plan to connect the device directly to the cable box?


Antenna:
If you are going the antenna route, then you should not have any 
difficulties receiving, and watching HDTV on whatever platform you 
choose, other than missing channels that your antenna can't pull in for 
you (due to location/obstructions/weak signal/etc.).


Cable Outlet:
If you are plugging the device into the cable wall outlet, Comcast (if 
that is your provider) uses Virtual Channel Tables to remap channels to 
different frequencies, which adds some complexity to getting the channel 
setup right, and can be quite a pain, but there are software tools that 
make it easier for certain applications. Specifically a program called 
scte65scan (which is what I use to get the channels setup in MythTV).

In addition, you will only have access to the channels which come in 
unencrypted - which for me is thirteen channels that are not public 
access, or shopping channels (i.e. I currently get the standard local 
channels, and WGN, USS, DISC(pacific feed), and KOPB (which is different 
from the local HD broadcast version for non-prime time programming), 
which are pretty much subject to Comcast's whim of whether they send the 
signal encrypted, or not).

If you want to receive all of the channels that you pay for, you need a 
cablecard built into the tuner(which really increases the complexity, 
and, as far as I can tell, availability is limited, to non-existent, 
depending on whom you ask, and how you plan to use it).


Cable Box:
If you are plugging the device into the cable box to receive all the 
channels available to you by subscription, then the device will need to 
read analog data, which I don't think the HDHomeRun can do, then you 
would need one cable box per tuner, and you will need to manually change 
the channels on the cable boxes as needed. An alternative would be to 
setup an IR Blaster, or similar solution, to change the channels on the 
cable boxes at the right time automatically.


Anyhow, I hope this information is useful to you, and if not, maybe it 
is useful to someone else on the mailing list.

- Jim

I wonder if I can hook up a satellite feed, but in all honesty I'm
after over the air via a rabbit ears antenna.  The encryption 
problem with cable is an interesting one, I suppose it limits 
what people who are on cable can do.  As far as my play station 
II, I might use an old analog television that's available.

Satellite television has been something in the far off future for
a long time.  It is hard to justify the expense, on the other hand,
there are some channels that aren't available over the air.

The play station runs at standard definition so there should be a cheap
device that doesn't act as a PVR but that does allow for a computer
running Linux or Windows 98SE for that matter to put the images on
the screen.  I really don't want to put XP on an old PIII 450.  I
especially don't want to considering that this is a games machine
where some of the games on it require Windows 98SE.  There was a
project to port Red Alert I Command and Conquer to Linux, but it
appears that the project disintegrated.

The morlocks tell the eloi, "look at this cute widdle penguin, don't you

Then the morlocks get to spend less time delousing their loved ones' PCs

Doesn't do analog, not a problem for broadcast-only use but Comcast
basic cable is mostly analog (for now, will go away Some Day).

Doesn't support CableCard, so no chance of premium channels. For 2x
the price you can future-proof your investment:

If this is all you want, then I think you are probably best off getting 
a cheap ATSC card for receiving HD content over the air, and running it 
in Windows, or Linux, (whatever you prefer) on your P4 computer.
(But, once you get bitten by the HTPC bug, you start to feel really 
limited after a while, and would want to upgrade to something better 
that does more tricks.)

Yes, to the consternation of many! It is a heated discussion topic on 
lots of message boards.

Satellite provides roughly the same limitations relevant to this topic 
as cable television does, since you would need DISH, DirectTV, or 
whomever's receivers, to decode the satellite signal.

I'm not very familiar with the satellite receivers, but I think you 
would likely need multiple satellite receiver boxes for tuning more than 
one channel at a time, just like cable.

If you were to 'roll your own' free satellite solution, you would need 
to consider that you might need to reposition the dish to pull in 
different channels, since different satellites carry different content. 
To top it off, the satellite feeds that you can tune in are going to be 
mostly encrypted for anything good, so you are still back to the same 
dilemma as cable.

I saw lots of old NTSC analog cards at FreeGeek's thrift store downtown 
that you could purchase very cheaply, but I doubt this system would have 
the horsepower to run any of them well (regardless of operating system):

If it were me, I would leave this box as-is, and continue to look at 
adding to your P4 system.

Either that, or look at getting another computer that is roughly the 
same caliber to use for this purpose.

You might be able to get a relatively powerful system down at FreeGeek 
for between $50-100, depending on what they have available at the time.

Stupid question, why do you need a gigahertz or better computer
to run a tuner card that simply allows you to display the play
station II's analog low definition output on your screen?  The
play station II, if I'm not mistaken, is only a 300 mhz computer.
I can possibly upgrade my 450 mhz PIII to 750 mhz, but that's
the cheapest thing I can do.

Maybe I'm going about this all wrong, maybe there is a Play Station
II emulator I can use.

It isn't the playback that consumes the CPU it is recording analog to disk.
It has to encode it to MPEG2 before it sticks it on the disk.  It
takes at about a 1GHZ
machine to encode a single TV stream to MPEG in real-time.  To do more than one
turner, more GHZ .

That is why a premium is paid for cards that have hardware encoders on them.

Digital TV is a different story.  It is broadcast in a MPEG2 transport
stream that
can be saved directly to disk.  No encoding to worry about.

To expand on Larry's explanation, your PC has to convert the incoming 
analog signal from your Playstation to a compatible digital signal the 
PC understands, and then pipe it through your video card, before it can 
be displayed on your monitor. This is expensive processor-wise if an 
encoder is not built onto the capture card. And, if the card has an 
encoder to lighten the load on your processor, then you suffer the delay 
while it is written to disk. This would likely make your Playstation 
games unplayable.

I forgot all about FreeGeek's volunteer program. Thanks for bringing it 
up, Larry.

As cash to spend is an issue, you can indeed volunteer to build PC's for 
FreeGeek. After you have built a certain number of PC's using recycled 
parts (5-6 IIRC), you get to build one for yourself (and, within reason, 
I think that they allow you your pick of the available hardware). Who 
knows, you might even score a video capture card as part of the deal, too!

If I remember the stats on what they classify as recyclable hardware 
correctly, one of these systems is almost guaranteed to be capable of 
handling your wants, and needs.

Speaking specifically to the Playstation / PC processor differences:

There are chips in the playstation that are designed to do specific 
tasks that are unique to the Playstation's function. These tasks bypass 
the Playstation processor altogether, so it does not need its CPU to do 
any work for the tasks the chips perform.

A PC is not going to have these special chips in it, due to the generic 
nature of the design, so it has to emulate those tasks in software, 
which takes a lot more CPU horsepower.

This is simply wrong. There is no requirement to compress the video to
MPEG of any variety before recording to disk. Both of my old analog
cards would just dump the whole stream to the disk quite happily. It
took a huge amount of space(30-100GB), but that wasn't a problem, as
my intention with the card was live TV and converting VHS tapes to
DVD, so I only needed to have one or two things stored on the disk at
a time. I would then compress the video as a second step as well as
run it through filters to clean it up and deinterlace, etc. I used a
300MHz pentium 2 or 3 to do this.

Although according to this page, a 450MHz should be able to handle
compressing analog into MPEG2 live.
http://ati.amd.com/products/faqs/allinwonderfaq.html
(See answer to question #5)

I was very happy with my ATI card, and also with my old Hauppauge.
Both of those could be had for cheap these days. They wouldn't handle
digital TV at all, but could do the input from your playstation
without breaking a sweat. In fact if you're not saving the video but
just viewing it my experience is that it doesn't take much CPU power
at all. The ATI, since it's also the system's video card, didn't
hardly touch the rest of the system if you were just watching video
full screen. The Hauppauge WinTV-Go that I had also had needed
extremely low system resources. (well, I still have it, just not in my
computer hooked to the cable, and I'm still happy with it.) I think it
used DMA or something like that to dump the stream directly to the
video card. In fact looking at the specs, they recommend a 90MHz
minimum. That's ridiculously low power compared to anything remotely
modern.

http://registration.hauppauge.com/webstore/specialofferforintelintegrators.asp

So there are options. Again, Hauppauge is very well known for having
at least some of their cards being wonderful under Linux. I don't know
if that holds for their whole line or not.

If you mainly want to just play your playstation through the computer
screen you can get one of these off Ebay for $15 shipped to your door.

That is one thing that surprised me about my newer capture card. The
software that comes with it has no option to turn off the buffer so it
makes the games unplayable. But using alternative software bypasses
that and makes it perfect again.

But both of the old analog ones I had took care of turning the analog
signal into a digital stream. No compression, but that also means
nothing needs to be decoded. In fact, I think any capture card by
definition has to turn the analog into digital. It's the compression
that takes the extra power. If the capture card can directly hand off
the frames to the video output card then it doesn't take much CPU
power at all. The heavy lifting for simple live viewing is already
done by the capture card. If you want to do PVR stuff is the only
place you need more power. But neither one of them had any noticeable
delay. They worked wonderfully for any game playing.

And both of the analog cards I got were fairly old tech when I got
them years ago. They weren't all that much money even then.

I got my MK700 Logitech wireless keyboard working with LTSP, but I can't
get the mouse to work.  Normally the mouse works in Linux, so I'm wondering
what it is that I'm missing.  I posted to the Ltsp-discuss list, but  
it appears
to be a very low traffic list where I may be the only one on it.

As far as LTSP 5, that doesn't seem to be available for CentOS.

Good catch Erik,

I didn't realize that these cards had that low of system requirements 
for passing the stream to the video card. It looks like there are a few 
solutions for Michael's P3, after all!

I vaguely remember looking at them when I put together my first PVR, and 
decided to go with the Hauppauge PVR150's, since they had the mpeg 
encoders on the card, which is what I wanted.

I was at the freegeek thriftstore a couple of weeks ago, and they had a 
few of these in the bins.

So, one could probably pick one up there for cheap, and not have to wait 
for shipping.

Getting some error messages and wondering if there's an easy fix.

Dual booting with Windows XP, running the latest Linux Mint on an HP,  
1gb/250gb hd. Nowhere close to using up the hard drive.

After reading some earlier posts here about LyX I decided to give it  
a try, and tried installing the package. Near the end of the process  
(45 minutes or so, with LaTex and a bunch of other downloads) I got  
an error message and it seemed to abort . . . more or less. LyX is  
listed among the office software packages, but nothing happens when I  
tried to run it. Since the install seemed incomplete, that's no big  
issue.

The more significant issue came up when I then tried running OO  
Writer, and tried saving a short text document. Got the message:  
"OpenOffice.org could not save important internal formation due to  
insufficient free disk space at the following location: /home/[my  
home directory]/.openoffice.org/3/user/backup
"You will not be able to continue working with OpenOffice.org without  
allocating more free disk space at that location. Press the 'retry'  
button after you have allocated more free disk space to retry saving  
the data."

Also a few other curiosities, such as reluctance to read or copy  
documents from the Windows side that it had previously been working  
with just fine. (And an odd disappearance on Firefox of back-button  
functionality, though the browser otherwise works okay.)

Tried reboot, couple of times, but no change.

I guess I'm wondering first of all if there's some sort of system  
restore that takes me back to the pre-LyX install period? (The system  
had been working fine up until then.) Or what the next best, probably  
meaning simplest, option might be?

And let me know if there's more info I could provide that would help.

There are very few applications that will work if you're out of disk
space, which is what that message is indicating.

I don't know how Mint works -- if it is debian-based, then you can try
running 'apt-get clean' as root (without the quotes).  That will
delete the downloaded packages that have been used to install things.
This will clear up some space, but it's not likely to be a long-term
solution.

Do you have anything that you can backup and delete?

You can check the amount of free/used disk space by running 'df -h' at
a terminal.  You should see something similar to this:

$  df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda5              85G   57G   24G  71% /
tmpfs                 1.5G     0  1.5G   0% /lib/init/rw
udev                   10M  276K  9.8M   3% /dev
tmpfs                 1.5G  404K  1.5G   1% /dev/shm

you're only concerned with the lines that start with /dev/.... (the
specific device(s) will probably be different for you.  In my case, my
drive is in one partition at /dev/sda5, but yours might be at
/dev/hda3, for example.)

It sounds as though something filled up your hard disk. The first thing
to check is whether that is true or not. If true you'll probably find
some bogus folder with a gazillion copies of something. The contents
will give a good clue as to what process caused the problem.

I had a similar thing happen to me a couple years ago with Ubuntu. I
can't remember what caused it, but I do remember that I only discovered
it when I got to PSU and I couldn't log in to my laptop. And I didn't
have a rescue CD with me. I had to go over to the Linux help desk and
borrow a Knoppix so I could figure out what happened. I now keep a live
CD in my backpack.

Once you know that you have decent space on the disk, try launching and
running Lyx and OOo again. If Lyx still won't launch, try launching it
from the command line. Launching things from the command line is a good
way to get error messages that are hidden when you run from the panel
launch menu. I think the command is just "lyx," but if I'm wrong you
can get the command by looking at the properties for the launch menu
item.

If the installation of Lyx left you with a botched install you can
reinstall with Synaptic Package Manager, or from the command line with
apt-get or aptitude. Lyx requires a lot of other packages to be
installed. As you noted it requires LaTeX, and a lot of fonts as well
as dependencies and stuff.

"apt-get clean" will only clean downloaded pkgs from apt pkg cache. 

Whenever something like this happens to me I run "apt-get purge <pkg name>"
this will uninstall the pkg(s) and all it's config files.

Subject: [PLUG] insufficient disk space error
Message-ID: <5858C415-9831-41EA-8DC6-719654923F62@ridenbaugh.com>

Getting some error messages and wondering if there's an easy fix.

Dual booting with Windows XP, running the latest Linux Mint on an HP,  
1gb/250gb hd. Nowhere close to using up the hard drive.

After reading some earlier posts here about LyX I decided to give it  
a try, and tried installing the package. Near the end of the process  
(45 inutes or so) I got an error message and it seemed to abort . . .  
more or less. LyX is listed among the office software packages, but  
nothing happened when I tried to run it.

The more significant issue came up when I then tried running OO  
Writer, and tried saving a short text document. Got the message:  
"OpenOffice.org could not save important internal formation due to  
insufficient free disk space at the following location: /home/[my  
home directory]/.openoffice.org/3/user/backup
"You will not be able to continue working with OpenOffice.org without  
allocating more free disk space at that location. Press the 'retry'  
button after you have allocated more free disk space to retry saving  
the data."

Also a few other curiosities, such as reluctance to read or copy  
documents from the Windows side that it had previously been working  
with just fine.

I guess I'm wondering first of all if there's some sort of system  
restore that takes me back to the pre-LyX install period? (The system  
had been working fine up until then.) Or what the next best, probably  
meaning simplest, option might be?

Also, 'apt-get autoremove' will delete packages that aren't needed anymore
(ew, leftover extra pakages installed as requirements for a specific package
that was installed tnen removed later).

Thanks much for the help. Problem's resolved.

I used apt-get purge to get rid of the Lyx install, and that worked  
fine.
Didn't resolve entirely my other problem, which turned out to be a  
matter of my own stupidity: On my dual boot, I had a limited amount  
of space allocated for the Linux partition, had loaded a bunch of  
music into it, and when the lyx install came in, that pushed it to  
the limit. Killed out the music (which was duplicate from elsewhere,  
so no loss) and it works fine again. My lesson out of this was, One  
aspect of doing a dual boot: Pay attention to where your files are.

I can think of 2 things that might be wrong:

1) no gcc; check by typing gcc in a command line
2) permissions on install directory are incorrect check by 'cd'ing to your
install directory, and typing "touch x" .  You should get no errors.

Let us know the results.

Are you sure you didn't fill your hard drive or one of the partitions during
the LyX install? How did you verify this?

It turns out that was what I did. Without realizing it, I had filled  
the Linux partition nearly to the top with music files, and then when  
I did the LyX install, it filled totally. I got rid of the music  
files, and things seem to operating ok now.

You could try the LFS support list (lfs-support at linuxfromscratch.org, I 
believe). That having been said, your problem is that your temporary C 
compiler expects to find its libraries in /usr/lib - something broke 
along they way, before you made it to 5.8. Your best bet is to backtrack 
and find out where things went awry.

Usually when an installer throws an error that it can't find files and those files
do in fact exist on your system it's a matter of the those files not being in the place
that the installer is looking for them in.

In a previous post you had set the library path, "
LIBRARY_PATH=/tools/lib" however in this thread,
http://old.nabble.com/gcc-4.3.2:-statically-link-mpfr--td19576453.html,
the refer to the "LD_LIBRARY_PATH". Not sure if that makes a difference or not...?

Subject: [PLUG] Foomatic, HP2600n, foo2hp driver
Message-ID: <20100208043427.GA4289@gate.kl-ic.com>

I asked a few days ago about ethernet-to-USB print servers - thanks
to Aaron for pointing out the one at Free Geek.  It turns out my
question was unnecessary, because the laser printer in the storage
locker turned out to be an HP2600n, with an ethernet port, not the
HP1600 I thought I had bought as a cheaper source of toner cartridges.

That said, unlike my HP2605dn, the HP2600n does not offer Postscript,
but is a glorified winprinter using the Zenographics ZjStream protocol.
The best driver is the foo2hp at http://foo2hp.rkkda.com/ .  I compiled
and ran it on one of my RHEL5-clone systems.  I also upgraded
ghostscript to version 8.70 (in /usr/local/bin ) for the best rendering.

There was a problem - the PPD file has options for vertically 
offsetting the CMY colors relative to black, between plus or minus
100 lines, 1/6 of an inch.  With my version of foomatic, that works
for all nonzero offsets, but it turns an offset of zero into an
offset of -100 lines.  

Replacing something like foomatic in a distro is problematic - if
it gets an automatic update, I lose the fix.

The easiest thing to do was to hack a new and simplified version of
the PPD file.  I took out the entire Group describing them, then
reconfigured the printer.  No offsets - if I need them for some
bizarre reason, I can still use the original driver.

For more information, see my wiki:
  http://wiki.keithl.com/index.cgi?foo2hp
and the foo2hp forum:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH is for finding shared libraries at runtime:
http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html
the use of LD_LIBRARY_PATH is considered poor form in some circles:
http://xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/_/ldpath.html

If you insist, ldconfig is used with LD_LIBRARY_PATH to set up file links
and library cache.

http://linux.die.net/man/8/ldconfig

LIBRARY_PATH is for finding "special linker files" and libraries at compile
time:
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.2/gcc/Environment-Variables.html

"The value of LIBRARY_PATH is a colon-separated list of directories, much
like PATH. When configured as a native compiler, GCC tries the directories
thus specified when searching for special linker files, if it can't find
them using GCC_EXEC_PREFIX. Linking using GCC also uses these directories
when searching for ordinary libraries for the -l option (but directories
specified with -L come first)."

   My reading of the gawk man page and my Google searches haven't shown me
how to have awk ignore the '@' symbol in an e-mail address.

   I have a file where each record looks like this:

   First Second e-mail at address

   What I want is the file to look like this:

Second [tab]Second[comma space] First[tab]e-mail at address[tab]string

I tried a quickie one-liner from the command line:

awk -f .co-commissioners.addresses '$2 "\t" $2 ", " $1 "\t" $3 "marketing"' > temp.tmp

and get this error:

awk: .co-commissioners.addresses:1:    ^ invalid char '@' in expression

   How do I specify to awk that the '@' is part of a field?

Why the -f?

This works for me:

$ echo "First Second e-mail at address" |
awk '{print $2 "\t" $2 ", " $1 "\t" $3 "\tmarketing"}' |
cat -A
Second^ISecond, First^Ie-mail at address^Imarketing$

Subject: [PLUG] Sun VirtualBolluxed
Message-ID: <4B704F23.3020701@wescottdesign.com>

For the very first time I tried the "save machine state" in Sun 
VirtualBox last week.  This morning I confidently went to open my 
Windows virtual machine to peek at some past invoices.  I got a little 
dialog that reported that VirtualBox was "restoring machine state".  It 
duly got to 99% -- then my machine reset, suddenly and without giving 
Linux a chance to do anything at all.  Fortunately I didn't have 
anything else running, at least in user space, in either the Windows 
virtual machine or on my Linux box.

Being stubborn, I tried it again.  Same deal.

Fortunately again, Sun gives you a way to discard the state of the 
virtual machine ("warning this is just like giving the virtual machine a 
hard reset" says Sun -- "well good!", thinks I), and doing so retrieved 
things to the point where I can get my accounting done.

Is this a known problem?  The obvious work-around is "don't do that", 
but I'm wondering if there's anything I could do differently to make it 
all better.

The only thing I can think of that may be unusual is that the virtual 
machine was created under the GPL version, but I'm now running Sun's 
free binary so I can get access to the USB ports.

TIA

You were probably comparing apples and oranges though.

The Perl statement "$x = $y * $z" does a *lot* more work than the C statement
"x = y * z", because a Perl scalar is a lot fancier than a C variable.

If you had compared Perl's PDL libs against your C program (where you can
actually use native data types instead of Perl's fancy data types), I think
you'd find it to be far closer, perhaps within a factor of two again.

But I'm tired of trying to fight the ignorance around this.  It's about
how much your language is doing for you, not whether it's "interpreted"
or "compiled".

not to mention that if you follows this line of logic the
highest level language that one should use would be Assembly/Assembler.

Cool.  Where can I get a Perl interpreter that'll work on an 8-bit 
processor with 128 bytes of RAM?

Cool.  Where can I get a Perl interpreter that'll work on an 8-bit 
processor with 128 bytes of RAM?

(Sorry -- I just had to stir the pot).

I am using the OSE version on Fedora 11 x86_64. (You didn't say which
distro you have.)

It is working fine here, but I note that the Software Update GUI has
announced a number of updates for the kernel, for virtualbox, and for
the tools that virtualbox uses to update itself for kernel updates. All
these updates have been in the past week.

I can't offer other suggestions, but since there have been some recent
changes, perhaps they are responsible for your current issues.

Ubuntu (I always forget at least one important detail the first time 
around -- that's how you know I've not been replaced by an AI trying to 
pass a Turing test).

It may have been there from day 1 -- this is the first, and probably 
last for a long while, time that I tried saving the machine state.

I don't even know what "saving the machine state" means. When I make a
backup it includes ~/.virtualbox. That folder contains all my installed
machines. 

In my recent peregrination through various distros I discovered that
with a new, fresh install of a distro all I had to do was install
virtualbox, then copy my ~/.virtualbox folder from the previous distro.
All my machines and configurations were instantly available, the same
as before.

So if it is a backup you want, all you have to do is make a copy of
~/.virtualbox.

"Saving machine state" means saving all the currently running programs, open
windows, etc. to disk, allowing you to quickly resume the machine and get
back to what you were doing later.  This is the same concept as
suspend-to-disk on a regular (non-virtual) computer, where it saves the
current "state" i.e. open programs to disk, then powers down.  VirtualBox
keeps the saved state in another file separate from the virtual disk and
virtual machine config files.

Subject: [PLUG] network "make install" ?
Message-ID: <20100210001320.GA11873@gate.kl-ic.com>

In an environment of five or six homogenous machines, repeated
"download, unpack, make, make install" process is time consuming.
I suppose I should learn to build packages, and it would be a
little easier.  

With just a few machines, though, it would be even easier if
I could do a "make install" to remote machines, perhaps 
giving this hypothetical tool a list of all the machines I 
want to do the same installation on.

Since I am not as clever as a skilled programmer, I assume this
desire has already been addressed, and there is an existing
tool that would be good for this.  Suggestions?

If your machines are well-synchronized in terms of what is installed
upon them, NFS is the tool I've used in the past--you can use it one
of two ways:

1 [preferred in my opinion]) - install everything to /usr/local, and
NFS export /usr/local to all client machines, and you're done.  you'll
have to diddle the makefile paths (hopefully stuff uses configure so
you can just ./configure --prefix=/usr/local instead of editing
stuff...)

2) make your build directory available on nfs at the same path.  build
on one machine, then ssh around and cd /nfshomedir ; make install on
various machines.

Half the machines are laptops - they are often untethered from
the internal environment.  If there is some accepted way to divide
/usr/local into fixed and portable and  subsets, then I could use
NFS for print drivers and the like, perhaps.

You might consider stow or checkinstall.  The latter will generate a
package that duplicates what a "make install" does.  That way you can
install, remove and version-track your nifty thingies.

This assumes the machines are binary-compatible, mind.

checkinstall doesn't work for 64 bit machines (at least the last time
I tried it).

I have used checkinstall on several occasions without issue on 64 bit
Kubuntu 9.10.  It also worked on 9.04 & 8.10, not sure before that..

If the machines are running the same distro/gcc/kernel or whatever is
required by the package that's being built it should be pretty simple
to dist it out once you've built it once, re-package in whatever
format you want, scp to to other machine untar/zip the file and run
make install again.

Oh- and if the machines are *not* binary-compatible (e.g. different
distros/versions/archs) but similar enough that the same configure/make
options work, ClusterSSH (cssh) might be your friend here.

I sure do miss the days of running ClusterSSH on 200 machines at the same
time...

You might bite the bullet and look at something like cfengine
or puppet.  Either of them will help you centralize your administration,
allowing you to specify once everything that is common (including
fetching those files from a central location), and specify the unique
parts of each setup.

On the form linked in the fine article, one can both nominate and 
comment, as an individual or on behalf of an organization. i made a plug 
(no pun intended) for Portland metro area east of the Wilamette.

This is something that Personal Telco has been working on/advocating
for a while.  I put in a nomination and pointed them at the City
people who would be responsible.  And frankly, even without a magical
benefactor like Google, this is something that the citizens of
Portland *could* do on their own.  It just takes some thought, some
demonstration projects, and some investment.

Google's goals are find for now. How much will the fiber be worth when
everyone needs a yottabyte/sec?

Suppose I spend $5,000 to get fiber installed to my house, either
through taxes or a utility charge. But the fiber must be replaced by
some new technology that we haven't thought of yet in 20 years.
That means the installation cost me $250 a year. 

I love Google, but they ain't no such a thing as a free lunch.

A) it doesn't cost $5k to install.  B) you are paying $1k a year to
Comcast as it is and will until you die.  Consider the net present
value of that stream! and C) fiber doesn't really go obsolete.  You
can replace the equipment at the ends pretty easily and *bang* it
suddenly goes faster.  NTT in Japan has pushed 14 Terabits per second
over 160 kilometers of fiber.  Bell labs apparently has the record of
155 channels of 100Gbps (15.5 terabits) over a single strand 7000 km
fiber.

John> I love Google, but they ain't no such a thing as a free lunch.

But there is such a thing as egregious waste and gouging, and that's
what you are getting today with Comcast and the other incumbents.  You
can argue that they are the best *current* option, and you might be
right (if you leave aside "freedom").

Google is trying to bust up a logjam of inaction.  They aren't
planning to do this everywhere.  They want to demonstrate what is
actually known, that this is entirely do-able, to show what asshats
the incumbents are for dragging their feet so badly.  The natural
hunger and envy of broadband users will (I think and, apparently, they
think) bust through the logjam and actually get this deployed in
the US instead of just overseas where Americans can't see it or even
conceive that it exists.

B) While it is someone silly to assume that Comcast won't raise their 
rates considering their history the NPV for 20 years of 1K/yr payments
assuming 5% (historical avg) rate is $12,462.  Assuming that Comcast
raises rates at 3% average / year the NPV is $15,965.  

Adjust years, inflation and rate as needed.

C) Russell's point is worth paying attention to.  Fiber media has remained 
much more stable than even copper wire.

There are several PLUGs. I recently had a response to a question on a
Debian user list from an individual whose signature line indicated he
was a member of the Phoenix Linux User Group. There may be a dozen or
more in all.

And so is System Monitor.

Something is eating 100% of one of my CPUs on my Fedora 11 x86_64
Thinkpad. Occasionally it drops down, at which point the other CPU
surges to 100%. (I think they switch back and forth, probably so one of
them doesn't get too tired and go on strike.)

System Monitor shows nothing taking more than a couple percent of
either CPU. From the command line top also shows nothing.

Are there other tools to sleuth this down? Commands I could use?

Slow down.
Where are you getting that 100% CPU number from??
If that were true, you probably could not run top.

Maybe something like this?

ps -eo pcpu,pid,user,args | sort -k 1 -r | head -10

That'll show you the top 10 processes and who owns them.

I just found out just now based on this query to the list about
something called mpstat which will display each processors utilization

I have two CPUs. The 100% is just for one of them. I still have another
CPU that will run other stuff.

And I get it from anapplet in gnome-panel. The applet will display only
one CPU, although I can select which one I want it to show.

I've seen this kind of thing before. Where have I seen it? On an
Oracle database server that was attached to a NAS via NFS. The NFS
traffic was voluminous, and it used up some serious CPU. But it didn't
show up as a userland process because it was all happening in the
kernel. Top does not show you an individual process for kernel work
unless there's some userland connector process which is doing the
heavy lifting.

So think about what you might be doing with your computer that is
exclusively working the kernel.

[jjj at Devil8 ~]$ ps -eo pcpu,pid,user,args | sort -k 1 -r | head -10
%CPU   PID USER     COMMAND
99.0 25327 root     top

So I killed top, then re-ran the command. It still listed top as 99%.

Evidently mpstat, iostat, and sar are not installed and not in the
Fedora 11 repos. I didn't look around to see if I could find an RPM for
them somewhere.

This is making sense. At least it explains why something can be eating
100% of one of my CPUs, yet nothing shows up in top or System Monitor.

Unfortunately, I know little of the kernel or how it works or what it
does. I do know how to use kernels to make popcorn, but that is about
it.

Currently open apps include Vuze (Azureus), Claws Mail, and Firefox. Of
these I suspect Vuze the most. Does a bittorrent client use processes
that are exclusively working with the kernel?

Hi Rich,

I didn't send an original message to PLUG-JOBS.  I did receive a notice
which was sent to plugjobs at bnf.net which was an address which I generated
specifically for the PLUG-JOBS list (portland) as is my practice.

That's why it was so odd to receive a notice that PLUG-JOBS was becoming a

Odder still since it looked like there was a job posting there for a gig in
Hillsboro....

http://groups.google.com/group/PurdueLUG/browse_thread/thread/d53da4ecc393d917

Hence my message to PLUG earlier today.  My apologies I should have laid it
out a little more explicitly.

The things that would cause the kernel to eat up a lot of CPU are
hardware activity, since the hardware drivers are all in the
kernel. If vuze is the culprit, then it would be mostly network
activity, i.e. NIC card. It's more likely that vuze is MISusing kernel
resources. Maybe use a lighter bittorrent client, like rtorrent. I
avoid vuze because it is a misbehaving java app from hell.

yes, we all get those.  someone at purdue (i assume) screwed something

Message-ID: <1265962305.3312.9.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Has anyone on here successfully streamed from a Silicondust HDhomerun
network based tuner to a Pentium 4 system?  I'm wondering if upgrading
from a 512 meg 2.4 Ghz P4 to a 512 meg 3.06 Ghz P4 will make a big
difference or if I'm going to need a multi core machine?  I got the
network tuner thinking more than one computer on my network could be
used to stream television only to realize, to my shock, that none of
the computers on my network in all likelihood are fast enough.

I realize that Pentium 4s are old these days, but I'm tight on money
where the point of buying a network tuner instead of a television is
to save both space and money.

If I have to get a dual core or quad core computer, I'll stop trying
to get a 3.06 Ghz P4.  Honestly, I don't get why I can't buy a hardware
card to do the mpeg translation so that I don't have to have a faster P4
or a quad core system.

It's been going on a lot longer than that, though it is getting less and
less frequent. I assume the old Purdue list will be retired and then the

There may well be another instance of top running that isn't visible anymore.

you can use ps to take a look:

$ ps -ef | grep top
creswick 21082     1  0 Feb11 ?        00:00:07 top

That tells you the process id (the first number in the line: 21082).
With that, you can kill it:

$ kill 21082

or, if you want to skipp the grepping, just kill all instances of top:

$ killall 21082

If top *still* doesn't go away (check with ps -ef | grep... and the
other ps trick that shows processor usage), you can kill it more
forcefully.

$ kill -9 <process id of top>

Please note that using -9 is *not* a good thing to do -- it's a last
resort, and you really don't want to do this to programs that access
data.  There are other ways to kill things that are better, but I've
never been able to remember them....  (this is also why I don't run
any critical servers....).

oops, i thnk you meant 'killall top'

and if it doesn't die gracefully, killall works with flags too:

killall -9 top

be warned, killall on some unices (ok, i know that aix 3, but i have
vague recollections about older solarises) does not do the same thing
and will in fact kill all processes running under the userid that runs
killall.  doing a 'sudo killall -1 inetd' brought down a server for me
once...killing all of root's processes at once turns out to be a bad
idea.  i don't think this is very common anymore (and is certainly
never the case in linux), but just, think before you shoot =)

The last time I tried Vuze, I wound up terminating it with extreme
prejudice.  It soaked up CPU, and was generally a pain to use. I seldom
use BitTorrent anyway, so deleting it was no loss.  The current (Fedora
12) default BitTorrent GNOME client works well enough for my purposes.
(Downloading new Linux distros, and that's it.)

You might want to look into using GKrellM as a system monitor.  It can
monitor all your CPUs separately, along with system temperatures, fan
speeds, voltages (assuming that your motherboard reports such things),
disk and network usage, and so on.  It's a fairly lightweight program,
too, generally staying below 7% CPU on my T40 ThinkPad.  It's also
skinnable, so that you can change its appearance.  The annoying thing
about that is that the RPM package of the skins is (was?) only available
in the Fedora 9 repository.  :-P  So I keep a copy backed up and never
erase it.  :-)

Presumably so.  Google and the MythTV wiki seem to think so, at least.

No.  Unless you think 25% more MHz at roughly the same amount and speed of
RAM is a "big difference".

Ah, that did it.

But the strange thing is that:

ps -eo pcpu,pid,user,args | sort -k 1 -r | head -10

Tells me that top is being run by root and is using 99-100% of one CPU.
However, System Monitor does not display top as running. I guess that
is because I run System Monitor as a user, not as root. 

So I ran top as root, then killed it within top. I think this was
murder made to look like suicide. In any event, then I ran:

ps -eo pcpu,pid,user,args | sort -k 1 -r | head -10

Again, and top was no longer running. And my CPU monitor applet in the
gnome-panel dropped back to its normal demure speed. I believe the
mystery is solved. 

The only question is, how did top get started by root in the first
place?

Back when I was young and needed the money, I used 'kill -9 -1' to,
uh, remotely log myself out on occasion.... the -1 pid represents
every process you own, aside from 'kill'.  That's probably not related
to your situation, (since -1 is a valid HUP signal) but it *is*
something to look out for.  Don't get the parameters mixed up, in any
case :)

kill -9 -1 still works almost as you mention and is documented in the
man page (negative PIDs are process groups, -1 is everydamnthing).
i'd never quite realized that it meant "kill all processes you CAN
kill" so running it as root is the disaster i recounted earlier from
my AIX days.

in the process, i discovered killall5 which is a clone of the tool i
spake of on aix3, which does the equivalent of the above, ie,
specifying a pid of -1 to regular kill.

i was going to chime in and say that using names for signals is far safer.

kill -HUP
kill -KILL
etc

kill -1 xxx turning into kill 1 xxx used to be a very bad thing 
(shutdown).  i haven't done that in a long time, so i'm not sure if modern 
init's respond the same way or not.

   Test and report results? :-)

   I usually start with killall <process_name>, proceed to kill <process_id>,
and as a last resort do kill -9 <process_id>. I've never used the -1 switch.

The following is not likely, but worth doing every so often.  Don't
panic, but ...

Perhaps you should try checking for a rootkit.  There might be a
rootkit program masquerading as top - that is one of the programs
that the rootkits replace to perform their nefarious deeds.  A
recent download of chkrootkit will do it.

Others might know better than I, but there are probably live CDs
that have chkrootkit and other security tools on them. A CD is
rather difficult for the bad guys to scribble on. 

The problem with some of these tools is that they are sometimes
not Logical Volume Management aware.  RHEL installs with LVM unless
you tell it not to.  The same may be true of the Fedora you are
running.  Perhaps this is obsolete information.

In any case, it is Really Handy to be able to use a security-oriented
CD to look  at your file system while it is inactive and frozen.
Even if this does not relate to your current problem, it is good
to know how to look.

This would be really nice.  I'm willing to pitch in, as time allows.
What are your ideas for first steps?

I've done this as well as contacted my ISP (Spiretech) and urged them
to submit something as well, since I figured it would carry more
weight.  If you're using a small mom&pop ISP here as I am, you might
want to do the same, since these would be the direct customers of the
Google pilot.

We could also try and convince our local city governments to submit an
application, right?  Anyone know the best people to contact?

For Michael Robinson, (and anyone else who might find this useful,)

If you want to test the ability of your computer to playback recorded HD 
video (in MPEG2 format), before investing in the hardware, try this:

1. Download and install VLC:
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
(This player has the codecs it needs to display many types of video files.)


2. Download this file:
http://www.w6rz.net/parkrun1920_18mbps.ts (141MB)

It is an MPEG2 Transport stream test file, which is recorded at the 
bit-rate that would normally broadcast as an HD 1080 channel (just shy 
of 18Mbps).
(This is a good test file IMO as, in practice, the HD 1080 programming I 
see is coming in, is around 15.93 Mbps -maximum - as recorded over clear 
QAM, by plugging directly into the Comcast wall outlet.)


3. To run the test, open the test file with the VLC application you 
installed, and observe the results. This should give you a good idea of 
whether your computer hardware is capable of displaying HD video, before 
you go out and purchase any hardware.
   

If the playback of the test file IS NOT acceptable to you (jerky, 
stutters, does not play, etc.*), and you feel you must have high 
definition, I would invest in hardware upgrades for the computer, or 
beg/borrow/buy/build a newer system.
   
* I can detect a little bit of choppiness when I play it back on my AMD 
2800+ system (2GB RAM, and NVidia FX5200 graphics card with 256MB video 
memory, relatively recent SATA disk), but the playback is good enough 
for me.
   
   
If the video playback of this test file IS acceptable to you, then I 
would go ahead and make the investment in the HDHomeRun*, or whatever 
other video capture device* you want, and you will most likely be fine.

*NOTE: You might want to make sure that whatever device you get records 
in mpeg2 format, or the test you performed here is useless. Different 
formats vary in the amount of CPU power necessary to decode them.

   
If you do not care about receiving High Definition, and are okay with 
viewing Standard Definition television, then find a tuner card that can 
handle Analog NTSC channels, and either get a digital converter box, or 
use your cable company's box, to convert the Digital broadcasts to 
Analog. This is not as CPU intensive as trying to view HD video files, 
and it should be a relatively cheap solution, until you can afford to 
build your dream system.

(I going to guess that your P4 system can handle Standard Definition 
mpeg2 streams without breaking a sweat.)

If you decide the Analog card, and converter box, option is the way you 
want to go for now, then here is a Tuner Card possibility:
   
http://www.frys.com/product/5234237?site=sr:SEARCH:MAIN_RSLT_PG
(It can do both ATSC digital, and NTSC analog, so you can use it in your 
next computer, too, as long as it has a PCI slot to put it in.)

Here is a cheap digital to analog converter box (the first one that came 
up in my search of Fry's website):
http://www.frys.com/product/5850693?site=sr:SEARCH:MAIN_RSLT_PG


I hope this helps you decide what you want to do...

as co-owner of spire, i plan to submit my two cents to google.  but i am 
not clear about what they truly are planning.  they say both "provide high 
speed internet", and "work with any service providers".  so i'm not clear 
if google is proposing a layer 2 (ethernet) or layer 3 (ip) type of 
network.

They are apparently just counting heads, so the more legitimate
"votes" the better.  Tell your friends also.

Organizing a rally with a non-pathetic number of people would be cool
also.

First, a RAM upgrade from 512MB to 1GB or more would more than likely be of
more benefit than a slight CPU upgrade within the same CPU class (as in
staying with P4 instead of upgrading to newer generation).

Second, you don't mention what kind of video hardware you have, a beefier
GPU may help.

I have an AGP slot fortunately, but whether it is 4x or 8x I am not
certain.  I am using the SIS onboard video at the moment, exactly 
what it is, I'm not sure.  Obviously there is a triple: 
processor speed, memory amount, video card capabilities.  If I have 
to upgrade in all three areas and I don't get this to work, I will 
have wasted money.

In another thread I ask about an AGP card that is a Radeon 512MB
AGP 4x/8x card with HDMI capability.  If it is adequate for the
task, I might get one.  That's a $60 investment in old tech 
though.

At least this tuner works with my Dad's quad core Windows 7 system,
I'd be ticked off if it didn't.

I realize that going from a P4 to a dual or quad core processor would
be the ideal solution, but that is also an expensive solution.  I have
a 1.80 Ghz or 2.40 Ghz processor right now. so 3.06 Ghz seems like it
would be a decent improvement.  If anyone can show me how to move up 
to a dual core system for $35-$70, let me know.

The memory is DDR 333 I believe.  Unfortunately, I have 2 sticks of 256
meg variety filling the board's two slots.  I could buy 1 512 meg stick
or maybe 1 1 gig stick and replace one of them.

The SiliconHDHomerun dual tuner cost me $107.  I'm after a 3.06 Ghz P4
that might run me $35.  I may have to buy a video card.   If I have to
buy memory too, I might be looking at $150-$200 just to upgrade one
machine.  I want to know as I explore upgrading these P4's to the max 
if ultimately that will be enough.  If it won't be enough, I'll go back
to trying to win a refurbished dual core system on Ebay.

My budget is less than $300 if at all possible to get at least one and
preferably more than one P4 upgraded adequately.

Are you sure your mobo can take a 3.06GHz processor? It needs to support 
a 533MHz FSB.

Ah, someone asked me about the lists moving to Google but was unable to
provide details... this must have been what he meant.

The odd thing is that there are no subscribers with 'csociety' or
'purdue' on the list... So I guess I'll just discard them based on sender.

My system is in the same ballpark as yours, as far as processor and
ram. The processor is an AMD Geode NX 1750, and it has ~600 MB ram. It
handles mpeg off of a DVD without a hiccup and will also display XVID
compressed video fullscreen with no problems. I think that takes more
processing power than just MPEG, but I could be wrong. (I do watch
movies on my computer, as we don't own a TV. I also compress and back
up our DVD movies to XVID so that my young son can't destroy the
originals.)

I specifically have this system: http://www.fryssupport.net/gq3151.cfm

It handled both of these things fine with the stock on board video
chip, as well as the ATI card that I had in it, and now with the
NVIDIA card that I'm currently using. It does fine in either windows
or linux.

So I assume that there's something else going on with your system that
it won't handle it. When something like that happens to me it is
usually the start of a long troubleshooting process, so I'm not the
expert that could try diagnosing over the internet like this....

Good luck!
Erik

Perfect, I was going to offer that if someone had a file I could test
and see if my combination was any good for it. It's not quite enough.
The playback is a little choppy - enough that for short term I might
be okay with it, but long term not really - when he's running. The
trees were also all very jagged whenever he was running. I'm unclear
whether that's my computer or the video file. It was gorgeous when he
was standing still. I can see the appeal of HD, even though I've never
had it.... :)

There is no sound there, right? Otherwise I have something else to
figure out in my system setup.

My video card is an NVIDIA GeForce 6200, and VLC was only using
something like 50MB of memory, but the CPU was maxed out. So, at least
for me, that was my limitation in viewing it. I'm a little
disappointed, because I hoped the video card would do a bit more of
the heavy lifting, but maybe it already was and my old computer just
can't handle it.

Erik,

I don't think there is any audible audio in this test file. If there is, 
it doesn't come through for me, either. Other mpeg2 files, that I know 
have audible sound, playback just fine...

I also have an NVidia GeForce 6200 (256MB Ram). It is in my HTPC system. 
It is a good enough card, but it is pretty old.

I keep it around because it is fanless, has a DVI connector (DVI to HDMI 
cable), and helps keep the system quiet, since it is in the living room.

The card has no problem driving an HD DLP projector, or a Sony HDTV, but 
the AMD 4000+ 2-core CPU is what is doing the heavy lifting for decoding 
video during playback.

I'm glad you found the file useful.

I have a C++ function I'm writing; see below. I'm new to C++, and the
implementation details tend to bite me where the sun don't shine
whenever they can.

The function works as intended. But later attempts to use the value
that I passed in as rawInput cause an error in Visual C++. GNU C++
does not give me any error. Nevertheless, I think that there must be a
problem here. I suspect that the pointer charSequence must need to be
freed. But I cannot find any way to do this that compiles.

Is this my problem? If so, how do I free charSequence?

Carlos:
As I see it, charSequence is an automatic variable in bool 
numericP(string rawInput) and the space for that variable does not need 
to be freed.

If you attempt to free what charSequence points to after

charSequence = rawInput.c_str();

then you are attempting to free memory starting at the address that 
rawInput.c_str() returned. I know nothing of rawInput, but I suspect you 
don't want to free that memory here. I suspect that wherever the 
rawInput structure / class was "newed" is where that should happen and 
the rawInput structure / class should free the memory holding the 
string. Is it possible that rawInput is some sort of utility that 
handles deleting / newing when rawInput is updated?

But from the declaration up above, rawInput is a string. You don't
delete C++ style strings, do you? Isn't that an automatic feature? Is
it also named rawInput outside of this function? (Not that that's a
problem, just wondering where you're accessing it and how when it's
failing.)

charSequence should not be messed with as far as trying to delete it.
That gets taken care of automatically by the compiler.
http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/general/15529/

What is the error? I'm not an expert, but I've had to take a few
classes and deal with Visual C++ and it's sometimes bizarre error
reporting.

Also I wouldn't mind running your code through the compiler and taking
a look. But like I said, I'm just a student myself, just a little
ahead of you in C++. Of course I would need the rest of it, too.

As the other responders pointed out, you don't.  The problem appears to be,
and I'm guessing here, that the deletion of the automatic variable
charSequence is somehow affecting the original rawInput instance, like maybe
deleting the contents there.  Since your function declaration uses the 'call
by value'  method (pass in a copy) rather than the 'call by reference'
method (pass in a pointer), things are a little more obscured.

What is the error message from Visual C++?

What is the value of rawInput in the g++ version after the call returns?

So I wrote a test program, using your function and g++:

#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {

    string rawInput("1234567");
    cout << rawInput << endl;
    printf ("%s\n", rawInput.c_str());
    bool rslt = numericP(rawInput);
    cout << rawInput << endl;
}


Of course,  I have no idea what your calling code looks like, so I went
minimal.  As you said,  g++ likes it just fine, and rawInput is intact upon
return.

Please give us a code example of what you mean when you say 'But later
attempts to use the value that I passed in as rawInput'.

OK, I put up a Visual C++ zip file at:

   http://mirror.wrlug.org/code-samples/3trianglesAndDiamonds.win32.zip

Naturally my real-life code is not exactly the same as what I posted
earlier. I was trying to avoid (what I thought to be) undue
complexity. I don't really pass in any arguments; it's a method that
acts upon other class members. The treatment of the input string needs
to be examined in the proper context.

If you look in Validate.cpp, you will see the following two methods:



bool Validator::numericP() {
     bool legalCharsP = true;
     int numDecimalPoints = 0;
     int i = 0;
     const char *charSequence = getRawInput().c_str();
     while(i < getRawInput().size() && legalCharsP && numDecimalPoints <= 1) {
         // the first char can be a -, ., or a digit; all others must
         // be a . or a digit; but there can be only one or less .'s
         if(! ((i == 0 && charSequence[i] == 0x2d) ||
               ((charSequence[i] >= 0x30 && charSequence[i] <= 0x39) || charSequence[i] == 0x2e))) {
             legalCharsP = false;
         } else if(charSequence[i] == 0x2e) {
             numDecimalPoints++;
         }
         i++;
     }
     return (legalCharsP && numDecimalPoints <= 1);
}

int Validator::validate() {
     int num = 0;
     // DEBUG: this if() statement, when run in Windows, causes
     // some sort of curruption of rawInput, as evidenced by the
     // fact that calling getRawInput() fails with a NaNException
     if(! numericP()) {
         throw NaNException();
     }
     // this throws a NaNException in Windows
     cout << getRawInput() << endl;
     coerceStringToNumeric(getRawInput(), num);
     if(num < 1 || num > 80) {
         throw OutOfRangeException();
     }
     return num;
}



After the call to numericP(), any attempt to call getRawInput() throws
the exception. I put in a super-simple, gratuitous cout to illustrate
this. And here is the error message:

Unhandled exception at 0x7642b727 in 3trianglesAndDiamonds.exe:
Microsoft C++ exception: NaNException at memory location 0x0035fa00..

Which occurs on the line:

   cout << getRawInput() << endl;

Commenting out the "if(! numericP()) {}" block circumvents the
error. Therefore it seems reasonable that something in numericP() is
causing the trouble. That's what led me to look at the treatment of
the *char. Now I think it's corrupting rawInput().

Is it bad to keep using getRawInput() directly whenever I want to read
its value, instead of getting a copy into a local variable? This would
cause no problems in Java, Lisp, etc, but perhaps C++ is
different. I'll try changing that.

I appreciate all your help thus far. It is good to know that I should
not bark up the free() tree.

Carlos

The corruption may be that member function getRawInput() itself has been
nuked, or that member variable rawInput has been nuked, or that the  table
holding the info about class members has been nuked,  Since I can't see how
a simple reference to the variable or the function call could produce a NaN
to trigger the exception, I lean toward the last one, which involves an
index into a lookup table, if I recall my C++ Class implementation details
correctly.   This would mean that the corruption is way bad, caused by
writing memory locations gone wild, for example.

One point about accessors (eg, get/setRawInput):  they are generally for
access from the 'outside world', part of the information hiding paradigm.
Inside a class instance, member variables are directly accessible, unless
you go to some extraordiary lengths to make them not so.  I would not use

For some reason that last line was interpreted as a quote.  I'll try again:

const char* charSequence = rawInput.c_str();

Message-ID: <1266193943.4945.5.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I have temperature values in Kelvin corresponding to vapor pressure
values in kPa's.  I need to graph natural_log(vapor pressure) as Y
and (1/temperature) for the X axis.  How do I do this in Openoffice
Calc???    I should end up with a straight line, but I probably won't.

A problem is that my initial vapor pressure is 0, no ethanol in the

I will try this advice. How different C/C++ is from other
languages. Implementation details are something to learn about and
deal with. Keeps the mind sharp.

I believe that that might not work as you expect. you don't own the
position of the return pointer from c_str(), so you can't guarantee
when it will still be around. (Well C++ gurus possibly could, but I
don't know.)

Therefore I would make your own variable pointer. And new[] it with
the length of the rawInput + 1. Then use strcpy() to copy over the
char array from one to the other.

IE:
    char * charSequence = new char[rawInput.length()+1];
    strcpy(charSequence, rawInput.c_str());

Then of course you need to use delete[] when you are done with it.

But I haven't had a chance to check it in Visual C++ yet. Hopefully
I'll get a look at it in a little bit after kids are asleep. If not
tonight it won't be until tomorrow evening that I'll get a chance.

Having the natural log of 0 might be an issue. I'm pretty sure that
the natural log of 0 would be negative infinity. That would likely not
produce a straight line graph....

Just have two extra rows where you do your computations. ( =LN(A1)
and =1/B1 ) for example. Then just copy and paste and it will give you
your whole series.

Then make the chart from those pre-computed values.

(But isn't a vapor pressure of 0 a vacuum? Is it not 1 for something
at equilibrium in a lab environment? I could be really misremembering,
of course.)

Your point about guarantees on the existence of the result of the call to *
c_str()* is well taken.  The features of string member function
*c_str()*are explained here:
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/c_str/ .  One of the things
it says is that the existence of that result is only guaranteed until the
next call to a non-constant member function.  I'm thinking that this is the
crux of the matter, and that implementations differ between the VC++ and
g++.  The fact that my suggested modification seems to have worked for
Carlos, in my opinion, does not imply the 'correctness' of the solution.
Working within the restrictions of the defined behavior, however, would seem
to be the way to go.

The way I read it, as long as I don't call any further methods on
rawInput after the *char assignment, I am OK. I violate this rule by
calling rawInput.size(). So I will capture the size of the string
before the *char assignment, and all will be golden.

You can take care of that with one or another expediency.  One thing you 
can do is calculate using the 'if': if(that cell == 0; 0; ln(that 
cell)).  The other thing you can do is to just don't graph the first point.

It wouldn't be 1 for something in a sealed container.  Perfectly 0 is 
unachievable, too, but "down in the noise", certainly.

Perhaps he's introducing ethanol into an evacuated flask.

I would take that under advisement -- sometimes you _do_ want to use a 
class's accessor functions from within the class, particularly when its 
large and complex (and maybe due to be split up) or when you know that 
you will always need the information as presented to the outside world 
and you suspect that you're going to change the internal representation.

I'd do this with Scilab -- but my threshold for wanting to use Scilab

I agree. Getters and setters are not just for avoiding direct access
of a member; they are for encapsulating logic that may need to be
performed every time a member is accessed. GNU GCC does a fine job of
not exposing implementation bugs when using accessors. Microsoft's
compiler has glitches.

But I did have a bug in my code. I called rawInput.size() after using
c_str(). The spec says that there is no guarantee that the temporary
buffer containing the copy of the string to which my *char points will
survive such an event. Once you call c_str(), you have to be sure to
leave the original string alone.

Yet this bug didn't affect my Microsoft problem; using an ordinary
string variable in place of a getter call is what fixed it for me
(i.e. copying the result of calling getRawInput() into a scalar
variable, and using the variable). If c_str() makes a copy of the
string into a temp buffer, why should it matter that I called a
function that returned a string, or performed a calculation that
returned a string, or did anything else that ends up being a string?
That's a transgression against functional programming style.

I am so glad that I am going through the extra work of writing my code
in Linux, and then copying it into Windows for final packaging. It is
teaching me loads about C++ whenever I see something not work that
should.

You are extracting individual characters out of rawInput by getting a 
pointer to a character array, then getting characters 'the C way'.

Yet the string class has a character extraction operator -- why not just 
use rawInput[i], or rawInput.at(i)?

...or iterator members rawInput.begin() and rawInput.end() to avoid using
size() at all?
modified example from the string RefMan entry:
string::iterator it;
for  (it = rawInput.begin(); it < rawInput.end(); it++) {
    if (*it == 0x2e) {
         etc, etc, etc

Indeed, I should have mentioned it.  I _thought_ it, but then I thought 
it'd be hard to explain, so I didn't pursue it.

That's probably how I'd carry out the task, if I couldn't use the 
higher-level parsing functions available from string (like find, substr, 
etc.).  I'd have to think about it to know if they could be used to 
advantage -- I do nearly all my C++ work in small embedded systems where 
use of the STL is anathema.

Message-ID: <4B79E3E9.8060909@gmail.com>

I just discovered this and would be geek'd outta my pants to have 
someone give a talk on this at PLUG Adv Topics...

MeeGo combines Intel?s Moblin and Nokia?s Maemo projects at the Linux 
Foundation to create one open source uber-platform for the next 
generation of computing devices: tablets, pocketable computers, 
netbooks, automotive IVI and more.

Why should you pay attention to this announcement? With MeeGo you have 
the world?s largest chip manufacturer and the world?s largest mobile 
handset manufacturer joining forces to create an incredible opportunity 
for developers who want to reach millions of users with innovative 
technology.

It'll be interesting to see where this goes, I saw the announcement
come across the Moblin Dev mailing list this morning and was pretty
surprised.

   My sister has had an account with yahoo for her mail and, naturally
enough, gets a ton of spam. She's moving in a few weeks and her new apartment
comes with access to Comcast (I believe) so she'll drop the yahoo account.
And, she would like to have her mail addressed to one of my domains to take
advantage of the postfix and spamassassin filters in place here.

   Do she need an account on the local server before I can forward mail to
her? I'm not sure of the postfix processing sequence; whether incoming
messages are checked for a valid (i.e., known) user before being forwarded.

   I'm sure a bunch of folks here provide this filtering and forwarding
service for family and friends (and paying clients, too) so any suggestions,
recommendations, and advice you have will be welcome.

I have a virtual setup, which requires no local account in
/etc/passwd. I can tell you all about it. But not right now, for I am
about to go to class. If no one else steps up, I'll help a brother out.

I wouldn't drop the yahoo account in favor of a Comcast account. With a
yahoo account she is free to change service providers whenever she wants and
keep the same email address.  If she decides to drop Comcast then she will
have to go through all the trouble of changing her email address again. My
experience with yahoo is that their spam filters are not that bad.

Note that the concept as presented is for Rich to give his sister an email
address on one of his existing domains, which will then be forwarded to her
Comcast address for storage. This can be ported to wherever and follow her
to new providers.

Carlos,

Bill,

   She doesn't like yahoo. She could always get a gmail account if she wants
something free. Regardless, while I don't recall the details the new place
has either wired or wireless access as part of the rent. Can't beat that,
even with a recycled-rubber whip.

Then why did he ask the question "Do[es] she need an account on the 
local server before I can forward mail to her?" if he's providing the 
account?

Honestly, I'm with Bill. I can't imagine why anyone would switch to an 
ISP specific account over one without that limitation. If Yahoo sucks, 
then switch to Gmail and set it to fetch the yahoo mail. You get the 
SPAM filtering, retain the portability, and spent less time doing it 
than pondering this thread, let alone all the setup and future support 
on Rich's end.

He's providing the email address. This is not necessarily an account. He
wants to know if an actual user account is required on his system in order
for the address to exist and be forwarded.

Again, she is not switching to an ISP specific account. Please read the
initial message.

Also, Yahoo doesn't support external access without paying for it.

OT: FiOS BBU auxiliary power

We lost electrical power for four days in ours due to the recent snow
Using FiOS for phone means that when the Battery Backup Unit (BBU)
battery runs down (7-8 hours) there is no more phone.

We have the CPL28U12 BBU (that is an APC number as well - same unit)
which supposedly can accept an auxiliary power supply, but I am having
difficulty identifying one and the capabilities of same.

So far all Verizon has been able to say is they don't think the aux port
is active?

Anyone?
Thank you for any help you may be able to offer

Here's a link to the manual for the auxiliary backup unit, model number
CP20B12BP.

I'm sure you could just wire up a car battery directly to the terminals if
you could tell which wire went where.

On our FIOS power supply, there is a jack for a barrel connector
that says "Auxilliary power 12V DC" coming off the BBU.  I'm guessing
that could be connected to a different "12V" source, a car battery
perhaps.  The barrel connector is small (4mm WAG???) and I don't
have a connector to check that with.

There is a discussion and further pointers here:
http://www.payne.org/index.php/Verizon_FiOS

Apparently, there is an auxiliary unit that extends lifetime, but
not by much.

Personally, I want to construct a BBU that keeps both phone and
internet going indefinitely.  Probably plugging the whole thing
into a beefy UPS system, perhaps bypassing the unit with the wimpy
little gel cell.

Off the same UPS, I would like to be able to charge the laptops,
and keep the routers going if the power goes out for a few days.  
I'm guessing 150 watts.  I expect that would require a few deep
discharge marine batteries, an inverter, and my generator (with
a 12V output!) to top them off every day or so.

The problem is, the more batteries I have around, the more
maintenance needed to tend to them.  To bring this on topic,
perhaps there are some open source apps that help maintain
batteries.

Sorry - that is a CP20B12BP - I have a CPL28U12, but I have the manual 
for that and I see what you mean - but it would be me in the cross hairs 
if I mess the system doing that - so I am looking for the "off the 
shelf" answer first

The link I sent you is for the backup unit that is designed to plug into
what you have. My intention was not to send you the manual for the device
you already have.

   She wants a mail address at one of my domains. I can set up virtual tables

Just a quick note: this should be a very accessible talk to people who 
haven't done any embedded Linux development before, so don't get scared 
away by the subject and fact that this is an "Advanced Topics" meeting.

Also, I will be bringing a sound system with me to help overcome the

(1) APS did indeed make the BBU in question under their Power Shield
line/group, but they stopped making Power Shield products a while ago
(according to APS)
(2) If the auxiliary battery pack is available, it would have to be
purchased through the broadband provider (according to APS)
(3) The auxiliary battery pack is not available (according to Verizon)
(4) Reverting from FiOS digital voice (phone) to POTS (coper) voice is
not possible (according to Verizon)
(5) Batteries Plus sells replacement batteries for the unit, and a
charger for the battery, too (< $30 for the charger, < $40 for the
battery, I was told)
(6) One could of course attempt to become one's own power company

   Think big: your own nuclear power generator in the back yard. There's now
up to $8.3 billion in loan guarantees and this generation process produces
no airborne sulfides or particles and does not restrict salmonid migrations.
Can't lose! And, if it's in the back yard it will acquire a layer of moss so
it qualifies as green energy.

If you're ok with the downtime when you're replacing the batteries while the
power is out, this is a perfectly viable option.

Fred,

   I have a vague recollection of a thread on this mail list several years
ago when Verizon first offered their FiOS service and this point was raised.
IIRC, it depended on the technician who istalled the glass. If he left the
copper installed it could be used as a fall-back. Perhaps over time the
telco decided to remove that option.

This is why I said it depends on who you talk to. It's a political decision
rather than a technical one, so if one were to make enough noise, it should
be possible to overcome it.

Worst case: cancel service and start a new account, possibly with a
different name. They can't force the next person that moves into the same
house to use FiOS (not yet at least).

This all gets even more interesting when we consider that Verizon is selling
off half their FiOS customers to another company. I haven't heard for sure
whether Oregon is included; my guess is yes.

They have asked to sell their wireline business in Oregon and other
states to Frontier Communications.  Regulators have not given their
approval so far and have expressed scepticism, as i understand it.

Subject: [PLUG] GCC verses Visual Studio...
Message-ID: <1266454000.3276.17.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Is it true that Mozilla Firefox for Windows is commonly compiled using
Microsoft's Visual Studio?  If that is the case, I suspect a legal
problem.  The ReactOS project insists on supporting Microsoft Visual C
compilation over mingw(GCC) compilation!  Two things get thrown in 
your face if you linger in the ReactOS forums for any length of time.
First thing is that GCC is supposedly crap and that MSVC is supposedly
awesome.  One reason this kind of rhetoric is stupid is that GCC is open
source and it can be fixed if it has a problem.  I think legally that
trying to compile a Windows clone and give it away for free using MSVC
to compile it is asking for litigation.

What is structured exception handling and what is the philosophy
pertaining to it as far as GCC is concerned?

Is it true that many of the "open source" projects on Sourceforge are
designed to be compiled via Microsoft Visual Studio?

What is the truth about Visual Studio being "free?"  I don't buy the
free bit and I think there is a danger in trusting Microsoft, but many
in the ReactOS community think I'm nuts for saying so.

Why is it so hard to find the Microsoft EULA for Visual Studio Express
2010?  The best I can seem to do is grab bits and pieces of old EULA's.

The video for this is up at http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/4808334 although I
use the term "video" loosely.  Mostly dark human-like shapes against a
too-light background, followed by very dark impossible to read text sometimes
obscured by the outline of a human shape. :)

The audio is mostly listenable, and has a lot of good content, but the
acoustics of the room are not very good for recording (too echoey).

Thanks, Randall for recording the audio. My slides are available on 
SlideShare as well as being posted to my blog:

http://blog.zenlinux.com/?p=316

I really appreciate everyone who came out to hear my talk.

Also, I am considering trying to improve upon this presentation and 
possibly submitting for the Open Source Bridge conference in June. So if 
anyone has any critical feedback that would help me do a better job next 
time, I'd very much like to hear it (off-list preferred).

Thanks,

Anyone have direct experience with one of these in CentOS or Slackware?

I'm trying to download something called the catalyst driver from AMD.

I've noticed that X is too slow since I've switch from my old Radeon 
without HDMI port to this one.

Is it normal to plug in both the HDMI port and the vga port on the same
monitor?

Subject: [PLUG] OpenEmbedded follow-up questions.
Message-ID: <4B7DBAA9.9090602@zenlinux.com>

Hello,

I thought I'd answer a few questions that came up at the meeting last 
night that I wasn't able to answer on the spot:

Q: Does OpenEmbedded support any devices that don't have an MMU?

I'm not familiar with too many MMU-less architectures, and my grepping 
around the machine configurations didn't lead to much. However I don't 
see any reason why OE couldn't be used to generate images for devices 
without an MMU.

Q: Does OpenEmbedded build bootloaders too?

Yes, in fact I'm seeing many u-boot recipes for various boards in the 
repository:

http://cgit.openembedded.net/cgit.cgi/openembedded/tree/recipes/u-boot

Q: Are there any tools for running compile farms for BitBake jobs?

Take a look at icecc, a distributed compile system. There are a few 
references to it being used by folks on the OE mailing list.

Q: What makes ipkg so different/better than dpkg for embedded systems?

I think this turned out to be a lot of little things that added up. One 
of the main differences is that ipkg's metadata takes up a lot less disk 
space than dpkg. Also, dpkg by itself isn't very usable without the 
apt-get front end. I may have been playing a bit too fast and loose with 
the ipkg vs. dpkg comparisons; ipkg vs. apt-get would be more appropriate.

In other ways ipkg became smaller by removing support for some things 
that apt has, such as package signing. That feature loss in particular 
created some controversy in the community, and the OpenMoko project 
forked it not long ago to create the opkg system, which appears to be on 
its way to being adopted by OpenEmbedded.

A co-worker of mine mentioned to me today that ipkg ticked him off when 
he learned that it wasn't reporting errors via its exit status 
correctly. This made it impossible to use properly within scripts (he 
had to parse the output of the command instead, blech). Apparently opkg 
resolves this bug as well.

Subject: [PLUG] experiments - OT: FiOS auxiliary power for BBU
Message-ID: <20100219011818.GA23217@gate.kl-ic.com>

I fiddled a bit with the "Auxilliary Power Supply DC 12V" input to
my FIOS BBU.

The barrel connector seems to be a 0.15 inch barrel (approximately
6mm), center positive.  I clipped the connector and cable off an
obsolete wall wart, and proceeded.  This is the same power connector
as some of the older Nokia cell phones, IIRC.

I set up a lab bench power supply with current and voltage limits,
and connected it to the cable.  When I increased the voltage above
12.5V , the "Auxilliary Power Source" light on the front panel lit
up.  The BBU drew less than 10mA.  I dialed it up to 13.5V, about
what a car battery puts out, and set the current limit to 5 amps.
Since the unit draws 20W from the line in normal operation, I 
assumed that would be enough.

I pulled the line power input to the BBU, the unit went on battery
as intended.  I pulled the internal battery connection, hoping it
would use the auxiliary power instead of the internal battery,
and the BBU shut down, without drawing current from the auxiliary
jack and bench supply.  It might have been a startup surge, so I
tried again with 0.086 farads across the supply.  Again, shut
down, no current from the bench supply.  I don't want to try a car
battery directly, too much current if something shorts.

So - a mystery.  Perhaps there is some protocol on the wire to the
approved external device.  For extended life, use an external UPS
on the line input, I guess.

According to what I have read (online manual for the unit I have 
(CPL28U12) - you didn't mention your model) ... you are/were almost 
there ... there is (again, on my model) a button marked "Battery 
Emergency Use" (next to the Alarm Silence button), which (although 
Verizon fails to mention it in their documentation) is intended for 
emergency use as follows ...
     "Press the button once to use the reserve battery capacity and/or 
the auxiliary battery capacity after low battery shutdown.  The unit 
will emit a confirmation beep."
... as an additional note, the battery is a 12 V 7.2 AHr battery - I am 
not sure what that would equal in amps from a bench power supply, but I 
don't think that was the cause of the NoGo in your test, as you didn't 
mention pushing the Battery Emergency Use button.
Thanks for the input - that sounds (correct me if I am wrong) as if one 
were to connect the free ends (say with alligator clips attached?) of a 
cable of the description you gave above to a fully charged 12 V 7.2 AHr 
battery (i.e., the same type as the one in the unit itself), and the 
barrel end of that cable  to the BBU auxiliary port provided, one could 
be good to go?  First making sure polarity on the cable was correct, of 
course.

We had to use this driver for something just a littler older.
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV610 [Radeon
HD 2400 XT]

We needed it to get dual displays working in CentOS5.   A newer
version of X would handle it correctly
but getting all of X to compile is always a pain.

If you've gone digital on a monitor then it is very noticeable when
you switch back.

If you are using the same monitor for two different machines then yes.

I can use netcat and telnet to send emails on the local machine. I do not
know if the ISP is blocking port 25 or not as I was able to run postfix on a
previous server using the same ISP. Using GRC's Shields UP I ran a port scan
and it showed Port 25 as stealth mode, will this prevent smtp from working

I am using pfsense and believe firewall rules are in order. Would a port
being in Stealth Mode instead of Open create the problem. The only thing I
can come up with is that Embarq and Centurytel combined and after the merger
may have blocked the incoming port.

Can you telnet from a remote machine that's not on the local network?
Maybe grab an account at free shell to test? Stealth mode implies it's
being filtered in some way I think.

I was waiting on a friend to run a scan on my ip to find out if the port was
being blocked, but I never thought of signing up for a free shell account to
test. Thanks for the input.

The procedure did not work with the battery totally unplugged.  Perhaps
it works with a low - but not 0V - battery.  I will see if I can
arrange one.

That might be worth a try.  Perhaps the unit actually senses a 
battery (rather than a power supply ) out there.  A small gel cell
battery has a different impedance and capacitance than a power
supply, or a car battery, for that matter.

Does the auxiliary device have a separate charger, or is it charged
by the main unit?

In addition to the http://freeshell.org already recommended:

http://lmgtfy.com/?q=free+shell

(remember: it's a joke, of sorts)

ok, I tried freeshell.org but they wanted me to upgrade for a fee to use
telnet. I don't know what is going on, reconfigured some firewall settings
and now GRC Shields UP shows port 25 as open but still cannot receive mail.

Amp-hours vs. amps isn't entirely meaningless, but it's not terrifically 
meaningful in a battery vs. bench supply shoot-off.  Battery capacity is 
rated in amp-hours, which along with the voltage tells you roughly how 
much energy is stored in the thing.  A battery's ability to deliver 
current is measured in amps.  All else being equal, a bigger amp-hour 
rating indicates a greater ability to deliver current, but there are 
potentially huge differences in construction from one battery to the 
next which drastically affects the capacity vs. current-delivering 
capability trade off.

(Having said that, most sealed gel-cell batteries for equipment power 
use are mostly designed for a minimum 10-hour discharge time, meaning 
you wouldn't want to pull more than 720mA out of that 7.2A-hr battery, 
and you could expect it to last 10 hours in that service).

Putting a bigger battery on there will give you a longer discharge time, 
but may confuse the heck out of any charging circuit they may have built 
into the thing.

Thank you for the clarification
The APC documentation indicates stringing one or more "battery packs" to 
the BBU - if one were to try to duplicate this with just batteries and 
wire, I am assuming (pardon my ignorance here) that one would want to 
wire those extra batteries in parallel - is that true?  IIRC parallel (+ 
to + and - to -) delivers the same current but for longer, and series (+ 
to - as in a flash light) delivers a higher voltage but not for longer?
Thanks again
Regards
Fred James

"but not with a 0V battery" - I don't know - from the documentation one 
might expect the BBU to shutdown leaving some "reserve" power in the battery
Now, Verizon "tech" did say the aux port wasn't hooked up, but APC 
couldn't understand that statement - i.e.: APC's documents contradict 
Verizon's statement - but I don't know how to verify that either way?

If one could acquire the suggested auxiliary device (some have suggested 
that one could), it is supposed to contain a battery charger as well
A local battery store (Batteries Plus) claims to have both the 
replacement battery (<$40) for the BBU, and a separate charger (<$30) 
for the battery, although I have not been to see them as yet.

Correct..

In parallel it is + to + etc...

The problem is...Unless the batteries have identical Voltage the most
positive battery will see the other battery as a load and discharge into
it for some period of time.  Till the charges are equal..

YMMV

Verizon is not in the business of telling the truth.  They are in the
business of keeping their equipment safe from hardware hackers like us.
Obviously, there are risks, starting with some clown hooking a car
battery backwards into that port.  If I was programming an Indian call
center, I would have them say whatever was necessary to keep people like
us from fooling with the customer equipment.  I'm grateful that they 
were willing to help me plug into the ethernet port on the ONT, rather
than route through the Actiontec cable modem as originally installed
(another story).  They could have told me to jump in a lake.

The aux port does hook up to the aux indicator light, and there is a
12.5V threshold, so it is not just a matter of an otherwise-unconnected
LED and resistor.  I imagine that under the right circumstances, the 
port will provide power though the BBU.

I'm guessing that replacing the good battery with an almost-but-not-quite
discharged one will cause the main BBU to draw power from the aux port.
The BBU control circuitry that does the switching may be powered off the
main internal battery, drawing a trickle of current.

If the external APC unit has a charger, then that is good news, because
it means the main APC unit is not trying to charge it, and probably
does not care how big the external battery is.  Car batteries are much
cheaper per watt-hour than the small gel cells, and you can keep them
on a trickle charger.  In extremis, you could even power the unit from
the battery in a car, BUT DO NOT CONNECT IT WHEN THE CAR IS RUNNING,
the ignition spikes would likely kill the APC BBU.

If you're looking for inexpensive lead-acid batteries for this service, 
look to deep discharge marine, RV or golf cart batteries.  Car batteries 
are optimized to generate LOTS of current for a short time, and are 
presumed to rarely get deeply discharged.  This is because that current 
is needed, and they generally still have considerable remaining capacity 
when they're too 'dead' to turn an engine.  As a consequence of being 
optimized for low price and high current output they don't do a good job 
controlling where the material plates on during charge after a deep 
discharge, so they tend to suffer an early death if they go through too 
many deep discharge/charge cycles.

There is considerable collected wisdom on this subject in the amateur 
radio literature, from folks building emergency-power stations suitable 
for the aftermath of fire, flood, and earthquake.  They all say "don't 
use car batteries".

Anything called "deep discharge" will (well, should) be designed to be 
deeply discharged -- and recharged -- on a regular basis, and will 
probably severely compromise cold cranking amps while doing so.

The more common term that I've seen used is "deep cycle."

Subject: [PLUG] Restoring the original netbook OS when no media supplied
Message-ID: <20100219215635.GQ18091@spiritone.com>

This is a rant, a warning, and a request for help.  The help part: any
ideas on how to get Windows 7 Starter onto a netbook for which it's
licensed without buying a disk?

The story: we've been waiting for the "Pinetrail" version of the Atom
to show up in netbooks, and so when Costco started carrying the
Samsung N-150 I snapped one up.  As soon as it arrived I installed
Ubuntu "Netbook Remix".  The installer for that distro doesn't support
LVM and won't let you install without creating a swap partition, so a
minimum of two partitions were required.  Samsung's setup used three,
so I wiped it, figuring I could restore later (after enabling LVM and
freeing up the swap partition), and moved on.

Big mistake.  The device does not ship with any recovery media.
Worse, Samsung doesn't make disks available (doesn't even sell them),
and won't honor the warranty on the device unless it's running the
software it shipped with.  (I didn't ask what happens if you have a
virus that wipes your drive, having already admitted that I'd wiped
mine on-purpose.)  There was nothing in the packaging to tell me I was
losing the warranty -- but that's not really my problem because Costco
has a great return policy. :-)

That said, I'd rather keep the device if I can set it up to dual-boot
to keep the warranty intact.  If not, consider yourselves warned away
from an otherwise excellent product.  I wonder how much Samsung's
saving much by not including recovery media (as, e.g., Acer does on
similar products I've purchased).

Can anybody suggest strategies for restoring?  If, for example, I
could find somebody with an unmolested similar model is it likely that
dd-ing the first few gigs of the HD (where the special boot blocks and
recovery partition lie) would work?

Thanks,

--Eric

A few things I notice:

-I have not in my experience heard or seen a netbook, which has no optical
drive, including any kind of restore media.
The only one I have actually purchased myself is an Acer Aspire One, but I
have seen and worked on several others.
Mine came with WinXP, and no restore media.  (It is dual boot WinXP and
Fedora now)
I will have to double check but I don't think it has a typical restore
partition either.
IMHO, for similar price as it used to cost to include restore media, the
manufacturers might include a USB flash drive with restore media on it, or
at least a recovery partition with some kind of automated "install to flash
drive" type option.

-NEVER admit you wiped it yourself to the techs.... ;)  Just say a friend
was messing around with it, and contracted a mean ole virus.

-There are guides on the net out there for putting a Win7 installer on a USB
flash drive.  If you can get a copy of Win7, you can put it on a flash drive
and install from that.  You could use for ex. Parted (or Gparted or Qparted)
and create a blank partition at the beginning of the drive for Win7, moving
the Linux partitions down.

Based on my understanding of the Visual Studio 2008 Standard Edition 
EULA 
<http://download.microsoft.com/documents/useterms/Visual%20Studio_2008%20Standard%20Edition_English_4c240268-8ee9-4cf3-96cf-3bd5ef02a81f.pdf>, 
there shouldn't be any problem using a Visual C/C++ compiler instead of 
GCC, so long as you have a license to do so. This is, of course, 
assuming that neither Mozilla Firefox or ReactOS are either breaching 
copyrights held by Microsoft or trying to claim code Microsoft wrote as 
their own. If either of these two assumptions are false, it wouldn't 
matter what compiler you are using; you could expect legal trouble 
sooner or later.

The truth about Visual Studio being "free" is that it is free as in 
beer, not as in freedom to modify Visual Studio's source code (though 
you can write add-ins for it). What that means is that you are permitted 
to use Visual Studio to do commercial development, so long as you are 
either using a commercially-licensed version of Visual Studio or are 
using an Express Edition (for more information about using the Express 
Editions for commercial development, see 
http://www.microsoft.com/express/Support/Support-faq.aspx and scroll 
down to "Can I use Express Editions for commercial use"). If you are 
using a student version, you /cannot/ use it to do commercial 
development. But the short answer for those living and developing the 
brave GNU world is that using Visual Studio for FOSS development is 
perfectly legal and is really a question of personal taste, personal 
views, and technology preferences.

I can burn Win7 media for you that has Starter on it. You use the key on 
the bottom of the Netbook. The easiest way to install would be to use an 
external USB DVD drive and boot from that. Otherwise look at the link 
above. MS supplies tool, you still need an ISO.

This won't solve your problem, but I am curious. The last several laptop 
type computers that friends have purchased did not include recovery 
media. One of the first tasks for the purchaser was to make it. Was that 
the situation with your Samsung? Or have things gotten even screwier?

   As an aside, the Toshiba Satellite low-end laptop we bought a couple of
months ago did not come with official OS restoration media. However, when
Best Buy had their techies check the unit before it was put up for sale the
techies made a couple of disks and gave them to us. Although we'd have no
use for them if the unit worked, I took them and appreciated their efforts.

What will Microsoft think of the ReactOS project trying to use Microsoft
Visual Studio Express to compile a GPL'ed Windows compatible operating
system?  Is GCC inadequate because of Microsoft's structured exception
handling?  I don't think Microsoft ever intended to hand a compiler to
people intent on bringing an end to shrink wrapped multi hundred dollar
copies of Windows.

Does the Linux Unified Kernel project use Microsoft tools?

I ran into a similar problem a couple years ago with a new HP computer - the 
then-current linux drivers wouldn't properly support the HP sata host 
adaptor. I called HP customer service, complained, and they ended up sending 
me a set of recovery disk in the mail at no charge. You could try the same 
thing with Samsung. Might work.

Buy another identical netbook, image the disk to the other netbook
(bunch of ways to do this), then return the second netbook.  Be sure
to ask if there is a restocking fee or similar.

Just an FYI: one can think about almost all of the *ubuntus as a
minimal Ubuntu Server install plus some desktop.  For example, Kubuntu
is Ubuntu Server + kubuntu-desktop.  Xubuntu is Ubuntu Server +
xubuntu-desktop.  Standard Ubuntu is Ubuntu Server + ubuntu-desktop.
And UNR is Ubuntu Server + mobile-netbook-remix.  So if you want UNR
with LVM, install a minimal Ubuntu Server, partitioning with LVM, and
then use 'sudo tasksel install mobile-netbook-remix'

FWIW, the above is not 100% correct, but close enough for government work.

Good luck and let us know how things go.

The next dual boot system you build, consider these ideas.
Use two disks. One for OS's, the other for data.
The OS disk can be fairly small, figure 15-20 GB per OS.
Of course for data, the bigger the better. Create a generous vfat 
partition, this can be accessed with either OS.

I bought an Asus eeeBox -- a netbook in effect but packaged for
desktop use with external monitor and keyboard/mouse -- in Nov. '08
and it came with restore media, though it had no optical drive.
Googling for help resolving my problem I found lots of folks talking
about borrowing external drives to use with their restore media.

I work for a smartphone manufacturer, and even we provide downloadable
tools that when run from a desktop computer will allow users to
restore a bricked phone.  We are in a better position than Samsung
because we own our OS -- we don't need to accomodate MS's piracy
paranoia in our quest to reduce our customer service call volume --
but at the least Samsung needs to be upfront about what actions void
their warranty.  The damned thing has PXE-boot built into the BIOS or
ROM: boot it on a network and it goes looking for an OS to install.
Clearly at some point in the design process they had a recovery option
planned.  But now the policy has changed.

(My spouse, a Lewis & Clark Law grad, suspects their warranty refusal
wouldn't survive a challenge.  I'm not challenging it, however, as
getting a refund from Costco takes a lot less of my time.  It's a
shame, though, as this is a sweet Linux netbook: everything, down to
suspend/resume and wifi, works with all-FOSS software.)

Or a DVD with an .exe on it that run under Windows makes the thumb
drive you supply into a booable installer.  Many of us could write
such an app in a few days.  As a customer I wouldn't object to
spending $20 on a thumb drive to recover from my f*ckup.  But having
no options at all isn't acceptable.

Too late for that.  I started with Costco's (excellent, BTW)
"concierge" service and figured I could be honest with them since we
both knew I had the option of a no-questions-asked refund.  It had not
occurred to me that Samsung wouldn't have recovery disks available at
any price.

I may still try this.  Have I mentioned I like this thing? :-)

I bought a consumer-grade PC from HP a couple of years ago that
required me to burn backup DVDs if I wanted them.  IIRC, the software
limited me to one set of DVDs.  The "customization" phase of ordering
a consumer-grade laptop from HP currently offers restore media as a
$19 option.  OTOH, I just bought a Dell Latitude (commercial-grade
line) that came with a Windows 7 install disk that's happily worked on
the new hard drive installed *and* inside Virtual Box under Ubuntu.  I
suspect the slim margins on the consumer side of the business force
all sorts of gambles.  Given the effect on margins of fielding phone
calls, gambles is what they are.

BTW, I bought my Latitude from outlet.dell.com after that option was
suggested on this list.  Thanks!

Subject: [PLUG] Hardware Problem -- Kernel panic and reset
Message-ID: <4B80D80B.4050905@wescottdesign.com>

This is _not_ really a Linux issue, because we're seeing basically the 
same behavior under both Linux and Windows.

The computer is a built-box, with an Azus P5NSLI motherboard, somewhere 
between one to three years old.  Any time it gets left on too long it 
resets.  Working on it tonight, I noticed that if you're in Linux when 
this happens you get the two blinking keyboard lights which (I think, at 
least) indicates a kernel panic; they stay on for about ten seconds 
before the thing reboots.

It seems to be a heat problem -- the problem takes a long time to happen 
from a cold start, but will happen often when you're using the box hard, 
shut down for a bit and it'll take a bit longer to happen the first 
time, etc.

What I _don't_ know, since I purposely stopped being current with PC 
maintenance about ten years ago, is (a) if there's anything I can do to 
verify this other than by swapping parts (the fans do all run -- I know 
that), (b) if this could be anything other than the motherboard or 
memory (i.e. is there any chance this is the power supply?), and (c) 
what I might do to isolate the problem without having to run out and buy 
a bunch of parts.

Clearly if I want to start swapping parts I can just go by a nifty new 
motherboard, which will force me to buy a nifty new processor and nifty 
new memory -- I want to avoid that if I can, particularly if that'll 
just lead me to finding out that the power supply is intermittent.

Subject: [PLUG] Keyboard problem
Message-ID: <20100221065522.GA3084@gate.kl-ic.com>

My wife's Thinkpad T30 starting acting up - the E key stopped working,
and then it went into permanent enter key repeat mode.  "Fix it NOW",
she soothingly whispered.

So, I pulled the keyboard, did the keyboard tape trick, a distilled
water rinse, lintless towelling, and air dry.  I put the keyboard 
back, and put her laptop back into the docking cradle.  Same thing.

I swapped the keyboard with that of another T30.  Rebooted.  Same
thing.  Her keyboard worked on the other T30.   Not the keyboard.

I restarted and went into the BIOS - that worked, and the enter key
worked.  Later in the linux boot process, the repeats began.  My
goodness, could this be damaged software?

I pulled her T30 from the docking cradle - and the repeats stopped(!)

Checking the docking cradle, I found a expected USB cable to a USB
hub, which connects to her mouse and USB dictation headset.  The
cable appeared to loop under a stack of papers and books. 

Underneath the stack was the USB numeric extension pad she borrowed
to enter numbers for taxes, then forgot about.  The stack was resting
on the enter key.

I'm keeping the cleaned T30 keyboard.  She can clean the other one
if she wants.  And I'm hiding the numeric extension pad.  Fooey.

Lesson:  Always follow the wires.  You never know what you will find
on the other end.

Boot and run memtest and alternatively grab a bench marking tool for
either OS that will thrash the heck out of the CPU/Fans etc and see if
you can get it to barf. Should help narrow it down.

Have you tried opening up your computer and blowing all the dust out 
using canned air for electronics? If the fans are working correctly, 
then dust buildup can prevent the fans from cooling off the 
heat-producing parts of your computer (mainly the CPU and Hard Disk(s)) 
and can cause safeguards built into your system to trip and turn your 
system off in order to prevent heat-related hardware damage.

I used to be able ...Now I can't...

I have tried three different browsers...

I have company over, every once and again, they have email at comcast.net

Step 1: check your /etc/resolv.conf file, and make sure it is pointing to
the correct nameservers.

Do you have a static IP, or are you set up with the usual DHCP
configuration? Maybe simply releasing and renewing your DHCP lease would fix
it, since DHCP reqrites resolv.conf.

I can ping comcast.net (from Pocatello, Idaho, connected via CableOne).

My first steps would be to ping it, traceroute it, then to do a dig +trace.

You're correct in that it could also be something local, a firewall, etc.

The hypothesis is reasonable. To verify - 

What does your /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THM/temperature file say? Can you
script it to track the temp of your system?

Thanks,

Thanks to everyone who answered...

I can ping both .com and .net

I can traceroute both .com and  .net
On traceroute  the last 4/5 hops are ***... Which is probably  OK???

I am not running  any firewall..  Unless for some reason Firefox
generated one of its own...

/etc/resolv.conf  is just fine..Everything else works...   Just .net
won't come up in a browser...  And


This is the error I get with FIrefox.

#################



Failed to Connect








Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at www.comcast.net.




Though the site seems valid, the browser was unable to establish a connection.





#####################


Big surprise  Opera did load comcast.net..

I can't verify email...But, that looks good


Seamonkey results below

##############

Failed to Connect



The connection was refused when attempting to contact www.comcast.net.




Though the site seems valid, the browser was unable to establish a connection.


##############


I am still very confused..


If anyone wants to see  ping  or traceroute I can post...


Thanks for the help so far..

Marvin

Set Firefox's cache size to 0. Maybe the page was down for a bit, and
Firefox cached this fact. Also, do you have a web proxy, such as squid?
Though the fact that other browsers can reach the same page sorta isn't
consistent with squid being the problem.

Maybe go to about:config in Firefox and look for anything fishy.

And there's always wireshark. It will tell you if a request is even being
made, and if so, what the response is. If a request isn't even going out,
then Firefox is giving you a cached page.

Ever take the CPU fan off and clean the heat sink? I have some machines 
in industrial control environments that I clean every spring before the 
hot weather hits.

Thanks for the feedback...

Check about:config..    Didn't see anything..

I have no proxy  or squid...

I could do wireshark...Haven't used it for a bit so would have to fish a lot

All browser bring up comcast.com...  is comcast.net someone different
or same company??


Thanks

Marvin

Thanks all -- some of this was stuff I already planned to do, some of it 
was stuff (like blowing off the heat sink fins) that hadn't occurred to 
me, all if it is helping me organize my line of attack.

A few others you could try that I didn't see mentioned are:

1. Try connecting to comcast.net w. a text based browswer like lynx.
2. Try connectng to comcast.net w. a "buit-in" browser like konqueror or 
epiphany. For instance, when I tried Konqueror, I got a message that 
only certtain vers of browsers were supported like IE7, IE8, Ffox3, 
Safari and not Konqueror. Just some more info that might be helpful...
2. Get the ip addr and put that in the URL locater bar instead of the 
text based URL.
3. Clear your browser and dns cache.
4. Telnet to www.comcast.net on port 80: "telnet www.comcast.net 80"
5. I stopped using Firefox plugins because it seemed I was getting mixed 
results w. page load times and site functionality.

Same company, different purposes.  Comcast.com is the site where you do 
business with Comcast, i.e. find services, pay your bill, etc.  
Comcast.net is the Comcast service provider where the email service, web 
pages, portal and other goodies are provided to internet customers.

My money is on a faulty cached page in firefox.  Go to Tools->Clear 
History from the menus and clear the cache.  Make sure you clear the 
active logins and cookies also.

Did you try www.comcast.net? It could be some kind of domain guessing
problem that the other  browsers don't use see:

Subject: [PLUG] Streaming audio with ices and icecast2...
Message-ID: <1266802916.6495.8.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

My ices-alsa.xml file that is supposed to configure capture of audio
from line in on my SB AWE 64 ISA sound card is attached.

One thing I'm confused about are the authentication directives.

Another area of trouble is that I'm trying to run ices and icecast
via a non root user.  This works for icecast but it doesn't work for
ices when I want to use the attached xml file.

Subject: [PLUG] CentOS 5 and TARPIT module
Message-ID: <4B82B16D.4090105@cyber-office.net>

I'm trying to get the iptables TARPIT module working on some CentOS 5.x 
systems.

The hitch seems to be the kernel module is not there.  TARPIT is suppose 
to be available via. xtables-addons but when I try to build that package 
(./confiugre) I get the error:

"No package 'xtables' found"

The INSTALL specifies in Extra Notes:

   * requires that no vendor backports interfere

Has anyone got TARPIT working with CentOS 5.x?  Any suggestions as to 
how to proceed?


TIA,
Rod

Subject: [PLUG] Erasing tapes
Message-ID: <4B82BD9B.7030709@gmail.com>

I have a bunch of DLT tapes I want to erase and give to freegeek.  I 
don't have a degausser, nor do I really want to invest in one.

I wrote this script in an attempt to do a fairly decent job of erasing 
the tapes.

I realize that with enough forensic work there is data that's 
recoverable, however since I'm not a secret gov't agency I doubt anyone 
really cares.

I'm looking for feedback on this script, things that might make it "better".

#/bin/sh

MT=`which mt`
DD=`which dd`
DEVICE="/dev/st0"
$MT -f $DEVICE rewind
$MT -f $DEVICE erase
$DD if=/dev/urandom of=$DEVICE bs=2048K
$MT -f $DEVICE compression off
$DD if=/dev/zero of=$DEVICE bs=2048K
$MT -f $DEVICE erase
$MT -f $DEVICE eject

Note: The compression off statement was needed, otherwise the server 
just went along compressing zero's and writing something to tape about 
every hour.....

You could wrap an extension cord
around them and power up something you'd normally have powered up.? That
will create an electromagnetic field to foul them into unreadability.?


Off the top of his head Keith probably knows how much current
you'd have to run through how many loops of cord to do the job.? 

It's easy to test if it works.

I can't test this, but wouldn't wipe do the job? I would think something 
along the lines of

wipe -Da /dev/st0

would work, although it could take a long time (35 passes by default, 
use -q to do four passes). In the same time and with less mechanical 
wear and tear you could sit a few rare earth magnets on the cartridge.

There's also the GNU shred utility. I'm not sure how similar it is to 
wipe, but it's intended for securely erasing files off of disk drives by 
writing passes of random data onto it. It can be run on device files, too.

Before worrying too much about this, find out what Free Geek would
do with the tapes.  I brought them about 50 pounds of QIC tapes
a few weeks ago.  I got the impression they were going to take off
the aluminum bottom plates to recycle, and scrap the rest.  

DLT tapes don't have much worth recycling, IIRC.  

A bulk tape demagnetizer is a handy tool to have around, when you
have magnetic media.  I bought one at Radio Shack decades ago. 
Essentially a transformer with zillions of turns of thin wire
around a core with one side removed.  I use mine in a room 20
feet from the nearest media - a one foot gap is perfectly safe,
but things tend to get set down in the wrong places around here.
The extension cord idea won't work - the current going up one
wire cancels out the current going down the other.  You need lots
of turns to make a big field, and a magnetic core to concentrate
the magnetic field where you want it.

A shredder might be easier than a demagnetizer, but the tape might
get wound around the grinding cylinders.  If the ventilation is
good in your kitchen, you could microwave a cartridge, which would
melt the tape layers together.  Guaranteed unreadable after that. 
I microwave CDs to destroy them, often doing a whole stack at once,
with a cup of water for "ballast".  I run the fans for an hour
afterwards, to get rid of the smell before my wife gets home. :-)

Wouldn't it be a lot
better to just smash them with a hammer?? 
No need to consume
electricity to destroy and then flush the (toxic?) 
vaporized media from
your living space.

I looked in to this about a year ago. What I learned is that the
required kernel modules are not in CentOS binary kernels, not in
source for the CentOS kernels, and not in kernel sources from
Linus. You have to apply the "patch-o-matic-ng" patches from the
netfilter/iptables project to whatever kernel sources you want
to use and then build a custom kernel.

Some distributions include the patch-o-matic-ng patches in their
kernels but not RHEL/CentOS.

I have destroyed HDs in my little coal-fired melting furnace.
The drive discs don't melt, but the aluminum, zinc, and pot-metal does,
which I can use for my castings, and the controller boards and wiring end
up toast.

But the steel foundry I worked at had the *best* procedure:

a) Bring over the ladle of, say 9 tons of steel at 3000F, freshly tapped
from the furnace. Wave at the guy on the bridge crane so he can see you and
know where NOT to lower this thing.

b) Toss in the drives: splash, splash, sparky splash. Break the slag and
push the drives under the crust if necessary.

Within the hour, your drives will be permanently 'reformatted' as teeth for
mining equipment, sea chain, anchors for oil platforms, and propeller
struts for large vessels.

Great work if you can still get it,   :-D

Blank screen, or what?  Yes, the blinking lights are kernel panic.

Like everyone else said, it's probably a heat issue, but I would suggest
(a) checking the video card heat sink (if it's separate) and
(b) reseating RAM, PCI and AGP boards, and (if not too scary) the CPU.
(c) Running memtest and CPUburn.

Quick note - when I was helping out there a couple years ago, they had a
degausser and used it diligently on tapes.  But your /dev/urandom and

What capacity tapes, BTW?

I volunteered at Free Geek for a while a few years back - for the drives 
to be kept & re-used, a software wipe was performed.  For those to be 
recycled, a "sledge hammer re-format" was applied.  About a 5 lb hammer 
liberally applied to the hdd rendered it pretty much secure.  This works 
well for those of us who don't have melting furnaces in the basement.

Ah, data destruction competition, eh?

Load the media into a fast rocket, and launch them towards Jupiter. 
With the right gravity-assist trajectory, you can drop them directly
into the sun.  The atomic nuclei will still survive, though.  Risky.

For higher security, you may wish to expend vast amounts of energy
in particle accelerators, creating an equivalent mass of antimatter. 
Bring the media and antimatter together, preferably behind an outer
planet, where the emitted gamma rays and pions will not reveal any
of your data.

Be sure to sweep the region for interstellar alien snoopers.  If
you find any, repeat the process above.  You can't be too careful.

If all else fails, dropping the solar system into a black hole is
sure to maximize the entropy of your stored data.  Perhaps quasars
are the work of aliens who are really concerned about data security.

:-)

I have a need to implement a new server/application.  It needs to have
a web interface and the ability to have multiple forums.
Also E-mail interface and search capability.

We currently run on RHEL5 so that could be an issue with something too
out there.

I would like the plug's community option of what they would use.

Depending on how much of a social network experience you are after,
you might want to check out buddypress (buddypress.org/) which
implements forums and a host of other social features (user profiles,
groups, activity stream) on top of wordpress.  There are a growing
number of plugins for it that might fit the features you need (and
most standard wordpress plugins work as well).  It also incorporates
bbpress, though the amount of actively maintained plugins for that
keep lowering and lowering.

I like bbPHP, nice simple interface, full forum features, easy to 
install but requires a backend DB.
Also look at the forum features of Drupal, there you get the full CMS 
plus the forum.

Everything freezes in place -- no screen blank.  Then the lights start 
blinking and I start cussing.

We've reseated the RAM -- both because we wanted to do the check, and 
because we moved some hard drives around and the memory is physically 
large -- re-gooped the CPU heat sink, and run memtest.  I'll try the 
other things.

At this point I'm thinking it's either a loose connection or a dried out 
cap, because the more I use it the more I note that the problem 
occasionally happens right at startup even when the system is cold.

I suspect that it's time for a new motherboard and/or processor -- I 
just wish I had a way to tell which one without buying lots of parts to 
swap.  A Freegeek used processor may be in this system's near future, 
though.

Not a bad idea.  No capacitors with the top domed out, then?

   I had a problem with a former system and was able to borrow a compatible
CPU from someone on this mail list. Swapping CPUs revealed the problem to be
the motherboard.

   Can you borrow a CPU for testing?

No -- all the caps look just peachy keen.

The computer in question has spend serious time at elevated 
temperatures, so dried out caps is certainly a possibility.  I suppose 
at this point I could just swap them on general principals and see, 
given that what we have now isn't useful for much.

I didn't read the whole thread, but have you installed lm-sensors or
something to monitor the cpu temperature. Some bioses have a
temperature monitoring area also so you could just boot into the bios
and watch the CPU temperature, fan speeds etc.

I need a new computer....

I am on a very limited budget...

My current computer is AMD +1800  .. ..The CPU goes to 100% when I use
a browser..

I am running Ubuntu  8-10 Intrepid....

Suggestions for Cheap upgrade???  Something that will last another 4
or 5 years??

Have you checked freegeek? They have some for sale, but for a few hours

At the risk of offending all of the Ubuntu lovers on PLUG, I've never liked
the poor resource utilization of Ubuntu. I prefer to run Debian, 
specifically
Sidux, which is distro based on Debian Sid.

There are also other distros to consider that are geared towards a small 
footprint and efficient
resource utilization such as Puppy, damn small linux, or even FreeBSD, 
etc...

Also, I noticed that the Google Chrome browser uses mem/cpu resources 
more efficiently than
Firefox. There's 2 other *lightweight* graphical browsers I've heard 
good things about but
never used that you might want to check out: Dillo and Arora.

Just some options to buy you some time and make using your current 
computer a lil'
more tolerable...

I would recommend an OS upgrade.  Intrepid was not the best with system
resources.  I am running a beta of Lucid Lynx (Kubuntu 10.04) on a dell mini
9 with an atom processor and firefox is only using 3% of my CPU.  This
netbook is MUCH lower power than your system so perhaps the software upgrade
is the best way to go.

Subject: [PLUG] Client sending X windows to another through FW
Message-ID: <4B84FFEB.8000600@emediatedesigns.com>

All,

I have this new project I'm working on that requires me to remotely 
access my linux clients from behind a firewall.  The linux clients will 
be running an application at a certain time and would be best if I could 
monitor and alter their configuration remotely at any given time.  I 
remember there being a way for me to send an x window remotely from 
within a firewall to an outside world but thought to ask here if there 
is any new forms of accomplishing my goals so here are the details.

-Client at a remote location behind a firewall, it is able to access the 
internet and upload and connect to different services. The firewall here 
should not be altered.
-Server at another location that is configurable and behind another 
firewall but that firewall can be altered.

I'd hope to have the client start a ssh connection to the server on a 
designated port(that the server is listening too) and then send either 
an xterm, x-application, or perhaps the entire desktop of the remote 
client.  The server user could then configure and alter any UI settings 
and make dynamic changes to any running applications.

This is for all legal reasons and all people involve are completely 
supportive of the idea.  I need an X window because the applications 
being used will have slider controls that may need changing.

If you have any ideas or suggestions that would make this project easier 
or reasons why it will not work I'd appreciate any feedback.  I'm going 
off to test some theories but perhaps someone here will save me from 
having lots of headaches as I develop a solution.

Thanks,

Josh

Marvin,

   Toshibas have worked well for me and can be purchased for less money than
the venerable Lenovo/IBM ThinkPads. Check the large retailers (like BestBuy)
for sales.

Hi Josh,

Here's a link to the remote X-Apps mini howto.

  http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-mini/Remote-X-Apps.html

It occurs to me that you may, either now or in the future, wish to
connect to several different computers behind the firewall by name. For
example, you may, from your local client (technically termed the
'server' in X protocol parlance), wish to connect to X applications on
both server1.remotehost.com and server2.remotehost.com.

To actually reach the remote box behind the remote firewall (if not
using NAT beyond the initial connection or you wish to connect to more
than one remote machine) you need to use SSH tunneling. Basic
introduction here:

  http://www.revsys.com/writings/quicktips/ssh-tunnel.html

One could also set up a permanent Virtual Private Network connection for
this purpose. Now, if you ran SSH through OpenVPN you would experience
performance problems. Still, if you ran, unencrypted, "plain Jane"
remote X sessions through the VPN connection this might really do the trick.

I write, "might" as I do not know your specific bandwidth resources.

The VPN/X route gives you the ability to do more than just remote X
connections--the VPN essentially "joins" your local X server into the
network of the remote network. See the diagram under the 'Road Warrior'
section here:

  http://www.shorewall.net/OPENVPN.html

The above assumes you do not wish to open a separate port on the
firewall for each remote machine. I for security reasons this should be so.

In summary, compressed SSH sessions are what you want for individual
connections to the remote machine. SSH tunneling will provide you with
multiple remote computer connections. If it seems reasonable that you
will expand the services between these two networks, consider
unencrypted X sessions over a Virtual Private Network.



Very Best,


-Coop

Your computer sounds plenty fast.  Is your disk light on a lot?  How much
RAM do you have?  RAM (at FreeGeek) is waaay cheaper than a new computer.

Are there lots of browser windows open, with Flash playing?  If you're
running Firefox or Chromium, you might try installing FlashBlocker.

I have to agree.  If you're really looking to save money, scale back
those things hogging resources on your box.  This doesn't necessarily
require switching distributions. (I can't comment on upgrading to later
Ubuntu versions, though you should consider that.)  Switch to a less
resource-intensive window manager (i.e. not Gnome or KDE based) and
try out a few different browsers.  Adding RAM is always a convenient
hack to add life to an aging box and it seems nowadays most software
on Linux is chewing through RAM like it's going out of style, so you
probably need it.

Mozilla's browsers always seem to go through cycles of becoming really
lean and fast and then slowly creeping into utter dog-slowness with
poorly designed new features, only to be reborn again in a later
trimmed down version.  Maybe try a later release of that and see if it
helps. 

I have to say I've been interested in Chrome as well, though I haven't
tried it on Linux yet.  I think those developers are going in the
right direction with Linux integration though, so it's promising.
Opera has also always been quite fast, though I'm not sure how much of
a resource hog it is generally.  Opera recently switched to using apt
for updates on Debian-based systems (it optionally adds a line to your
/etc/apt/sources.list), so that should be really convenient for you as
an Ubuntu user.

HTH,
tim

   This is why we run xubuntu on my wife's lower-end machines. Also, it turns
out that seamonkey is more gentle using available resources than are the
separate firefox and thunderchicken. While Xfce is bloating one does not
need to install or use the plethora of toolettes.

   That is, if the particular type of RAM one needs is still available.
Machines don't need to be too old nowadays to find no one's making the RAM
it requires.

It's true, it is getting harder.  And if you do find it, it's often
quite expensive.  When I remember to, I try to max out my systems' RAM
a couple of years after buying/building them, since that seems to be
the sweet spot for availability and cost.

I hate to disagree, but I did some experiments a couple years ago, and
found that Firefox dominated RAM usage, no matter the desktop environment,
WM, tuning or other things.  Everything else was not that significant.

In engineering terms, Firefox >> Desktop.

In my experience, Chromium uses as much or more RAM than Firefox.

I haven't compared recent WebKit, Konq or Opera browsers.  I should
stabilize an document my testing methodology and run some comparisons.

BTW - if you have > 256MB RAM and a recent Ubuntu, consider allocating
some RAM for Compcache in /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf

   Before the Toshiba Tecra gave up I considered buying more RAM for it. To

   Interesting, Aaron. I've been running some resource-intensive spatial
models recently and while watching 'top' see that firefox-bin usually wants
less than 5% of the available (2G) RAM. It's about the same now without
these number crunching processes running.

Ah, I don't doubt that, I guess my suggestion was more focused on
freeing up resources so Firefox could eat them more freely. =)  Thanks
for summary of your testing with other browsers.

If you just love Ubuntu to pieces, going from Ubuntu to Xbuntu will make

I have found much the same thing.  Most all of my RAM goes to a few
piggy applications like VMWare, OpenOffice, gimp, and firefox.  Some
of these like VMWare and gimp are serious applications doing serious
work on major data sets; so I can understand their large RAM
requirements - BUT firefox!!  It is just a pig.  (But I like pigs, so
I continue to use it.)  What is worse it's memory requirements seem to
increase with time.  I find I have to shut firefox down every few days
and restart it to recover memory.  Sure glad I don't need to do this
VMWare.

Arora is worth a look.  It began as a Qt4 WebKit demo app, and has
since become a Real Browser.  It's significantly faster than Firefox,
especially on my vintage Powerbook G4.  I still wouldn't call it fast,
though.

    Yes, this is a very salient point to consider when using Ffox. I 
tend to have at least 2 instances
    of any browser running w. 15-20 tabs open per each

    Also, one of the really neat features of Chrome is that it tracks 
mem, cpu, and netwwork by each
    web session, plugin, and extension. So, if a particular web site or 
plugin/extension is hogging up
    all your resources you can finger it and kill it. For example, the 
shockwave flash plugin is tying up
    125 MB or mem right now on my machine.

    You can find this 'Task Manager' under "Dev Tools' or just hit 
"Shift+Esc" while the Chrome browser window is       
    active.

   Some of you must know The GIMP well and I hope you have a quick answer for
me.

   I'm trying to draw lines on a layer. According to my copy of Akkana Peck's
GIMP book, to get a straight line, click at one point, move to the next
point and press the shift key, when satisfied with the second end point,
click the left button again.

   When I do this, I see the dotted line with the shift key held down, but no
line is drawn when I click the button the second time. Brush size is not
affecting the results.

   Has anyone insight into what I'm doing incorrectly with GIMP-2.4.7 here?

TIA,

Rich

I'm no graphics designer, so when I do muck around with the GIMP, I
often run into gotchas like this.

Are you sure you're not editing the wrong layer?  It may be writing to
some background layer while you've got another layer hiding changes on
top.  What about selections?  Sometimes, when you're trying to draw
things, it'll only take effect within the selected area and if you're
outside of it, there'll be no change.

Tim,

   I use it so infrequently I'm always tripping over something.

   Yes. I'm working on the annotation layer.

   Nothing's selected.

   I'm having other issues with the selection tool. I select some text that I
want to edit, but when I press the text button I get a new window rather
than the existing one.

   This whole exercise is taking much more time than it should and is quite
the PITA. Sigh.

Do you keep the shift held down until after the second click?
Double check:
    The layer you're working on is currently visible
        and not hidden by a higher layer
    You've selected ALL or NONE or the area you're trying to draw in.


Re: the other thing you mentioned about text.  AFAIK once you anchor text it ceases 
to be editable text and becomes a graphic entity.  So if you want to correct spelling
you'll need to redo the text.

   Sonofagun! That was the issue: I had slected a layer but not 'all' so
there was no area in which to draw.

Is it true that the ReactOS community has made a number of requests for
functionality additions to GCC that only make sense in a Windows
environment?  Is it true that the GCC developers say no a lot to the
ReactOS developers?  Considering that talking about using an open source
compiler and open source tools to build ReactOS got me locked out of the
ReactOS forums, I will not be surprised if I find that there is little
to no respect for the ReactOS community in the GCC community.

What do people here think of the ReactOS community comment that GCC is a
Linux only compiler?  I think that is ludicrous.  Hurd and Syllable come
to mind.

Thanks that helps a lot.  I will have many clients behind potential 
firewalls that I'll want to log into One remote server which a person 
could then work from and alter all the clients configurations as needed. 
  It has occurred to me that if I just ssh to a remote computer and not 
do X Forwarding that any X windows will be displayed on the remote and 
not local machine provided that xhost is allowed on the remote server.

But I could possible use VPN to make a network connection and then just 
do a normal login from the server to each client as they would then be 
on my VPN and could authenticate as a normal network computer.  I'm a 
bit concerned about performance and network bandwidth but I could play 
with it and figure it out.

Thanks for the the suggestions.

Apparently, asking that ReactOS be built using open source compilers and
open source tools is unacceptable behavior.  I don't buy the ReactOS
community argument that GCC is a Linux only compiler.  A first for me,
I got accused of being against the poor advocating the use of open
source build tools.

I no longer link to the ReactOS web site from my links page as I no
longer wish to recommend the project to people.  People are better off
throwing Windows out and switching to Linux, even if these people are
responsible for a company and software has to be ported.  With vendors
starting to release information for the writing of Linux drivers and
in some cases providing closed source drivers, the argument that one
needs Windows seems to be getting close to moot.

to the scroll bar even when I release the left mouse button. Basically, it

Any ideas?

It's worth noting that this switch doesn't require a new OS install,
just aptitude install xubuntu-desktop (or something like that -- it
may be renamed now) and log out / reboot and log back in with xfce
instead of gnome.

Be aware that there is quite a lot of overlap between the xfce and
gnome variants of ubuntu.  Many of the background services that
xfce-session kicks up are just bits of gnome. (eg: gnome-power-manager
and gnome-settings-daemon, for starters).  This probably isn't
particularly important for the OP's performance issues, but if you're
troubleshooting issues in gnome, then switching to xfce will only
change some of the variables.  (which may be good or bad, depending on
the circumstances -- but it's good to know.)

Subject: [PLUG] Switching keyboard layouts via script
Message-ID: <e64656921002250849n7683d796u333743d9aa2c869a@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I'm trying to resolve a problem with my keyboard layout options on
Ubuntu 9.10.

The problem is that when I'm at my desk, I plug in an aluminum Mac
keyboard.  I prefer to use the Command key as an Alt key because the
placement is the same as on my PC-layout keyboard.

However, this requires that I access the Keyboard GUI menus and do a
bunch of clicking every time I plug this keyboard in.

So, I wrote a script to swap the keys for me.  I've had limited
success -- none of the CLI commands seem to work right.

First I tried gconftool.  Nothing I set here applied to my session,
though, for some reason.

Next I tried setxkbmap.  This worked temporarily - however, Gnome's
keyboard settings were always set, I guess in gconf, and would
eventually override my changes (during a login session).

Finally I tried writing out two .Xmodmap files and swapping between
them depending on the keyboard, but this has proven unreliable.

Annnyway, does anyone have some wisdom on the best way to change my
layout settings with a script?  Note that I'm not trying to change
layouts -- Gnome doesn't seem to store settings like Alt and Caps key
swapping on a per layout basis.

Andrew

Andrew,

   I've always liked the ctrl key to be at the left end of the home key line
since 1) that's where it was way back when microcomputer keyboards first
came out and b) I use that much more frequently than I do the capslock key.
(The latter is good only for the name of a character in John Sandford
novels: Del Capslock.)

   So, ... at the end of ~/.bash_profile I have:

loadkeys ~/.keymap

and ~/.keymap contains:

# Created 12 July 2002 by Rich Shepard
#
# Exchange the left Control key and the Caps Lock key on the keyboard
keymaps 0-2,4-6,8-9,12
keycode 58 = Control
keycode 29 = Caps_Lock

   This works well for console mode. Then, when I'm working in X, in
~/.xinitrc is the line:

$HOME/.Xmodmap && xmodmap $HOME/.Xmodmap

where .Xmodmap contains:

clear mod4
!
! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L
!
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Control = Control_L
keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Control_L
keysym Alt_L = Meta_L Alt_L

   Both the above have worked well for me for years, regardless of keyboard
used. Currently, my keyboard is a mini (same size as on my notebook) from
Fry's for $15. Takes little room and is highly efficient.

HTH,

Rich

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1002251513110.10130@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   A couple of weeks ago I changed my locale from C to en_US.UTF-8. This
allows me to see European-language accents in alpine, but it's screwed up my
regular text editor (used to compose messages, too), 'joe.' Somehow, now
there's a 'X' after each period in messages apparently written with Outlook
when they are quoted in a reply. I'll deal with that issue shortly.

   The other interesting and unintended side effect is that my spreadsheet
application, XessSE, no longer responds to a file open command. Yes, there
are alternatives, particularly OO.o, but I bought a couple of licenses for
XessSE a dozen years ago and it's perfect for my needs. The issue is locale
related.

   I spent time on the phone this afternoon with the company president (he's
one of the two original developers) and he identified the problem. While
they've moved their enterprise version, Xess, to version 6, the SE remains
frozen at version 5. Version 6 allows the use of most locales, even multiple
ones at the same time. They never added this capability to the SE version 5.
One suggestion he had was to wrap the command to invoke the application so
that it perceives the LANG to be 'C' rather than en_US.UTF-8.

   Can someone point me toward a way of writing such a wrapper script? I'm
not sure what search term(s) to use in Google to see if a solution can be
found there.

Rich,
Maybe something like

#!/bin/bash
LOCALE=C
export LOCALE
<path to my program> &
unset LOCALE
source <whatever file you set LOCALE in>

dunno if that's what you're looking for or whether or not it's even optimal.

I think it's as simple as defining LC_ALL right on the command line:

  LC_ALL=C <executable_name>

I do this all the time:

  LC_ALL=en_US.utf8 gimp

to get gimp in English instead of German (which is my default locale).

Can you edit the command that the panel icon invokes?

if so, you can put LOCALE=C in front of it, or LC_ALL or whatever variable
you want to set for the duration of that process' existence.

Yes it is up to date. I found out some more information about this problem
as follows:

After looking around a number of forums I found out that there is a piece of
pointer/touchpad hardware commonly found in laptops by ALSA. Because of
certain hardware code coming out of it, it is not too compatible with Fedora
thus far. This is known about, and there are plans to have it fixed for
kernel subversion 33. We are now working with subversion 31.

I have found that sticking to the touchpad and its buttons renders the
behavior pretty OK. Start playing with the pointer and all hell breaks
loose.

don't seem to be having any problems with the mouse.

So it looks like (for me) it is only when I use the touch pad or pointer,
but the USB mouse is okay.

Thanks, I look forward to the fix with kernel subversion 33. Mike

Drew,

   Interesting. Does unsetting LOCALE restore the original version?

   Ah! This sets the environment for only that application, then. Good to
know. I'll try this and Drew's suggestion and see if either or both work.

Thanks,

   It does not like that; reports it cannot run 'LC_ALL=C'. I'll try the bash

Subject: [PLUG] C question...
Message-ID: <1267233565.6815.2.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to write a simple C program to open a text file with
temperature data in it, extract the highest, the lowest, and the
last temperature, and write that information to another text file.

How in C do I verify that the files I'm working with are text files?
Specifically since I don't allow clobbering, I'm worried about the 
input file.

I'm thinking there is a UNIX file command which I should be able 
to call from inside the C program, but is there a better way?

Subject: [PLUG] C++ include files and autocompletion in IDEs
Message-ID: <4B88841B.2040500@pippiandcarlos.com>

There seems to be an issue with certain C++ IDEs (Eclipse and Emacs with
XRefactory) in dealing with symbols defined in included header files. Not
custom headers like "MyHeader.hpp"; rather system headers like <string> or
<iostream>.

For instance, if I type this much code into one of the aforementioned editors:

  string foo = "hello world";
  cout << foo.

I would like to be able to get a list of completions for the string class,
like length(), at(), etc. But I get nothing.

I looked at string.h and found a possible reason why. This file contains
nothing except more #include directives. length(), at() and the other
methods are defined in other header files. All the C++ header files are like
this.

Is there a nice Linux C++ IDE that overcomes this limitation?

Make sure that all the characters in the file are printable text + CR and LF.

You are better off using a script.  Bash, perl, awk etc.

This sounds about the level of a first assignment in a C class. ;-)

I don't think there is a simple way to do what you want to do in C,
generally.  The *nix command line utility 'file' goes through an extended
series of tests to determine file type, incuding as a last resort (as Bill
mentioned) actually examining the file in an attempt to determine the
character set (not all 'text' character sets are the same).  If the data in
the file is in some regular format, you could approximate this by doing a
pre-examination of the file before you use it, to try and determine if the
things you think are there really are there. Alternatively, you could issue
a 'file' command from your code (using popen, for example), and read the
results.

You read a bytestream and see if it matches your expected range of
characters.  if it doesn't match you handle the unexpected input
in whatever manner you deem appropriate for your program and shut
down.

There is such a program, but you're writing something in C.
If you wanted to use such a program you'd be writing a shell script.

Subject: [PLUG] Portland Startup Weekend is happening March 5-7 @ Nedspace
Message-ID: <4B895D9C.8040701@zenlinux.com>

Hi all,

I briefly mentioned this during my PLUG AT presentation a week or so 
ago, and though I'd bring it up on the mailing list.

Portland Startup Weekend is kind of a mix between an unconference and a 
weekend-long development sprint. You show up, pitch project ideas, form 
teams, and work your ass off all weekend and see what comes out of it. 
If the stars align right and your team gels, you may even find yourself 
becoming a co-founder of a new tech startup company.

It's certain to be a lot of fun, and it's only $75 to register (students 
can register for $40). Friday night there will also be some great 
presentations to get things going on the right foot.

For more details, visit http://portland.startupweekend.org

I'm planning to be there, and I'm especially interested in any product 
ideas that would involve an embedded Linux project. I've posted a few 
concepts on the Comment Wall of the Portland Startup Weekend community site:

http://startup-weekend.ning.com/group/portland

It just occurred to me that sensor networks would also be a compelling 
concept to pursue.

Ping me off-list if you'd like to get in touch.

Scott

PS - If this kind of things sounds really interesting to you but you 
feel a paralyzing sense of anxiety/nervousness about it, don't let that 
stop you! You do not need any startup experience to get involved, only a 
willingness to be open-minded and flexible, and to focus on a project 
for a weekend. I have no idea what the heck I'm doing registering for 
this event, but I do know when it's over I will have no regrets.

Hey, Rich,

Thanks for this tip on xmodmap - previously I didn't get as far as
actually using the xmodmap command, only swapping my .Xmodmap files.
Eeeenteresting.

Del Capslock, eh?  Hrm.  I haven't read John Sandford.  Lately my book
spice has been Iain M. Banks.  Spaceships, lasers, aliens - that kind
of stuff.

Also - about the Caps Lock key.  That's like the greatest swapping key
ever.  I swap it with Escape, since I code a lot in Vim.

Andrew

Rich,

Er, I guess I *had* already tried using the xmodmap command (just read
my script).  hrmm.  I'll try experimenting with my map file using your

I finished getting a Linux from scratch system working.

A few things missing, there is no netstat command, no ifconfig command,
and no dns/dhcp commands.

Pulled out my bash book and played a bit with the shell prompt.

I don't know how to set the hostname, so the host name comes up as
(none).

I haven't gotten my wireless logitech keyboard to work with this system,
maybe I need to add something to the kernel?

Well, I'll have to see if I can get the networking tools to fit in 100
megs or less.

Which version of LFS are you using?

The IPRoute2 package provides "ip" tool that replace ifconfig functionality,

The inetutils package provides a "hostname" tool, that is very easy to
set hostname: as "hostname lfs-host"

maybe need some special kernel configuration option, you can always
find out that by learning from other mature Linux distro that can
drive it;

   I get enough of that dealing with regulators, resource agency staff, and
politicians. I don't need to read about it in my down time.

   I'm an emacian so I set my joe and lyx keystrokes to match. :-) As it has
been written, diff'ren (key)strokes for diff'rent folks.

Subject: [PLUG] Fast-Cgi with Wt (C++ web toolkit)
Message-ID: <5a679c1c1002281905m1a5ea17aiddf924038e4af538@mail.gmail.com>

Is anyone using Wt?  Does it work?  Is it mature?

Wt is a toolkit for creating web applications.  Developers write C++
code, and  Cascading Style Sheets, and nothing else.  Wt then
generates  the necessary HTML/XHTML, Javascript, CGI, SVG/VML/Canvas
and AJAX code.
The application is deployed as a Fast-Cgi executable along with
associated resource files.

Can anyone recommend a web hosting company that supports Fast-Cgi protocal?

Thanks,
Bill
