In a perfect world, PLUG presentations would be both streamed and 
captured. I dabbled with the once using Vimeo and at Roots and there was 
a question from I believe... South Africa. PLUG also has a non-trivial 
number of list members who are not in the Portland area.

I also noticed that there was a PLUG podcast feed.

Is streaming/recording presentations something I should pursue?

What happens at PLUG stays at PLUG? :)

On that note...

Out speaker this week would prefer use a latest 'n' greatest laptop with 
HDMI output. The venue has VGA.

Being a digital to analog conversion, this is non-trivial. See the dozen 
or so $8 cables on Amazon with one star. :(

I have seen smart adapters for about $100.

Has anyone used one?

Can anyone bring one?

Thanks!

If I recall correctly, the projector in the room has an HDMI input. The
electronics in the podium are VGA only, but if you have a long enough
HDMI cable you can just stand on a table and plug it directly into the
back of the projector, bypassing the podium.

This will also give you better resolution, as the podium dumbs
everything down to 1024 x 768.

I don't recall the make and model of the projector, but it was discussed
here a couple years ago when I did my presentation on Scribus.

I should have mentioned that the AV office in the basement of Smith has
HDMI to VGA adapters, among other hardware. I have borrowed other
hardware from them in the past. Last time I did so they held my student
ID card hostage until I returned the item.

It's something I hope someone else with the tools will volunteer
to do; you've already got plenty of tasks, while I am backing
towards the nearest exit, away from the risk of commitment...

I wonder - is there any hardware plus web video app combining
slides with the speaker's talking head and blackboard work? 
My web slide presenter, wydiwys, could be hacked to include a 
rectangular insert for a streaming flash video of the speaker.


> What happens at PLUG stays at PLUG? :)

The first rule of PLUG is nobody talks about PLUG.  The second
rule of PLUG is nobody talks about talking about PLUG, making
the propagation of silly rules impossible.  Without rules, if
anyone wants to stream video, they are free to do so, and we
are free to start wearing clothing to meetings.

   In a data file I have rows like this:

where the 4th field is blank. I want to drop these rows from the output.

   The awk script begins like this:

#! /usr/bin/gawk -f

BEGIN { FS = "|"; OFS = "|" }

# If no quantity, drop row
$4 ~ /""/ { next }

   yet these rows are not dropped. My reading of the next statement in
'Effective awk Programming' and in examples Google found for me suggest that
the above syntax should work. Can someone point out what I missed?

   Er, wrong data file. That line should be:

'D-1'|'2007-12-12'|'Hg'||0||

A larger data set and a larger section of the script will be needed
as the script won't print anything as written.

I just looked up the discussion from November, 2010. The projector is a
Hitachi CP-SX1350. The original MSRP was $15,000! Details are here:

http://www.projectorcentral.com/Hitachi-CP-SX1350.htm

After looking at the above page I'm not sure if it has an HDMI input. I
do know that its native resolution (what it projects) is 1400 x 1050,
and it will accept input up to 1600 x 1200. When I connected my laptop
to it directly with a VGA cable xrandr immediately noted that a monitor
at 1400 x 1050 was available.

Larry,

   Here's the script:

#! /usr/bin/gawk -f

BEGIN { FS = "|"; OFS = "|" }

# If no quantity, drop row
$4 ~ /""/ { next; }

# If date prior to 2007, date code = 0
$2 < /"2007-01-01"/ { print $1, $2, 0, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7 }

# If date since 2007, date code = 1

For the empty value replace /""/ with /^$/

When I ran your program I found that it never matched the later dates.
Awk for the most part does everything as strings and your quoted date
fields won't match
first because the quotes don't match the data.
Since everything is based off the year, I use a sub string approach.
Based on your data here is the working script.  If you need something
more flexible
then you might want to convert the date into epoch time with a
function and then do
the comparison in seconds.

#! /usr/bin/gawk -f

BEGIN { FS = "|"; OFS = "|" }

# If no quantity, drop row
$4 ~ /^$/ { next; }

# everything else is valid, decode for date
{
# If date prior to 2007, date code = 0
 if (substr($2,2,5) < 2007) { print $1, $2, 0, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7 }

# If date since 2007, date code = 1
if (substr($2,2,5) > 2006) { print $1, $2, 1, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7 }
}

Larry,

   I was not aware that I could use BOL/EOL within a field delimiter. Didn't

I found this in my inbox today:

UEFI and Secure Boot
No Free Boots

The imminent Windows 8 implementation of UEFI with Secure Boot adds an 
extra layer of complexity for some Linux users. We look at the problem 
and two solutions from Fedora and Canonical.

... I was talking to Jordan Hubbard the early FreeBSD guy who is now 
deeply involved with Apple's Mac OS X, about the new era of "locked 
down" OS's like Apple's iOS. His simple response was, paraphrased: 
"People asked us to get rid of viruses and malware."

With the release of their hermetically-sealed "retina" MacBook with zero 
user-serviceable parts, I suspect the answer is, "peopled wanted it as 
thin and light as possible."

In short, logical conclusions.

Sadly, the conversation has not been, "people want as safe, secure, 
thin, light and OPEN as possible." Fortunately, these goals are not 
mutually-exclusive but they are hard to achieve in the current market.

Other thoughts:

1. http://www.coreboot.org/Welcome_to_coreboot

2. Vendors simply want to know how many units you want before they will 
adjust to your needs. We actually have Apple and the down economy to 
thank for kicking the PC market in the head and forcing it to consider 
new markets within the current ones. Go ask your vendors about open 
source drivers. Go vote with your wallet.

The FSF has written an uncompromising white paper on this topic. PJ
has highlighted and reproduced it at Groklaw:

http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2012070213044413 .

It is also, of course, available at the FSF in both HTML and PDF format:

https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/whitepaper-web


and

https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/whitepaper.pdf
.

It's not light reading, but the danger to Linux users seems to be real.

Robert

Subject: [PLUG] Mac OS X for Linux admin -- server
Message-ID: <4FF5027A.2030003@gmail.com>

My Google search foo is lacking today.

I'm taking on the admin of a server running Mac OS X (10.5.8) so need a 
good reference for a fairly well experienced Linux systems admin.

My Linux distributions of choice are CentOS/Scientific Linux/Fedora 
(Redhat-ian stuff) with a little Ubuntu/Debian.

The biggest issue right now is the init system.  How does Mac OS do it. 
  The Redhat based systems use SysV, init.d, etc.  I thought the BSD 
derivatives used an init.d or rc.d  Couldn't figure out how to 
start/stop/reload a service.

Pointers, ideas, or clue-sticks will be appreciated.

Rod,

   Slackware is BSD-based (but accommodates SVR4, too). I don't know the Mac
partition/directory structure, but in Slackware you'll find service scripts
in /etc/rc.d/; each service has its own script which is called to start,
stop, or restart it. Examples from here:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ ls /etc/rc.d/
init.d/       rc.inet1*                 rc.saslauthd*
rc.0@         rc.inet1.conf             rc.sendmail
rc.4*         rc.inet1.conf.new         rc.serial
rc.6*         rc.inet2*                 rc.snmpd
rc.K*         rc.inetd*                 rc.spamassassin*
rc.M*         rc.ip_forward             rc.spamd*
rc.S*         rc.local*                 rc.sshd*
rc.acpid*     rc.lprng                  rc.syslog*
rc.alsa*      rc.messagebus*            rc.sysstat
rc.apcupsd*   rc.modules@               rc.sysvinit*

Hope this helps,

Rich

Thanks Rich.  I went looking but but found almost nothing that fell into 
that realm.  Of course there were other fires around me so I couldn't 
actually do thorough search on the server.

Was able to do some web looking and found that Apple/Mac OS X Servers 
use a launchctl command and that should help as I was looking how to 
start/stop smbd.
    Interestingly I also found information indicating Apple was moving 
from SAMBA to their own implementation of CIFS/SMB/whatever possibly 
placing it the kernel.

Oh well.

Again thanks,
Rod

See the launchctl(1), launchd.plist(5), and launchd(8) man pages. OS X 
has a concept of daemons that are system-wide and/or per-user.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Meeting Announcement

Who: Auke Kok, Intel Open Source Technology Center
What: The systemd init(8) Replacement
Where: PSU, 1930 SW 4th Ave. Room FAB 86-01 (Lower Level)
When: Thursday, July 5th, 2012 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of awesome, open technologies.

See location H-10 on the PSU map at http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg

It's a little known secret that systemd is extremely capable of
starting, controlling and regulating more than just system services,
but can easily start an entire Desktop UI. Not many people have sat
down and implemented and worked out the problems of starting an X
service, a few UI components, the session bus and DBus services for
normal users with the mechanisms that systemd provides.

The benefits are obvious: Systemd provides excellent service
monitoring and restarting capabilities, provides socket and DBus
activation for relevant services, and overall improves desktop startup
by allowing user services to start well before core services like Xorg
or wayland start. In effect, we're saying goodbye to XDG autostart
entirely, and getting back reliability and scalability.

We converted several desktop environments including Tizen's Mobile UI,
Xfce4, Enlightenment and more to systemd user sessions. We "pop the
hood" and take a look at the implications for startup, what's possible
to further improve on the session startup and where we can do better.


Auke Kok is a software engineer at Intel's Open Source Technology
Center, and has been attempting to make Linux boot faster since 2007.
In 2008, he co-presented the "5-second boot" with Arjan van de Ven at
the first LPC. Since then, Auke has worked on further improving the
Linux Core OS start sequence, first for Moblin and later with MeeGo,
where we made the first switch to systemd. Auke now works on Tizen,
which will heavily integrate systemd in the Core OS.

Thanks Paul.  That explains a couple of things I was reading in some of

Thanks Ron.  Man ... was there a exodus of Microsoft programmers to 
Apple?  That set up makes about as much sense as the Windows Registry. 
Caveat: I'm no Windows expert I just have to deal with a dozen or so 
servers every so often.

The truth, as they say, is stranger than fiction.

It's what happens when an exodus of early Apple/MacOS programmers join
a Mach/BSD startup (NeXT, 1985), and try to make an operating system
based on hybrid OO concepts and Apple ease of use concepts
(NextStep/OpenStep), and then eventually get their work folded back
into the working setup of current Apple products (OS X) starting 11
years (1996) later, with a base product shipping 3 years after that,
which has gradually changed since then.

If you've been an Apple tech for, oh, 20+ years, it totally makes
*some* sense ("Oh, that's where they moved *that* to.") in a perverse
way, as Mac OS 7-9 users got used to "Hold down the shift key to
disable /System/Extensions/, /System/Control Panels/, and /System/,
items from being invoked on startup... ", and other kinds of arcane
things to control something somewhat vaguely similar to runlevels on
boot, based on weird file paths and locations, which *themselves* were
inherited from MacOS 5-6.

launchd is not nearly as opaque as the Windows Registry. It's not 
System-V, true, but it's reasonably well documented and the plist 
files are easily understood.

The launchctl command works in a manner similar to systemctl command 
found on Fedora and other bleeding-edge Linux distributions.

A startup system that can track dependencies and do parallel starts is 
the way Linux heading, so getting a handle on Mac's launchd system 
will get your mindset ready for Linux' future.

you don't need the moderator to do that. in the email the list sends back

I'm pretty sure no one monitors the moderator queue and approves/denies any

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1207060610030.21790@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   There is a domain being rejected by postfix because 'host not found.' I
put that domain name in /etc/postfix/rhsbl_sender_exceptions with an 'OK'.
This has resolved the issue for many other domains, but not this one. A
typical log entry is:

Jul  6 04:42:19 salmo postfix/smtpd[20260]: connect from
mail.hornady.com[69.20.192.122]
Jul  6 04:42:21 salmo postfix/smtpd[20260]: NOQUEUE: reject: RCPT from
mail.hornady.com[69.20.192.122]: 450 4.7.1 <barracuda.hornady.com>: Helo
command rejected: Host not found; from=<> to=<rshepard at twodogs.us>
proto=ESMTP helo=<barracuda.hornady.com>
Jul  6 04:42:21 salmo postfix/smtpd[20260]: disconnect from
mail.hornady.com[69.20.192.122]

   Is this a mal-formed message at the sender's end (notice noting in the
from=<> in the 5th line)?

   Please suggest how I can tweak postfix to receive messages from this
domain.

Thanks,

Rich

I suspect this is due to a "reject_unknown_sender_domain" instruction in the smtpd_recipient_restrictions clause. As long as your whitelist check comes first, you can skip the requirement.

Assuming it fits the facts, maybe try something like:

check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/sender_access

Nathan,

   First is smtpd_client_restrictions which is followed by
check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/rhsbl_sender_exceptions. Second is the
section smtpd_recipient_restrictions which includes
reject_unknown_sender_domain

> Assuming it fits the facts, maybe try something like:
> check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/sender_access

   I have no sender_access file in /etc/postfix, but I do have
rhsbl_sender_exceptions which is the list of white-listed domains. Wonder
what's not working for this one domain.

Thanks,

Rich

$ host barracuda.hornady.com
barracuda.hornady.com does not exist, try again

you can either configure postfix to accept a bogus HELO statement, or add

alternatively, of course, you could suggest to the owner of hornady.com to

Wes,

   I doubt I'll be able to communicate with their IT staff, in both senses of

How about adding "No sunburn from October to June" to the Lifestyle

Not sure if you are looking for proofreading-type feedback, but just in
case...

   - Page 1, left column, 3rd paragraph... I'm guessing that the first word
   should be "Our" (not "Out").

Overall, I think the flyer looks great so far... any other comments I would
have would simply be my personal preferences (and very nitpicky ones, at
that) - the preferences of each of us would surely be different... so, I
choose to let your decisions be authoritative on these matters - since you
are the one that put in the effort to do this in the first place.  :-)

Nice work... and thanks!

1) What's B2B?

2) Narrow columns call for hyphenation

3) PDX also has direct flights to San Diego. And maybe other places. (I
didn't call the airport.)

i had the same initial reaction to "capital" in this context. i checked
Dictionary.com and was surprised at the answer (not how i learned it back
in -ahem- elementary school, lo many decades ago), so remained silent.
Methinks common usage has overtaken my early education. Unfortunately, the

http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/capital
"The noun capital (1)  refers to a city or town that is the seat of
government; to a capital letter as opposed to a lowercase letter; and
to wealth or resources. The noun Capitol  refers primarily to the
building in Washington, D.C., in which Congress sits or to similar
buildings used by state legislatures. "

Not quite, you can easily get access with a library card and a whole
bunch else:

(Your local library system will also have it, if it's not Multnomah

Subject: [PLUG] Intra-networking inconsistent
Message-ID: <4FF8C573.1060301@comcast.net>

I've had a home network for many years. I connect to my wife's Winders 7 
machine using Samba. Sometimes the connection works easily, and other 
times it does not. When she had Winders XP I could make a connection 
from my Ubuntu 10.04 desktop machine to a designated folder on her 
machine (named Transfer), and leave it mounted. If I needed to put 
something there I could drag from wherever on my machine to the icon 
representing that folder on her machine. Something changed when she got 
a new machine with Winders 7. Now, I can connect from my desktop to 
hers, but the icon no longer represents the folder I used to connect to, 
but several layers up. I can leave the connection mounted, but I have to 
open a Nautilus window and drill down to her Transfer folder. That's 
annoying, but I can live with it. I just have to double click on that 
icon to open a Nautilus window and proceed from there.

This morning I opened a connection to her machine, drilled down to her 
Transfer folder, and transferred some files. I left that Nautilus window 
open but minimized and went on with other things. This afternoon I had 
some more things to move to her Transfer folder, so I restored the 
Nautilus window and tried to copy some files. Something happened to the 
connection and the copy stalled. I closed that Nautilus window and tried 
opening a new one. No success. So, I unmounted that connection and 
opened a new one. There was some delay, including a small window that 
told me it was working on it, but then it worked fine.

A separate problem arose this afternoon when I tried to connect to my 
laptop, which is also running Ubuntu 10.04. For reasons I don't 
understand, I can see my desktop machine from my laptop, through Samba, 
but can't see any directories. Likewise, while I could see my laptop 
from my desktop machine via Samba, I could not see any directories on 
the laptop.

Of course, in the process of writing this e-mail I went through the 
steps again. I still can't see my desktop machine from my laptop, but I 
can see my laptop from my desktop machine, and I can get to a shared 
directory.

Can anyone recommend some reading on this subject so I can whack myself 
with a suitable clue stick? (Or, feel free to whack me with said stick 
yourself.)

Thanks.

Possibly helpful suggestion:
Have you tried other protocols, to eliminate SMB as the cause of your issues?

Ranting anger, fueled by too many years of fighting this demon:
SMB is a great protocol for non-switched networks, that were built in
the era of "Ether....net? That sounds scary...." It's not designed for
session recovery, retries, high throughput, large networks, etc. It
was a serial-LAN technology that got ported (begrudgingly) to TCP/IP,
and remains around as part of a standard windows stack, not because it
actually works well, or because it's good, or for any reason other
than Microsoft can use it for lock-in.

If, of course, you'd like some actual link and giggles, try this:
http://developers.slashdot.org/story/00/03/24/0752258/jeremy-allison-answers-samba-questions

It'll help you out with cultural and technical references on the why,

I'm not aware of other protocols to talk to Winders machines. I know 
there is/are other protocols for talking to other Linux machines, but I 
haven't dug into anything other than what Ubuntu includes as standard.

Thanks. I'll give that a read.

I discovered that if I wait 10 minutes or so (maybe only 5 minutes, but 
it seemed like half an hour) one of my machines will eventually see 
another and I'll be able to get what I need done, done. It would have 
been faster to use my USB memory stick as a sneaker net. And, I had the 
same experience trying to get to my wife's old Winders 97 laptop. Once 
the connection is made the file transfers move at a reasonable speed -- 
in other words I didn't notice it being slow.

Exactly, I am using Samba right now, but this thread spurred me on to
look at ssh servers for Windows.
There seem to be a few options  mentioned here
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_servers
even some of the commercial ones like WinSSHD are free for single users.

On the linux side you could use SSHFS to mount the Windows directories.

Anybody use this type of setup?

The aim was for semi-tech-related destinations such as the Bay Area. I

OSCON has again fallen on the Advanced Topics meeting night.

This is not a bad thing.

As the only truly international open source conference on the planet, 
OSCON has more free activities and resources (a.k.a. hallway track) than 
many regional conferences have scheduled.

The Community Leadership Summit is 100% free of charge and allows you to 
talk to key project and community people from around the world:

http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/

 From there the OSCON BOF's, Ignite, Expo Hall, free sessions and 
hallway track are not only free but priceless (as pointed out by Keith):

http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012/public/content/free-expo

If you do want to buy a pass, use the discount code "CFT" to save 20% 
and I will be giving away a pass via:

See you at OSCON!

Subject: [PLUG] HD recovery services
Message-ID: <4FFB7945.9070703@gmail.com>

I've taken on a client (as per my previous message about Mac OS X 
Servers) and part of the job is trying to recover some data on a drive 
that was connected to a MB when it blew.  Story has it all the caps on 
the board went.

I've tested the drive and get the same clicking the previous tech 
mentioned when the OS tries to access it.  I used an IDE to USB adapter 
and tried the old freeze the drive trick.  Powers up just fine but no 
joy beyond that.

So I went Googling for a data recovery service and so far am looking at 
Gillware Data Recovery.  I like the look because they only charge if 
they recover the data.  Anyone have experience with this company?  Any 
other recommendations?

Several years ago I used http://www.dtidata.com/   They had a much
better price than several of the others I called (none had prices
online). They recovered all my data so I was happy.

I have a neighbor who runs a business out of his house. Some years back their 
system drive died, and of course he didn't have a current backup.

We used DriveSavers Data Recovery, Inc. (http://www.drivesavers.com).
It wasn't cheap, but we were very pleased with the result.

That was 8 years ago, though.

We had a client who recently ran into a similar issue: RAID array died
and they didn't have the backups they thought they had.  Rough pricing
for 320 GB RAID5 HW array:
$15,000 for 6-10 business days turn around
$20,000 for 1-5 business days turn around

You only pay for what is recovered, although I'm not sure what that means.

I was just curious if that pricing is comparable to what others have
experienced.

I have used Gillware a few times. I found the info on their website to be
extremely accurate and forthcoming. They did not charge me for a drive they
couldn't recover (physical damage) and they even let me browse the files to
make sure what I needed was available before paying them. They accomplished
this by sending me a home-grown app (windows only, probably) that displayed
the file names.

yes, data recovery from more complex storage mechanisms is exponentially
more difficult, and thusly more expensive. I found the same pricing
structure when I looked into it. I decided the data wasn't THAT important.

Well the quote I got was for what they call a Tier 2 recovery. 
$800-$1000; 6-10 workday turn around.  Yours looks like what they call a 
Tier 3 and there was no estimate (ball park) on the site for that type 
of recovery.
    Also from the problem I was advised to not try anything else as it 
might (probably?) was a head(s) hitting a platter.

I'm still going to look at the services others have mentioned before I 
make a recommendation.

In this case it is REALLY important and the drive was the backup but 
being used in place-of the main drive when it failed.

This might be the graphic designer in me nitpicking but...

The center aligned columns are hard to read.  I would just left align
them. If you want to distinguish them,  left off set them from the left
edge of the containing box. 

the font on the inside pages seems to be rendering strangely
(specifically lower case l and  upper case I 

The titles along the top of the inner pages didn't really stand out, you
might want to consider bolding them, or using a thin rule underneath

What kind of dot gain is expected? What's the output screening/res

Subject: [PLUG] Seeking framework for mobile-connected online help system
Message-ID: <20120712140840.GM18953@eehouse.org>

My ongoing FOSS project is a networked wordgame for smartphones (see
.sig.)  It desperately needs an integrated help system, a collection
of "more info" icons each of which launches the browser and points it
at a particular page or tag on a website.  The site itself should be
easy to navigate, once you're there, to find related topics etc.

It seems I shouldn't have to write the site, or its framework, from
scratch.  Is anyone aware of an open-source project creating such a
thing?  Ideally in Python -- or at least something other than PHP,
which I'm coming to loathe as I spend more paid time with it. :-)

I'm thinking of something a bit less complicated than a wiki system,
but perhaps some of those can be configured to present simpler UIs.

Thoughts, or recommendations?

Thanks,

--Eric

Not sure if tiling is the right term, but I'm looking for a tool to take

Is there such a facility in any of open source tools folks here use?

You could probably use ImageMagick's  "convert -crop".
You'd probably have to do it in a loop, er, uh, two loops, incrementing x
and y separately.

I've not used it, myself, but PosteRazor does exactly what you want:

Thanks. Looks interesting. If I can't get ImageMagick to work, I'll 
install posterazor and give it a try.

Hello all,

Might anyone have a better copy of the PLUG Tux the Penguin logo than

floating around for a few years?

Does anyone recall who made it in the first place?

I have it as PLUG-Tux.png and PLUG-Tux.psd. The former is only 72 dpi,
which is scanty for printing. The latter is twice the byte size, so it
may have been resampled or something. However, oddly, I cannot open it
except to place it in Scribus. The .psd format is native Photoshop.
Strange that Scribus will place it, but the GImp chokes on opening it.
Maybe I need to install a plugin or something for the Gimp.

I'll work on this a bit and get back to you. 

Oh, and it might have been Keith who created it. At least I think I
remember he's the one who sent it to me when I was working on the flier.

I've tried several small Linuxes from Puppy to DSL.
They all proved that functionally I want is possible in 
small distro.
They all have a common problem - need special format 
packages for expansion, if available at all.

I want something which can be installed and then be updated 
from standard repositories. I lean towards deb packages as I 
know already packages I'll want are available there.

The standard distros are stuffed with irrelevant software 
(office suites/games/etc) AND/OR lack needed such as dialer 
for USB connected analog modem.

Normal versions of Debian and Ubuntu fail both ways.
Comments?

here is where we diverge:

there is nothing stopping you from telling ubuntu to uninstall everything
you don't want/need.

apt-get remove [thing I don't want]

it's a small effort in searching to find the necessary commands to give you
listings of what is installed currently, and (separately) to help you find
the package name of the thing you're trying to get rid of.

hint: ubuntu "server versions" are exactly identical to desktop versions,
with the GUI not installed by default.

I don't know which normal versions you are talking about, but I always
install Debian using netinst.
http://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/

At some point during the installation it asks you which type of system
you are installing and you just uncheck everything.
What you get is a very small installation that will boot to a console.

Richard,

   Really? I've installed xubuntu a couple of times but have wanted the whole
enchilada so I did not look for anything different. I'm surprised that
debian doesn't allow you to pick and choose.

   My primary distribution is Slackware and that _always_ allows me to select
exactly what I want to install. I never install the xgames group, and all
applications are in ap and xap. Networking is in n, libraries in l, and so
on. I'm sure you can create your own tiny installation very easily.

   Many additional tools are available in the SlackBuilds.org repository; you
can also easily build your own tools from source. There is a mirror
repository at slackware.osuosl.org.

Also, Bodhi linux sounds right up your alley.  It's Ubunbtu based, but very
minimal, & fast. http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=bodhi

This. You can actually do similar things with other distributions, but
basically, they make it *easy* to have tons of software, but it's
quite possible to install very, very, little.

Yes!  This is exactly what I've been doing for years.

The other thing I do on Debian, where I tend to install a lot of stuff
through aptitude, is to go into aptitude's settings and disable
"install recommended dependencies automatically".  Sometimes
recommended ones make a lot of sense.  But sometimes they lead to a
long chain of bloat that you don't need.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux Clinic - Oscon 2012 edition, Sunday July 15 1pm
Message-ID: <20120713220423.GC22756@gate.kl-ic.com>

As you all know, the PLUG Linux Clinic has achieved worldwide
fame and inspired a host of imitators since it was founded in a
Palo Alto garage in 1938.  Since Linus Torvalds hadn't been born
yet, the founders got bored and started Hewlett Packard, but the
dream remained alive, inspiring the Torvalds, the Stallmans, and
the O'Reillys to have sons, and raise them in the F/OSS way.

The young Tim O'Reilly dreamed of the day he could participate
in some small way in Linux Clinic.  Since Linus was still in
grade school, Tim decided to start a computer book business,
earning the money and building the staff he would need to someday
create OSCON.  Which is like the Linux Clinic, but way more
expensive and taking a whole week once a year, not every
third Sunday from 1pm to 5pm.  

As the clinic moved from Palo Alto, to Massachusetts, to Helsinki,
and to Riverdale High School, the city of Portland anticipated
every move, and built the Oregon Convention Center, hoping to
host the Linux Clinic.  Instead, the community built Free Geek at
1731 SE 10th, a much better home for the Linux Clinic.  All was
not lost, however, as Tim O'Reilly moved OSCON to the Convention 
Center, a mere 1.6 miles from his heros at the Clinic.

Like the Clinic, Tim's OSCON provides wifi.  The Clinic also
provides wired ethernet, screens, keyboards, and mice - Tim only
offers registration on those.  The Linux Clinic skips the long,
boring general lectures and focuses directly on your individual
issues.  We have distros, we can do installs, repairs, debugging.
We've even rewired automobile speedometers.  Tim only dreams of
such accomplishments.  He is a smart lad, he'll figure it out.

So, fly to Portland, and join us at the Linux Clinic at Free
Geek on Sunday July 15th.  In the unlikely event that we do
not satisfy your every desire, stay for the rest of the week
and blow two kilobucks on OSCON.

   The text file has > 120k rows; each row has 8 columns. There are
duplicate rows that I want to eliminate. My reading of the sort man page and
various Web pages with examples tells me that the sort --key option is
limited to a sequential starting field and ending field. What I need is to
sort on fields 1, 2, and 4.

   If 'sort' won't do this, what tool will? I don't see how awk, sed, or grep
can, yet a combination of these perhaps might.

Mutter mutter mutter - received that advice before
Aesthetically unpleasing - cf dieting after pigging out ;/

Also not guaranteed to give desired/expected result.
I don't recall particular Debian version or tool used, but 
when trying to remove Open Office was forced to not remove 
or accept alternate office suite.
There may have been unknown "operator error" involved, but 
did confirm my dislike of "remove what should never have 
been there in first place" "solution".

For 'personal preference' reasons [rather than explicitly 
technical] I'm unlikely to consider Canonical's Ubuntu.

Don't find a 'server edition' of Debian. Does it exist? How 
skinny?

The uniq(1) command can help you here, I think.  Perhaps something
along the lines of

    sort --key=1,2,4 filename.txt | uniq

would do the job?

If you are using a straight text comparision, the -u option to sort gives
you a unique list (no duplicates)

However, if they are semantically identical, but syntactically different,
this will not work.

Dale,

   This fails: sort does not like more than two digits for the key (start and
end).

   Looks like both the -u option to sort and piping the output of sort
through uniq works. Both reduce the original 122365 line file to 120853
lines.

   Thanks all for the lesson!

Ack!  You're right.  I've not used that feature of sort(1) before, and
I mis-read the man page.  mea culpa, mea culpa.

The Debian netinst boot screen also gives you the option of installing
a non-GNOME desktop (called an "alternative", under the advanced
settings menu).  You can pick from Xfce, LXDE, etc.  Just the thing if
you're working with relatively minimal resources.

You've a solution and all, but I'm curious.

If the lines are identical what difference does the sort key make?

You might look at CentOS 6.  There is a minimal DVD install.  So minimal 
I decided to go with the two DVD install because I didn't have the time 
to figure out all I wanted to add to the minimal to get it working the 
way I needed it to.

If you're mostly looking for a lighter weight GUI there are the Fedora 
spins.  Live-{XFCE,LXDE} etal.

Something that no one has mentioned, although I don't know if it is
important to Richard or not, but Ubuntu, Mint and Fedora come with an
update manager that announces available updates. You can disable it,
and I did on my Fedora laptop because it was just too much. About once
every three weeks these distros want you to install a new kernel, and
in between there is always something else that requires you to at least
log out and back in again. 

If you're in the habit of rebooting every few days it's probably not a
big deal. If you want a system that "just runs" and leaves you alone,
stay away from these distros.

Michael,

   I was trying to group duplicate rows so I could delete one of each pair.
Since this was only the second time I tried uniq I beliefe that it would
have done the job by itself; the sort was superfluous.

   Perhaps next time I'll remember uniq.

That has not been my experience with LTS Ubuntu.  I do updates often, but
most are security issues, no new kernel or logout required except very
rarely.

Message-ID: <20120720195542.33c4193d@mailhost.pdx.edu>

OSCON is over, but the memory of another grand time lingers. 

At the PLUG booth we handed out about 200 business cards (thanks for
the printing, Bill!), and around 70 fliers. It was great to see
familiar PLUG faces stop by to chat, even better to see fallen-away
PLUGGERS take a card and a flier, promising to start coming to the
meetings again. But the most wonderful ones were the new people who had
not heard of PLUG before. As they go through their schwag bags I'm
hoping that a lot of them see the business card or flier and sign up for
the lists.

O'Reilly orchestrated events beautifully, as always. The exhibitors
showed even more cost cutting on the schwag than last year. And in the
past if an evening party was any distance at all from the convention
center they hired buses to transport people, but this year you were on
your own. Not easy for the people from out of town. 

None of the cost cutting bothered me, though. These aren't boom times,
and I'm glad for our free booth and the free parties. My only real
complaint is the convention center food. Tasteless, uninspired food
doesn't speak well for Portland. Before next year's OSCON I'm going to
buy their kitchen a spice rack.

I hope everyone who attended had as much fun as I did. Portland is a
great place to be in open source!

Subject: [PLUG] Slowing down web spiders, particularly baidu
Message-ID: <20120716224852.GA6489@gate.kl-ic.com>

My websites have gigabytes of content, but very little of it is
updated frequently.  Some search engine spiders, like baidu.com,
(the big Chinese one) seem to crawl my sites continuously,
bringing apache to a standstill.  Just before I restarted apache,
netstat said baidu had 70 (out of 224) ports open, some talking
to gigabyte files.  Some claim that baidu crawls the web every
15 minutes or so.

robots.txt is simpleminded - it appears that I can only allow or
disallow baidu's spider, rather than throttle it back to one scan
per week or so.  Am I missing something?  Is there a clever but
not-too-complicated way to tell spiders to calm down a bit?

Alternately, are there any tools or standards forthcoming to 
provide a "recent changes" file to the spiders?  It would save
everyone a lot of bandwidth if spiders could check such a file
often, but otherwise not crawl the site for the same old stuff.

I've disallowed baidu in robots.txt for now, and may disallow
a few other spiders until my site responsiveness improves.  It
is a virtual server, not much horsepower.  While I would like
my occasional Chinese users to search it using baidu, it will
do them no good if the site itself is too sluggish to use.

So on I go.  I've exhausted by search foo and found nothing on where --

Running Mint 7 Gloria ...

Every so often (actually not all that often) an app freezes, most often the
browser, and the desktop stops responding. My question is what best to do
about that when it happens.

I've read about Alt + SysRq + R E I S U B ... but I haven't been able to
get that to work. (I've seen some reference online to that option being
disabled on Mint.)

Likewise Alt + F2 then running kill ... but I haven't been able to get as
far as bringing up the terminal.

Is there an alternative to get out of freezes in Mint, or is there a way to
reset Mint to accept these two options, or is there another way to deal
with this?

Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced Topics Meeting Announcement

Who: Stephen Hemminger
What: Vyatta
Where: Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue, Portland (Left Entrance)
When: Tuesday, August 21st, 2012 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of awesome, open technologies.

Linux has been used for network routing for many years, but the
interface is different than the standard network appliances.  Vyatta
is a Debian based distribution that provides an open command line
interface that looks like Cisco or Juniper. The command line is built
on top of standard bash shell with extensible template language.

This talk will go into the history of Vyatta, where it came from
and how it is used today. For those who want to contribute or modify,
it will also cover the internals of how this implemented.


Stephen Hemminger is a software engineer working remotely in Portland
for Vyatta. He has been involved with Linux networking for 8 years
and currently maintains bridging and routing utilities. Steve
regularly presents at Linux conferences.


Many will break for the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne afterwards.

I assume you're using NetworkManager, since that's Fedora's default.
First off, man NetworkManager(8), nm-tool(1), and nmcli(1).  From what
I've seen, most of the data seems to be kept in
"/var/lib/NetworkManager/" and "/etc/NetworkManager/".  HOWEVER,
things have changed since Fedora 12, including NM's data files.  It may
be easiest simply copying the information from the NM edit window(s),
then re-entering it once you've upgraded Fedora.

I'm not sure if there's a NetworkManager-specific forum or IRC
channel.  If not, try asking in #fedora on irc.freenode.net.  Since
F12 is unsupported, be sure to let them know you're wanting to
upgrade.  I don't know if anyone there knows all that much about
NetworkManager, but they may know where to go to get help.  (You could
try #Fedora-EOL, but that channel has very little traffic.)

For that matter, ask about any gotchas involved with an encrypted home
partition.  For one thing, the default userid has changed, from 500 to
1000.  That's easily fixed, but if you're not expecting it, it can
cause a bit of hair pulling.

There is a mailing list, NetworkManager-list at gnome.org.  You could ask
there.  Also, this web page has some links that may help:

    <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Tools/NetworkManager>

I hope this helps, and I'm sorry I couldn't give you the info you need.

This gives me some places to start looking.

I did see the nm stuff but didn't have the Netbook handy to give it a 
try.  I know that F12 is _*EOL*_ ... really EOL but it has been working 
fine for what I use it for and I fell updating every six months is crazy 
so I've stuck with it.

I'll avoid that.  I was hoping someone else might have run into this 
problem and solved it.  Looks like I get to be the first.

Part of the reason for updating is to get rid of the encrypted 
partition.  It made seen at the time I did it but doesn't now.

List looks good.  I should have just searched for NetworkManager instead 
of "{Fedora,Linux} wireless connection {listing, information}" and other 
similar.

This is great but if you're willing to write a script to pull the info 
I'd use it! :-)

I've heard of this before; it's a function in Flash, rather than
YouTube proper.  To disable it, right-click in the Flash window, and
select the "Global Settings..." menu item.  This will open a web page
at Adobe that shows a small preferences-type panel.  Though the page
is Adobe's, the settings are live on your system.  There is also a
"Settings..." menu item that pops up a little preferences-type panel,
and you can disable Flash's use of your camera, microphone, and
hardware acceleration from there.

Hope this helps.

I believe this is the best reference: http://www.robotstxt.org/
If Baidu doesn't follow your robots.txt, you can also do some trickery with
mod_rewrite rules in your .htaccess, based on the user agent string.  

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} Baidu [NC]  # UserAgent is Baidu
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/$            # Not on the homepage?
RewriteRule .* /                           # Then go there!
# RewriteRule .* - [F]                     # Alternate: return 403 Forbidden

Note: This is mostly from memory and not tested.  See
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html

Yay!  Hopefully not too offtopic for PLUG, but does anyone know where the
"Hack is not a four letter word" shirts came from?  I'd love to give one to
an ex-photojournalist I know.  (Or maybe to my buddy with the sidecar rig.)

At OS Bridge I was surprised at how many people haven't used LVM.  As a
result I prepared a short presentation (~20 minutes) on getting started with
LVM that is on tap if you need it..

This would be very interesting, especially if it includes how to shrink

I believe this is the best reference: http://www.robotstxt.org/
If Baidu doesn't follow your robots.txt, you can also do some trickery with
mod_rewrite rules in your .htaccess, based on the user agent string.

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} Baidu [NC]  # UserAgent is Baidu
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/$            # Not on the homepage?
RewriteRule .* /                           # Then go there!
# RewriteRule .* - [F]                     # Alternate: return 403 Forbidden

Note: This is mostly from memory and not tested.  See

Yay!  Hopefully not too offtopic for PLUG, but does anyone know where the
"Hack is not a four letter word" shirts came from?  I'd love to give one to
an ex-photojournalist I know.  (Or maybe to my buddy with the sidecar rig.)

"Hack" has many meanings,

At OS Bridge I was surprised at how many people haven't used LVM.  As a
result I prepared a short presentation (~20 minutes) on getting started with
LVM that is on tap if you need it..

This would be very interesting, especially if it includes how to shrink
a logical volume.

Thanks for the link.  Now I want to know how to avoid landing inside a
store when I want to be on the street.  Subsequent to my random visit to
the carpet place, I found the one of the white arrows pointing at 45
degrees.  It was inactive.  Maybe some bugs need to be worked out.

Thanks, Dale - i did the steps you described years ago in Firefox, and
have migrated my profile from version 3.x. up through 11; i'd forgotten
all about the Flash Settings. Flash has gotten buggier in Firefox (at
least on my system), so i've started to use Chrome only when i really need
smooth Flash playback.

Those were the official OSCON shirts for attendees. I believe I have one

Anyone successfully installed Debian using netinst.iso when

hot spot?

My success rate is "Absolute Zero" :<

Ideas? Suitable incantations?

Many, perhaps most, public wifi networks require some sort of 
click-through agreement to the local terms of service. Once the 
agreement is accepted, your route to the Internet becomes live.

The Debian installer (well, every Linux installer) doesn't allow you 
to accomplish that step before heading out to the network.

That's my best guess as to what's happening.

You might have luck in a smaller, self-managed venue like a 
neighborhood coffee shop, but it's going to be a hit-or-miss 
proposition.

Or, run a live distro and accept the clickthru and then reboot into
the installer.

But IMNSHO it's kind of a dick move to install at a coffee shop
(unless it's one that you own), since you will eat up all of the
available bandwidth at a business that is trying to serve multiple
people.

Sorry folks ;/

My questions WAS:
"Anyone successfully installed Debian using netinst.iso when
*ONLY* available internet connection was via a public Wifi
hot spot?"

Please don't GUESS at possible problems when I asked if 
anyone has *EVER* succeeded?

BTW
1. Location is a public library
2. I've routinely connected using Debian, Ubuntu and EVEN 
Windows(tm) - never having been asked to agree to any terms. LOL

Being in a distant suburb (~2000 miles SE) , AKA "Show Me 
State" ;)
"And the answer is ??? ??????"

Chuckle, but I've only dial-up available at home -- that's

Afraid there is a generation gap (errr chasm) here. I'm 
familiar with the Count of Monte Christo ;) I looked at 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Point! and missed the point.

I've done it with Sidux, a distro based on Debian Sid. The installer
detects there's no Ethernet connection, the active wireless radio and
prompts to install the correct wireless driver. So perhaps Debian stable
doesn't have this feature and you don't have a wireless driver installed
and working?

[GRIN} I too suffered culture shock moving from Boston and 
NYC to an area so rural that cattle, hogs, and chickens each 
outnumber people.

Caveat: never used Mint, don't know it from Adam.  But does Ctrl + Alt + 
F2 get you a terminal?

It might not - if the system is sufficiently wedged, you won't be able to 
wrest control back from the X server.  But that's what I've used for the 
past 15 years or so on SuSE and Slackware.

It would probably be much more pleasant to install from the
installation DVD. Even if the library wifi does work, what happens
when later you want to install another package or maybe even
reinstall. Then you have to do it over the modem or head down to the
Library. You can buy the installation DVD's for about $3 - $6 from
several places http://www.debian.org/CD/vendors/#us. Somebody in the
group might even have a copy to send you.

If you have ssh running you can often ssh in even if X is frozen. Just
log in from another machine/phone and kill the offending browser.

Solving the wrong problem [*GRIN*]
Installs fine from any of several versions of the LiveCD.
WiFi works fine after those installs.
The problem with _those_ installs is that you get something 
claiming "to be everything to everybody". Even P.T. Barnum 
knew better ;)

I have been told that netinst is capable of the fine control 
of *initially* installed packages that I desire. Besides 
netinst should work. There's a subtle bub in here somewhere. 
I'm retired. Therefore have time to searching and testing 
that various people suggest.

Solves wrong problem. I'm looking to do a lean/sparse/??? 
install.
As to LiveCD's, they all do fine install (WiFi and all).
I'm specifically wanting to get a working netinst.iso as 
I've been told that will give me the fine control of 
initially installed packages.

There is nothing about the DVD that requires you to do a full install.
Just make sure that you uncheck __every__ single box when it asks you
what you want to install.

I find it useful to jog my thought process to ask in an

Maybe you should describe your problem to the librarians.  Maybe they
will let you plug in to the public part of their network.  Librarians
(at least reasonably enlightened ones) are sort of all about solving
"information needs" and tend to be sensitive to "digital divide"
issues like the one you are describing.

Of course, you run the risk of getting veto'd by unenlightened
tight-ass network admins that are terrorized by the idea of anyone
"untrusted" using their network.  But maintaining the divisions
between information haves/havenots isn't what public libraries are
for, and maybe you can gently remind them of that.

It isn't so much that the netinst or biz card image will give you fine
control, such as Gentoo, but that it installs only the base system or just
the installer. Any packages beyond that have to be selected and then
downloaded from the internet.

"*What is the difference between the netinst and the business card images?*
The netinst image contains the installer and the base system. It will allow
you to install a very basic system from the CD; any other packages you
might want to install have to be downloaded from the internet.

The business card image is smaller than the netinst image to fit on
business-card sized cds. It does not contain the base system, but only the
installer: even the base packages need to be downloaded from the net."
Install via wifi is supported, "but with some restrictions." I presume
those restrictions are that in order for the install to work over wifi,
there must be a driver that supports your wireless card in the kernel
image.

This was the problem I ran into when I attempted to do a Debian Lenny
netinstall over wifi on my Thinkpad T40 a few years ago.

"The network install assumes that you have a connection to the Internet.
Various different ways are supported for this, like analogue PPP dial-up,
Ethernet, WLAN (with some restrictions),"

Most public wifi hotspots, free or not, do use a captive portal page that
requires the user to accept their terms & conditions of use. Which would
require the use of a browser. Which is not yet installed.

The bad news is that nobody on the PLUG list has done this specific type of
install successfully. The good news is that you have the opportunity to
figure it out, document it and contribute something to the Linux community!
:-)

I've always used SNMP/MRTG to capture and present system performance
information (NIC utilization, CPU load, memory load, paging, disk wait time,
etc.).  These are "just OK" in my book.  I find MRTG in particular finicky
and unnecessarily complex to set up.  Not hard, just a lot of nuisances.  I
know there must be better, widely available packages that aren't so heavy
they distort the numbers significantly or a hassle to install.  I don't need
a lot of super features, just the basics of how is the system running and
what are the trends.   So, what are all you cool kids out there (and
everyone else) using for this in modern times?

While it didn't meet my needs, I found that Munin was pretty good for
setting up and displaying data.  My biggest problem was it collected (nad
stored in rrd) data on a 5 minute intervals.  I needed something with a
little more granularity.

I've also looked at Ganglia, and it seemed a lot better in some regards,
but I had some issues on a non-flat network (multiple VLANs) that I didn't
take a lot of time to investigate.

Both have a variety of plug-ins for various things and were fairly easy to
install and use.  And both had ways to add your own data into the system
fairly easily.

I was able to come up with two "hack... four letter word" shirts but 
they are size small. Sorry! David should have these with him.

Have fun!

In fact I was just talking the reference librarian just 
yesterday about a related problem. Seems that up until a 
couple of years ago a few wired connection were available to 
the public. They were removed ;)

I don't know enough about system implications to argue for a 
change. But the relatively large number of public access 
terminals and a very satisfactory WiFi connectivity seems to 
be reasonable compromise between "my champagne tastes/dreams 
and their beer budget".

If I interpret correctly what I read at gentoo.org and on

get netinst working to determine if it attempts to do what

I believe my my wireless card is supported. Someone over on

diagnostics to confirm.

There was a recent bugfix in testing (I've misplaced the

Nary a terms nor conditions page ;)

Nor, I'm beginning to suspect, has anyone on the Debian

I suspect "document" is a very key word. I predict an

Subject: [PLUG] xubuntu usb flash install
Message-ID: <5011A124.4010807@seitzassoc.com>

How to waste an entire morning:

I wanted to do a clean install of xubuntu 12.04 alternate(needed lvm)
on my X40 laptop, so I used usb-creator-gtk to put the iso install
image on a 1 GB usb flash drive using a Prolific Technology chip.
With every install attempt I would get a "Your installation CD-ROM
couldn't be mounted." shortly after the detecting hardware message.
After much trial and error, I tried a different 1 GB usb flash drive,
a Corsair Flash Voyager.  Lo and behold, it worked.  I subsequently
did a dd copy of the entire Corsair to the Prolific drive.  The
Prolific drive still failed at the mount cd-rom step.  I compared the
Corsair contents with the Prolific, and they are identical.

My best guess as to root of the problem is this output from lsusb.

Bus 002 Device 032: ID 067b:2515 Prolific Technology, Inc. Flash Disk
Embedded Hub
Bus 002 Device 033: ID 067b:2517 Prolific Technology, Inc. Flash Disk
Mass Storage Device
Bus 002 Device 034: ID 090c:1000 Feiya Technology Corp. Flash Drive

The Feiya Tech device is the Corsair drive.  Note how the Prolific
drive has an embedded hub.  My guess is that this is tripping up the
kernel/installer.  I've had this drive for quite some time.  It's
possible that this drive might have had the U3 'feature'.
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U3

Anyway, I guess the moral of the story is to try multiple usb flash
drives before giving up, and perhaps beware of drives that hide behind
embedded hubs.

It's appearing to be one of those cases where a newbie is 
inherently a better tester than an expert. If what my gut 
says is the problem is right, an expert would read the 
instructions as intended. The cure may be as minor as 
rephrasing a prompt. I've some more testing to do, there may 
be an actual software bug also.

Yes. I'm using MythTV.

I recommend HDHomeRun. The one I'm currently using originally set me back 
~$200, but I just picked up a newer one at Fry's for $79. I haven't tried it 
yet, but it's supposed to work out of the box with MythTV, just like the 
original.

There was a discussion on the list back around 11/23 about 'Tiny "desktop" 
computers' that might be relevant. The Jetway HBJC231C98-525-B looked 
interesting. Unfortunately I don't have any personal experience.

Randy,
Your best bet for help with linux Mint is irc.  #linuxmint-help on
irc.spotchat.org.  I use the KDE version of Linux Mint, so the key commands
are different than Gnome.  Mint 7 is no longer supported, so people will
probably nag you to use a supported version, but if you keep asking,
they'll help.

Cheers,
Elcaset

I believe that's accurate. I know that this was the case when I looked into it last summer.

I don't. I fantasize about finding work abroad and decided to focus on LPI certificates. But, I am curious about what kind of lab you set up for you RHCSA study.

darn. it seems a mite surprising that this would be the case, but I

my "lab" is a fluctuating number of CentOS KVM guests based on how 
functional any of them are at a given time. The minimum number of rhel 
images you can get away with is about 3. I've just been working through 
chapters 1-9 of Michael Jang's "RHCSA/RHCE Red Hat Linux Certification 
Study Guide".

I didn't know you were on the list! Thanks for writing such a great

Cheers,
