Hi.

	I'm currently tasked with the job of learning how the internals (source code) 
of two large programs work---namely <a 
href="http://www.moodle.org">Moodle</a> and <a 
href="http://www.civicspacelabs.org">Civicspace</a>, a derivative of <a

least semi-competently, I have never really taken on the task of learning how 
the internals of a large program work. 

	Does anyone here know of any good references (books, websites, etc) I can 
look at that guide people in studying the source code of large programs? I'm 
not sure this is the right place to be asking for this kind of help, but I've 
tried google and have found nothing too useful.

	Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

I'm assuming that you're planning on modifying the mentioned products in 
some way or adding additional features, not merely using their public 
APIs.  With most source code, I think one of the only ways is simply to 
dive in.  You may want to learn the basics of the programming languages 
that the source code is written in first, but it's not necessary because 
you'll probably learn the language as you read and try to understand the 
source anyway.  Many projects come with at least some development 
documentation such as their public API, class structures, etc.  It is 
worth familiarizing yourself with this information, and you should also 
join any related [development] mailing lists if you have not yet done 
so.  I doubt there will be that many books on the internal workings of 
any particular product; if so, they will usually be out of date.

Some tips based on how I personally tackle new source code:
1.  try to read as much information about the product as you can and try 
to understand the bigger picture.  Maybe try to use the application from 
a user's point of view.
2.  look for any API or internal-related documentation on their official 
website(s); try to determine how pieces fit together as much as possible.
3.  download and install the source code, play around with the 
management interfaces (command-line options, configuration settings, 
etc) and get a feel for how they affect the product.
4.  start to slowly examine the source code looking for features that 
are familiar to you (either from public APIs or configuration settings) 
and track these changes through the source code.  Some useful places to 
start is a main() type function if they have one, or from the outermost 
code that interacts with the user in some form; these are the best 
places to start because you are already somewhat familiar with what they 
are supposed to do.
5.  document anything that appears interesting to you or things you do 
not immediately understand.  You can do this in the source code using 
comments, possibly with special markers to make them easier to 
find/search ("// !!! I don't know what this does, might be related to 
... !!! //").  It's also worth writing down on paper a little bit bigger 
piece of the picture such as how some functions and/or classes fit 
together if there is not already good documentation on this.  I find 
documenting things (especially in source) very important for me to learn 
things, even if there is some documentation already.  The actually 
process of documenting helps you learn; sometimes I will comment every 
single line of source code in a function with a comment that is a 
English sentence equivalent of what the code should do.  In theory, I 
could strip all the code, leaving only comments and be able to read 
and/or rewrite the code from scratch if I wanted to.
6.  start to make minor modifications to the source code and see if the 
changes you make produce the results you expect.  Some examples of this 
could be resizing a window or changing a color.  You're basically 
starting to test yourself to see if you can predict the behavior of the 
program.  If you can, you're well on your way.

Cheers,

Daniel Hedlund

All of Daniel's suggestions are good and in addition, if you use vi or
vim and ctags, it is easier to navigate code.  I personally have not
followed the links to see what language the code was written in to see
if ctags supports the language.

Daniel,

   I was thinking of this when I responded. In 1991 I bought my first laptop,
from Gateway (but it was made for them by TI). In the 13th month the power
supply -- internally -- failed. The warranty was 12 months. So, I paid for a
repair. Thirteen months later the same thing happened. Gateway admitted it
was a design or manufacturing flaw and there were many of us with the same
problem. That's when I gave it away. And wouldn't consider another Gateway
product.

   So, you're correct that it may be an internal problem. That's why I
suggested NCS. They'll run the tests to determine the source of the problem
first.

   I'd run it in the appropriate debugger, stepping through one line at a
time. Also, depending on the language, you can get tools like TAGS that show
what functions call other functions. Source navigator (I don't recall the
URL off-hand) also does a lot of analyses for you ... if it works
completely.

Your laptop is a different make but I've seen this sort of behavior with Dell 
laptops at one company I worked at. In one case the battery wasn't being kept 
charged but in other cases with the same laptop model the battery was OK. We 
had a Dell tech on site quite a bit replacing mobos in a number of laptops 
which were all the same model. 

The laptops were P4 based and ran extremely hot. Doing anything that required 
any sort of computing power had the fan running full speed making a great 
deal of noise. Other problems with the laptops was after turning it off and 
placing it into a case some of them would mysteriously turn themselves back 
on and cook itself in its own juices inside the case.

With all of the issues though I actually bought my own Dell laptop but it's 
Pentium M-based and runs much cooler than the old P4-based one I had at work. 
I also got a 3 year warranty included as part of the package with the laptop 
when I ordered it from Costco. I don't think I'd buy any brand of laptop 
without an extended warranty though but that's just me.

When I bought my HP laptop two years ago I made sure that I got the 3 year 
uber warranty.  I am very glad I did.  I have had to use it twice.  Once 
to fix a damaged cardbus slot and once for a dead power brick.  (Both in 
the space of a month. In fact, I need to get it in the mail for the second 
repair.)  One of the main factors in getting the HP zv5000z was because of 
the warranty. (Besides being the fastest laptop I could find.)

It is worth the money to get the extra warranty as long as they will 
replace or fix it with no questions asked.

One thing I would recommend would be to involve yourself in any
listserves or other devices that may get you in contact with the
specific development community. 
Just recently I got a bur in my saddle and wanted to change a piece of
software. First I went to their site and gathered as much info as
possible and then contacted the mailing list. To my surprise someone had
already proposed the changes I was thinking of and they were available
in the next release.
So get yourself as close to the central nerve as possible. This will
save you time in duplicated efforts and you will probably be able to
collaborate and help others. 
Hope this helps.

You do not buy laptops, you rent them from the repair shop.  My Thinkpad
has been back 4 times, and when I bought it (with the max warranty, and
later an extension) that was reputedly the best warranty available.
If you buy a third-tier brand such as an Acer, you may end up treating
it as a disposable.  Designers must cut a lot of reliability corners to
pack the performance into a small case, and laptops get a lot more
pounding than a desktop, so it makes sense that they will fail.

There are many things that can go wrong with laptop power.  If the
laptop goes on for 5 seconds and quits, it is likely because the AC
adapter or the internal charger is dead.  It is always good to have
more than one AC adapter just because it is a pain in the rear to plug
and unplug them;  if they have good switcher circuits inside they do
not waste much power.  So, an adapter at home, an adapter at work,
and an adapter for travel.  Free Geek may have spares, or check Ebay.

You can test an AC adapter with a /volt/meter.  

If the AC adapter is good, then the problem could be the charging
circuit inside the laptop.  This is responsible for both charging
the battery, and for sending power to the laptop bypassing the 
battery.  These charger circuits go out a lot - I've lost two so far.   
If your laptop is out of warranty, there are shops that can fix it.
If the charger went out because something else is shorted inside
the laptop, the repair may be too expensive.  On the other hand,
it might just be a loose connector or a killer dust bunny.

This is why I am skeptical of the One Laptop Per Child initiative.
Very high stress environment (kids, bad power, dirty, hot, humid),
with repair facilities a long way away.  I hope the massive failures
do not get blamed on Linux.

My HP has been pretty good. One failure was damage that I did to it and 
one was the external power brick dying.  I have not dropped it yet.  (Eric 
dropped his and it survived pretty well. He has almost the same model as I 
do.)

My last couple of laptops had no real problems until the end of life.

The Toshiba died from being knocked off a shelf by a stack of PGP 
software boxes.

The Vaio died after one or more of the soldered on the motherboard 
batteries died.  (Planned obsolecense.)  I have vet to fix them.

This is my third laptop and it has worked very well.  It is a heavy 
monster, but sturdy.  I guess when it has that big of a screen, you have 
more room to place components and less need for shortcuts.

I believe that obtaining music in a different form other than purchased

rotfl!

I think I'd be a bit more qualified. The majority (I'm guessing 60 to 
65%, but it's just a guess) of laptops I've administered have needed 
one or zero repairs during the three years an extended warranty would 
cover. That is to say that, most of the time, the $300 warranty cost 
is wasted or, at best, a wash.

However ... a solid minority of laptops have required multiple 
repairs. Some are lemons. Some just have bad luck. Some have, er, 
demanding users. Whatever the reason, the extended warranty has been 
essential to keeping the machine running.

Like any insurance, an extended warranty is a bet. For me, I'll take 
the insurance on laptops every time. I've dealt with too many 
situations where I'd have essentially thrown away the purchase price 
of the laptop had it not been for the warranty.

And even the web browsing can be encrypted over the wireless network

I'm testing out Qwest DSL w/MSN Premium and I can't seem to find any 
mail server or SMTP server information.  It seems as though there is 
some proprietary MSN/micro$oft mail http connection.  Is this correct, 
or is there a regular mail setup somewhere?

I'm using the Thunderbird mail client.

TIA,

The following blog seems to have some answers to your question:
http://www.alexking.org/blog/2003/12/30/msn-qwest-dsl-does-not-support-smtp/

Essentially, some people suggest that you can sign up with FastMail 
(http://www.fastmail.fm/).  Some people later comment that there is a 
pop and smtp server at:
"pop3.email.msn.com
smtp.email.msn.com

youruserid at msn.com
your passwd"

Someone else suggests that it's possible to use QWest's SMTP server 
(smtp.qwest.com).  I didn't read much further than that.

I've always found that if I get an extended warranty in most cases I've never 
had to use it. But as soon as I buy a product and don't get the extended 
warranty the unit seems to die shortly after the standard warranty coverage 
has expired. :-/

I'm trying to find some PDAs to compare that would interoperate with KDE's PIM suite, including korganizer, kaddressbook, kmail, etc. I've googled and found information about utilities within KDE to accomplish the synchronization (multisynk) but nothing about what PDAs work and how well.

What I'd love is a site like linuxprinting.org for PDAs.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

This is for my mother, who's only mildly literate with anything computer related, and on a budget.

Thanks in advance,
Aaron

Have a look at:
http://cvs.codeyard.net/kpilot/hardware.php

It contains a list of PDA devices that are known to be compatible with 
KPilot, and thus probably compatible with other KDE PIM apps.

I have an HP 17" widescreen, that I bought the 5 year warranty for.  The 
only thing that the warranty doesn't cover is a battery after 1 year.

EVEN if I drop it, run over it, spill coke, etc. - they send a new one.  
So far I've killed 2 DVD drives, one hard drive, a set of hinges for the 
screen, and one motherboard/processor combo (the integrated video 
died).  Total cost of the repairs would have been about what I paid for 
the entire setup, so it was majorly worth it.

I purchased the business warranty (5 years) vs. the 4 years for home 
use.  Worth every penny.  I also obtained the additional hard drive bays 
so I can swap in & out drives from the 3 media bays.  You can put a HDD 
into the DVD and/or floppy bays - for a total of 3.  Backups are in full 
real-time rather than going through a USB drive, very slowly.

It DOES get hot - so I have a hole cut in my desk beneath the fans for 
forced air, using 2 case fans.  It's AMAZINGLY cool.  I basically have a 
desktop replacement.

It's a 3 gigahertz computer so it will stand up to YEARS of use and be 
totally usable.  64-bit - well, they still compile for i386 on many 
Linux platforms so I think I'm safe with the P4 rather than the 64-bit.

Plus the processor is a desktop processor - fully socketed so I can 
replace or upgrade as I wish.

4 USB ports and 1 mini firewire so that is pretty well taken care of 
too.  The screen was the brightest available at the time, and has 
1600x1050 resolution.

If you get one, GET the warranty - next business day on-site.  Have some 
backup items like spare hard drives and a spare power brick, spare 
battery if you can afford it.  The power bricks are the cheap part.  And 
get the additional hard drive trays & you'll be all set!

I couldn't be happier with mine.  Just make SURE you back up your data 
regularly - notebook drive platters are made of glass and shatter like a 
windshield if dropped too hard, COMPLETELY wiping out all hope of 
recovery if there is no backup.

Don't forget to check the fine print on your credit card benefits
statement.  You may be able to get coverage beyond the manufacturer's
warranty.  For example:

  "Extended Warranty Protection: When you purchase your item entirely on
  your REI Visa Gold card, Visa will automatically double the
  manufacturer's written U.S. repair warranty up to one year on
  warranties of three years or less."

It should be noted that I've never actually made a claim under this.

I was just using one of "your" nodes last night, considering this.  (At
Anna Bananas in st johns, tyvm).   I'm guessing that to do this I would
follow these steps:

1) set up squid/privoxy (privoxy? really?)  on my local (home) linux
box. 

2) open up the firewall for a specific port to match the
squid/privoxy. 

3) when I was out in the wild, using my (gag) windows
based laptop, use putty and forward a local port on the laptop to the
port at my home firewall.

4) configure firefox on the laptop to use the laptop as a proxy.

When the packets get to the linux box, how does the linux box know to
decrypt them? Am I missing any steps? That's pretty much the extent of
my knowledge- so if you know of an already written how-to, I could use
it :) But don't write one, I can google with the rest of the herd.

No, as long as you're allowing SSH in, you don't need this.

Uh, it's just part of the SSH connection?

You should just read up on SSH port-forwarding.  You're just going to
forward a port on your laptop (localhost) over an SSH tunnel to the
proxy port on your firewall or server (localhost, again).  From the
outside, it's all just SSH port 22 traffic.

Does Linux have output in proc providing the average amount of memory
that the system needs?  Why not increase the physical ram till
you have more than that amount and disable swap completely?  I am
concerned, as I'm certain many are, that swapping destroys hard drives.
If what is swapped does not need to persist after a reboot, how about
an ide drive that allows you to use normal memory sticks or a pci
memory card for swapping?  I hear you can get a battery backed up ram
card that plugs into, I guess, the ide bus.  Theoretically, if swap
memory is fast enough, swapping is not a big deal.  Evem if you need
2 gigs of swap, it's feasible to buy that much ram.  Will Linux use
swap even if it isn't out of ram?

Curious,

Michael C. Robinson

Message-ID: <1154461024.8464.62.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Anyone here use this?

http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/

How do people side step the, "no bare metal recovery," issue?

I don't want to fish for say a working Windows XP install CD
so I can install fresh far enough to overwrite with a backed
up system.  I want to be able to network boot the machine
with the necessary replacement hardware installed, push a 
button, and leave.

I'm hoping I can use something other than dd.  If I
dd image say Windows XP/2000 so I can restore it back exactly 
the same, compression isn't possible.  If I know exactly
where Windows XP bootloader is...  I can probably use dd
to only image that piece.  It would make sense to figure out 
which files on an XP/2000 partition have to be put back in 
the exact same place and image just those files recording 
an offset to put them back.  The trouble if you target image, 
how do you back up only what remains afterwards?
You don't want to restore a file in the place it has to
be written to and somewhere else as this will probably
corrupt the filesystem.  If you image everything, there is
no compression and the added trouble of writing multiple 
images back in the right order.  Smaller images might be
more manageable, but organization is tougher.

Is bare metal recovery possible without dd or is dd the only
way, especially if you don't have say NTFS filesystem support
and you need it?



Begin Digression...
So far, I'm assuming it's okay to say no to NTFS when 
installing 2000/XP to sidestep the lack of open source 
support.  A filesystem that you can't back up isn't a 
good deal in my opinion.  I bet Reiserfs would give 
Windows a better boost than NTFS does.

I suppose if all your Windows systems run on top of Linux,
backup gets enormously easier.  Thing is, vmware costs a
lot of money where I am concerned that not everything
works under emulation.  You don't keep Windows around to
browse the web unless you have to have Weatherbug or a 
similar web app that isn't available for Linux.  It bothers
me that there aren't better sites to address migration
problems if you're trying to get people out of Windows.
I checked out the Linspire web site and wasn't impressed, 
people need to support some XP/2000 programs to get out of 
Windows completely.  A friend needs to support Mapinfo for 
example.  He is into Family Tree also.  TurboTax is popular, 
but will Intuit or whoever puts it out ever release a Linux 
version?  I don't know what went wrong when Corel attempted 
to move their major software to Linux.  $50+ for Linspire.
Geez, I can almost buy XP Home for that and not worry about
compatibility.  Do Linspire users get free upgrades???

Are there any success stories of companies leaving MS Windows
and moving their major software to Linux?

What is stopping talented programmers from making it in 
commercial softwares ventures that target Linux?

I don't see Pentium M as an option when I compile a 2.6 kernel.

If laptops were standardized to a form factor, the monitor
detached, the keyboards were replacable, I think they'd be a very 
different story.

Why is it cheaper to get an LCD monitor by buying a laptop than it is to buy
one for a  desktop?

Anyone here familiar with it?  It's an attempt to implement the Win32

http://www.reactos.org/xhtml/en/index.html

If the developers can get it far enough along, maybe it will support
old Windows games.  I think they should stabilize what they have and
see if programmers who won't develop for Linux will accept ReactOS.
It looks like the ReactOS teams needs more programmers in it.

I've looked on Freshmeat and maybe I'm not using the right keywords.
Does anyone know of an server or application for automating moving
around files?  This is for EDI and similar files; basically, we have
dozens of jobs that pull files from one server and push them to another,
in some cases making transformations like encrypting them with PGP.
These transfers happen mainly over FTP and SFTP, depending on the other
party's capabilities; sometimes they happen on a schedule, sometimes
they happen on some external trigger like an e-mail with a particular
subject (I don't like that, but it's what I've got at the moment), with
notification and error reporting via log, e-mail, etc.  I don't need to
read or write or transform EDI or HIPAA file formats, I just need to
move them around, basically.

I can imagine describing these processes in a higher-level language than
what I have now, but I haven't actually found anything that does this.

  It sounds like a task for a standard batch control system.  Batch
systems commonly use the absence or presence of a file to trigger a
action.

Triggering the action isn't the problem; the action is the problem.
What I want to do is to model a transfer "recipe" like this (using a
vaguely fetchmail-ish syntax):

id FOOBASH834:
  get via ftp
    username userx
    password passw0rd
    server datamunger.mycompany.com
    path /munged_stuff/${JOB_ID}.txt

  encrypt with pgp key id 0xffffff
  sign with pgp key id ${MY_PGP_KEY}
  compress with gzip

  send via sftp
    username mycompanyuser
    password p4ssword
    server sftpserver.othercompany.com
    path /whatever/mycompany/

  notify
    mail info to notify-users at mycompany.com
    mail errors to data-transfer-admins at mycompany.com
    syslog info "data transfer ${JOB_ID} ${JOB_STATUS}"
    cmd info send_nsca -H nagioshost ... # Some Nagios passive info her

  keep local file 60 days
  delete source file

  # Some other sort of stuff here        


The salient points here are:
  o I don't care about the contents of the files, because those are 
    generated or processed by other systems, except for transformations 
    like encrypting, signing, gzipping.
  o I don't care about triggering the jobs; that's also external.
  o Notifications, transfers, and standard transformations are critical.
  o All the tools necessary to do this are available--sundry scripting 
    languages, ftp/sftp/pgp/gpg/gzip clients, etc., but the tools alone 
    are not the whole task.

I guess you can't run the process on the machine on which the files
originate? I have used 'dnotify', but it wants to see new files by just
opening a local directory. Source is available, so I guess it could be
hacked, but it sounds like you're looking for an "install configure run"
solution.

Hmm. Maybe 'monit' could do it? It can do lots of things, is somewhat
pluggable, and knows about sending email on events.

Hm, not really.  I really only have full access to my host itself, which
you might think of as a hub for these transfers.  The problem isn't
figuring out that the files are there, it's concisely and effectively
representing and monitoring the transfers themselves.

In the Commercial Enterprise non-opensource sort of world you're talking
about something like Tidal Enterprise Scheduler right?

http://www.tidalsoftware.com/products/products_TES_Overview.asp

Although the site sucks and it's all marketing speak and there are no
screen shots of the actual product. You're looking for something similar
in the Open Source world?

I don't think so.  We've actually got Tidal, although I haven't looked
carefully at it, it's just a batch scheduler, AFAIK.  There are several
open source batch schedulers.

What I'm looking for is something more like this, I think:

http://www.proginet.com/products/cyberfusion_integration_suite/cfi_overview.cfm
http://www.proginet.com/solutions/filetransfer/overview.cfm

I'm suspecting that this is a pretty expensive package, given prices are
discreetly not mentioned on their site.  It also doesn't seem to
directly support PGP encryption, although it seems to support a myriad
of other means of securing transfer.

So far, this is actually about the only thing I've found, proprietary,
open source or otherwise.  I'm rather surprised, really--this was a
recurring problem with my last job too.  I wonder if it's a problem
that's too easily solved in the simple cases for anyone to have bothered
solving it in the bigger?  When I say bigger, I'm talking about 200+
configured transfers, which is why a pile of shell scripts around wget,
scp, etc are no longer adequate.

Kids, please don't try this at home!  I assumed that suggestion would be
interpreted as a joke, but apparently not.  While touching a standard 9V
battery to your tongue doesn't present much danger, an AC adapter is a
different story.  A poorly designed or failing adapter could present a
serious risk.  Please use a voltmeter to check something like this.

That's MHO.  Perhaps Keith will comment.

Apparently the key phrase is "managed file transfer"; I've found quite a
few more applications now, no F/OSS though.

Hi.

	I don't know anything about backuppc. However, to answer your question about 
software existing to perform bare metal restores (if I understand you 
correctly, a bare metal restore is a level 0 restore), mondo does the job 
beautifully. It can even backup NTFS partitions. There are some limitations 
to this, though, and it would be good to read mondo's documentation at 
http://www.mondorescue.org/docs/mondorescue-howto/index.html

Exactly.  I still don't understand what about your problem wouldn't be
trivial to handle with common shell tools, and a simple tabular file of
file-transfer specs.

On an unrelated note, I'm typing this from one of the new Ubuntu Dapper
workstations in PSU's Intel Lab.  I'm just peeved that they waited 'til
I was nearly done with my degree.

Absolutely!  I had mentioned for the user to use a ammeter, but was 
probably foolish enough to mention the alternative which they could try 
if they were "stupid enough".  I probably should have added an 
additional warning explaining "why" I said "stupid enough ..." though. 
It's really about weighing risks.  The voltage that comes out of the 
power brick is DC 12-17v and thus doesn't oscillate near your heart 
rate, but the amperage (1-2.5amp) is sufficiently high enough that it 
definitely is no 9v battery either!  A wet tongue and the proximity 
between positive and negative make it less likely that it could kill 
you, but with an undiagnosed heart problem it is still possible.  I 
never thought to take in consideration that the power brick might 
exhibit excessive current such as if a resistor failed or a capacitor 
was overcharging itself; you have brought this to my attention as a 
valid possibility.  In my case, I've been stupid enough far too many 
times when an ammeter isn't handy, but I was willing to take that risk 
at the time.  For reference, what I originally recommended is below:

"You can test this by using an ammeter on the end of the cable...or for 
those people who are poor or stupid enough like myself, you could always 
try sticking your tongue on the end of the cord"

The real danger is from the possibility of the higher voltage from the
wall outlet leaking through the adapter.  This could happen due to poor
design or failing components.  Here's a good link:

http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_1/chpt_3/4.html

and a quote from the link:

"In industry, 30 volts is generally considered to be a conservative
threshold value for dangerous voltage. The cautious person should regard
any voltage above 30 volts as threatening, not relying on normal body
resistance for protection against shock. That being said, it is still an
excellent idea to keep one's hands clean and dry, and remove all metal
jewelry when working around electricity. Even around lower voltages,
metal jewelry can present a hazard by conducting enough current to burn
the skin if brought into contact between two points in a circuit. Metal
rings, especially, have been the cause of more than a few burnt fingers
by bridging between points in a low-voltage, high-current circuit."

I wanted to try installing it directly, but couldn't get that to work.
Anyone know if there is an alternative to floppy boot of ReactOS?  I
get the impression that the install to MBR option doesn't install
anything.  The developers of ReactOS should get away from putting
the bootloader in the MBR in my opinion and shoot for grub/lilo
compatibility.  I want to run it directly on the hardware.  It would
be a lot more convenient to install the bootloader to the ReactOS
partition and have grub launch it.  Maybe the ReactOS people need to
talk to the FreeDos people.

Aside...
What's up with Freedos being stuck in hard freeze?

Michael C. Robinson

Quoting plug_0 at robinson-west.com:

Is implementing the Win32 API seperately from Microsoft without Microsoft's 
code legal?  I've heard a pessimistic view that the ReactOS project will be 
sued out of existence by Microsoft.  Well, I for one would pay the project's
legal costs if I could in the event it gets sued by Microsoft.

Linux is implemented on the same hardware that Windows is, how are the x86
Linux drivers insulated from Microsoft lawsuits?

I see that ReactOS is being heavily code audited.  I think ReactOS with
enough big vendors behind it can survive any patent fight.  If enough
people want a Windows compatible system that they can give away, even
for older software, it would seem certain that ReactOS can survive.

I bet the makers of vmware could be interested considering that it's
impossible to buy licensed copies of say Windows 95/98 anymore.  I
don't know about other people, but I'm not into running illegal
copies of Windows.  There is nothing in the Microsoft EULA that
says, "we won't prosecute licensing violations when we stop supporting 
this release of Windows," but there should be.

Maybe it's time for the U.S. Congress to act in order to
protect competition in the computer industry from Microsoft's 
anticompetitive practices.  The Supreme Court isn't going to.

To make that happen we'll need lobbyi$t$ who can compete against more 
than Microsoft. Just when early Disney cartoons (Steamboat Willie) were 
about to go into the public domain, their lobbyists convinced Congress 
to extend their copyright protection.

Copyright and patent laws have been sold to the highest bidder.

With all the squawking about "the founders' intent" that's floated about 
in the last few years, why don't they look at the founders' intent when 
it comes to encouraging the flow of ideas to the public?

DR Dos implemented a full version of DOS with enhancements without looking at
Microsoft's code.  There implementation was so much better that Microsoft placed
specific code into Windows 3.1 to prevent it from running on top of DR
DOS.  That
prompted a lawsuit the other direction.

Because it is implemented in a whitebox manner or totally via
open/published api.

I know that it is still possible to buy site/company wide licenses of
these OS's
provided you don't care or want support.

It would be like implementing an MTA with netcat and shell.

Starting to sound like a new open source project to me.
A few primary pieces.
1) something to parse configuration files for transfers
2) Simple linkage mechanism for starting transfers (triggers,cron,
directory watch)
3) Generalized code for running/monitoring the transfer utilities with
    a method to re-schedule when the transfer fails.
4) Possibly a database to allow this to all be tied together (sqlite)
5) A GUI interface to allow non-technical people to easily add and
remove transfers

Yes, you've given that impression.  File transfers are easy.  Scheduling
is easy.  What is it about your problem that makes it *not* easy?

I'm totally missing something here, and I'd rather find out here than by
making a fool of myself at work.

Individual file transfers are easy.  Gluing it all together into a
cohesive system handling the myriad combinations of transfer protocols,
login information, encryption applications, notifications, auditing,
gracefully handling the myriad of ways each component can fail -- and
doing it well -- is hard.  But it's not hard in any interesting
sense--not like, say, the Red Army / Blue Army problem or solving a
Rubik's cube is hard.  It's hard in the sense that doing it right would
require 20-80 man-hours that I necessarily have to spare.

What I've got now is several dozen scripts that do all of this stuff,
each of which is "easy" on its own, but all piled on top of one another,
is a huge fucking mess.  Almost all of these are descended from three or
four proto-scripts and copied and slightly tweaked to do something
different.  I *can* try to refactor them, eliminate the duplication,
etc., but these scripts are in production and tinkering around with them
is not a good idea.  Many of them are ksh, which is harder to unit-test
than Perl/Python/Ruby.  Network transactions are also a lot harder to
design unit-tests for.

Let's consider the implementation details for a single FTP PUT.  You've
got to:

  o Check that the local file exists and produce an appropriate message 
    if it doesn't.
  o Check if the file is zero-length.  For legacy reasons, some files 
    will always exist, but not really be the desired file until it 
    actually has data.  In other cases, you have to upload an empty 
    file even if there is no file, or copy a CSV template with just 
    headers (a CSV file with no records, in other words).
  o Figure out the name the resulting file should have.
  o Figure out the mode, binary or text?
  o Connect and login to the FTP server, which can result in:
    o Success
    o Login failed
    o Too many users
      o Sleep, retry until ...
    o Timeout
      o Sleep, retry until ...
  o Actually upload the file, which can result in:
    o Success
    o Permission denied error
    o Out-of-space error
      o Sleep, retry until ... ?
    o Server too busy 
      o Sleep, retry until ...
    o Timeout
      o Sleep, retry until ...
    o Wrong transfer mode (active/passive)
      o Reconfigure and try again
  o Configured to verify upload?
    o No
    o Yes
      o Check file existence and size (that's about all you get w/FTP)
        o File is there and correct size
        o File isn't there
        o File size is wrong
          o How do you handle file size changes in text mode?
        o Listing is denied
        o Timeout
  o Archive local file afterwards?
    o No
    o Yes
    o ... (All the stuff that can go wrong with just mv'ing a file)
  o Delete local file afterwards?
    o No
    o Yes
    o ... (All the stuff that can go wrong with rm'ing a file)
  o Produce an execution report
  o Produce an error report, if any
  o Produce a trace report, if enabled
  o Route reports to correct people

It took me twenty minutes or so just to write this summary; it'd take me
about two to four hours to code it, more to test, then integrate into
larger framework.  And then there's designing the framework,
implementing FTP GET, SFTP GET, SFTP PUT, ...

And why do you have to be anal about handling every error as much as
possible, by retrying, etc., instead of just aborting and throwing up a
message?  Because you have hundreds of such jobs and putting out that
many fires gets tiresome really fast.

And then there are other things that are maybe outside the core module,
like looking at audit logs and producing reports, or verifying that a
particular job ran within the allowed time periods (it's not unusual
that there will be files that come or are sent certain times of the
month or quarter or year, that could arrive within some particular delta
of time, but need to have arrived within it).

You see now why _managing_ lots of transfers for _unattended_ operation
is non-trivial?

I don't know how many systems you've managed at one time, but you can
start out crafting each installation for the particular need, being
absolutely parsimonious with disk space used, using scp in "for" loops
in the shell to keep critical files in sync (maybe you even write a
wrapper script or shell function), but at some point you realize that
you could spend more time reading Slashdot and ranting on the PLUG list
if you invested some time up front in automating the OS installation and
learning and using a tool like cfengine to everything in sync.  This is
analogous to that.

Keith weighs in, again:

VOLTMETER, not ammeter.  Voltmeters measures voltage in volts, ammeters
measure current in amps.  There are ways you could use an ammeter, but
they are too complicated to get into here.  Ammeters are designed to
pass current with very low voltage drop, and will conduct a hell of a
lot of current when subjected to many volts.  AC adapters are supposed to
limit the current, but the current limit circuit can fail.  An ammeter
shorted across an AC adapter could blow up the adapter, the ammeter,
or both.   You might as well test the adapter with a hammer: "it might
have been broken before, but it is definitely broken now!"

The difference between current and voltage is like the difference
between salary and education.   One is a flow, the other a potential.

And I agree with others - testing with a tongue could be lethal, because
there could be leakage in the AC adapter.  There is not supposed to be,
but electrocution is a lethal way to find out.  9V batteries do not have
line cords so they won't kill you through your tongue (though you can
still damage something).

The mouth is not an electrical measurement device, it is a beer 
processing device.  Don't use it to measure voltage (or current),
and your voltmeter won't drink your beer.

I'm trying to educate myself on how the physical memory in my

used.  It has 128 meg of RAM and is running a 2.4 kernel.  I'd like to
know how the 128M is allocated: how many pages by each process, within
the process how many are used to map libraries into memory, etc.

I'm happy to hack something into the proc filesystem if I have to but
it seems somebody must have done this before.  Any ideas or pointers?

Thanks,

   Ouch! I don't have spare parts for your PDA, but I have two Handspring
Visor Pros with cracked glass, thanks to being dropped. Sigh.

I am about ready to get rid of my Handpring Prisim (once I get a
smartphone), should I give you buz Richard when I am ready to get rid
of my Handspring?  The LCD is perfect, the plastic around the LCD is
cracked though (caused I dropped it).

   That would be nice. If I could create a working unit from the carcasses of
two or three, I'll have a spare for when a replacement is again needed.

Thank you,

   Has anyone else found problems -- blank page contents -- when printing

   In Opera-9.0, I can print these same pages, but this tool is configured to

How does "Print Preview" look when you try to print the page(s)?  Also, 
have you tried ticking the checkbox to print to a file and seeing how 
the Postscript output looks?  Depending on the site, it could be an 
issue with Firefox's ability to render the page properly for printing 
because of the use of layers, or perhaps even bad AJAX/javascript code. 
  Other times, but unlikely, it could be set to print just a single 
frame and that frame could be empty.

Daniel,

   I've not used print preview before. Interesting. Just tried it on Google
news, and only the images show up, no text.

   The big concern this morning was printing out a trip itinerary from the
airline's web site. The "printer friendly" page displayed correctly, but
only the box outlines actually printed.

> Also, have you tried ticking the checkbox to print to a file and seeing

   This is how I've almost always printed. I don't keep the printer turned on
unless I need it. Most of the pages I want to keep are printed to .ps files,
then run through the ps2pdf filter.

Why would you want to know how the memory is physically laid out unless 
you're planning on modifying memory management within the kernel itself; 
different versions of the kernel may handle memory layouts completely 
differently.  If you want to know how much memory is being used for 
shared libraries and how much for each individual application, look into 
the 'top' program as Rich suggested.

You can get a mapping of the memory used by an individual application in 
the /proc/[pid]/maps file.  This includes all the shared libraries used 
by the application, memory allocated for heaps and stacks.  Some 
information about maps file syntax can be found at:
http://www.linuxforums.org/misc/understanding_/proc_3.html

I don't know of any applications that produce a visual (graphical-based) 
description of how memory is allocated.  It doesn't seem like it would 
very difficult to implement based on the maps files, but the image 
manipulation libraries you'd need for common image formats probably 
wouldn't be on your router. You could use the XBM image file format 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBM) without any libraries using just 
about any scripting language, even bash, due to its simplicity.

Also note, the maps files would not contain information such as files 
that are cached in memory, buffers, kernel modules or the kernel itself; 
I don't see any easy way of extracting this information without using 
/dev/mem or /proc/kcore and manually parsing the raw memory.

Some URLs of pages that are acting up for you would be very useful to 
help determine whether it's because of dynamic content, layering or 
something else.  Regardless though, it may be worth joining and querying 
with a/the Firefox mailing list or searching their bug reports; they 
can't fix print rendering problems they don't know about.

Daniel,

   Just for giggles, I'll start a list. They all seem to have javascript
content when I look at the page source.

   Good idea. Any in particular of which you know?

   Thanks, Larry. I'll build and upgrade this weekend. They're certainly
rolling out the upgrades on a very short schedule.

Oops...XBM format is monochrome.  Sorry, I meant XPM 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPM_%28image_format%29); got things 
confused.  There may be other easy to use image formats but I don't know

The Mozilla development forums can be found at:
http://www.mozilla.org/community/developer-forums.html

You might actually try joining their IRC channel first; information is 
at the very bottom of the page.  They might be able to provide some more 
insight into your problems there and/or tell you the next steps to take 
to report your bugs.  I'm not sure which mailing lists are best to join, 
but I think IRC is a good starting point.

You could also try searching Mozilla's Bugzilla itself for 'javascript', 
'print', etc:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/

I'm looking for something more accurate.  And as I read more, I'm
finding out that the information may not be there.

For example, multiple threads show up as different processes though
their resident sets are shared and so to the extent they're mapped
into memory it's to the same pages.  So if I use top, or
/proc/<pid>/maps, I need to weed out duplicates (and am not sure how.)

I found a patch producing a proc fs entry called /proc/memmap that
produces output with one bit per page of physical memory, either free
or in use.  And I'm following the data structures for in-use pages
hoping they'll point to the processes that own them.  That's the kind
of information I'm hoping for -- and so far I'm not getting too far,
but also reading that it may just not be there.

I'm just curious, so not knowing won't kill me. :-)

Thanks for the suggestions,

Subject: [PLUG] creating a bootable FreeDOS USB flash drive
Message-ID: <20060804223722.DFA838F0D@tinman.seitzassoc.com>


I recently needed to RUN some DOS-only tools(BIOS upgrade, etc.) on a
system without a floppy.  This forced me to figure out how to run
FreeDOS from my flash drive.  There are instructions on the net for
this, but they weren't completely clear from my perspective.  Perhaps
these notes will be useful to others.

Steps for creating a bootable FreeDOS on a USB Flash drive that is
already FAT formatted.  Note that these instructions apply to USB drives
that look like hard disks(ie they contain a partition table), and not to
drives that are set up as super floppies.

NOTE #2  BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU HAVE SCSI DISKS.  The fact that SCSI and
USB use similar device names could really spoil your day.


1. Make sure USB drive is not mounted.

2. Save the 1000 sectors or so.  This should be large enough to include the
   first sector of the first partition.  Alternatively you could determine
   the first sector of the first partition and save everything up to and
   including that sector.  The LBA address of the first sector of each
   partition is in the partition table.

     dd if=/dev/sdX of=saved_sectors count=1000

3. If the USB drive lacks a valid master boot record(MBR), install one.
   This can be done using the install-mbr command on Debian systems.  My
   Redhat systems don't have this command, and I'm not sure what the
   alternatives are.  My USB drive already had an MBR.

4. Mark the partition as bootable using fdisk or similar.

5. Install syslinux.  This copies ldlinux.sys to the filesystem and writes
   to the partition boot sector.

     syslinux -s /dev/sdX1 

6. Mount the USB drive.

7. Copy memdisk to the USB drive.  This allows syslinux to boot from a
   floppy disk image.

     cp /usr/lib/syslinux/memdisk /USB_drive_mount_point

8. Copy a FreeDOS floppy image to the USB drive.  I found a suitable one 
   here:
     http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/old/beta9sr1/disksets/ODIN/fdodin91.img

     cp fdodin91.img /USB_drive_mount_point

9. Create a syslinux.cfg file on the USB drive that contains the following
   lines:

     default freedos
     prompt 1
     label freedos
     kernel memdisk
     append initrd=fdodin91.img


That's it.  After booting from the drive, A: is a ramdisk version of the
freedos image file.  Any writes to A: will be lost on a reboot.  C: is
the filesystem on the USB drive.

galen,

   Very interesting, and useful to upgrade firmware (e.g., on a printer) when
the upgrade is available only as a Microsoft file.

   What flash drive looks like a hard drive rather than a floppy drive, and
has an MBR already installed?

I'm getting the feeling that you're speaking from first-hand experience here.

Mel,

   I filed a bug report on bugzilla.mozilla.org. It was moved from firefox to
printing.core, then assigned to someone.

   Rod asked if I had a proxy running, because that might be involved. I do
have privoxy-3.0.3 running here, but opera is configured to use it, too, and
pages that won't print from firefox do print from opera.

   Thank you for confirming that it's not just me. It's easy to become
paranoid and think it's something I did here that no one else in the world
can duplicate.

Rich

lilo -M /dev/sdX

- or -

grub-install /dev/sdX --root-directory=/mnt/<mount_name>

But then you have to followup with LILO or Grub.

I suspect most larger(> 128, 256?) flash drives look like hard disks.  I'm
using a sandisk cruzer mini 512 MB.  The MBR was present, and it was set up
with a single partition, but it wasn't marked as bootable.

The story is too long to be told here, but suffice it to say that 
overwriting boot sectors in the early morning hours before catching 
a flight is not recommended.

Subject: [PLUG] rebuilding your network after a crash... literally!
Message-ID: <86fygbu2kj.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


Here is a moderately amusing story that occurred today.  Some of you
may be aware of the neighborhood-wide wireless network that Personal
Telco Project built (and continues to build) on North Mississippi
Avenue.  This morning, I checked the cacti graphs for the network and
noticed downage.  It was strange.  It was strange because different
nodes disappeared at different times.  The "total associations" graph
pretty much lawn-darted at about 3:15 or 3:30 this morning.  It wasn't
like any of the typical outages we've seen, where someone unplugs
something, a flakey cat5 connector gets bumped, a neighborhood-wide
power outage, etc.  

Hmm, I thought.  I'll need to get over there ASAP to figure out what
is going on.  I have the only PTP key with access to the building
where we bring in the DSL.  I stew a little.

A little while later, I check my email and find a message from the
building manager.  He reports in three terse sentences, that: someone
got on the roof last night and *threw* our gear off onto the sidewalk;
the police arrested the guy (who was drunk); and could we please call
to help figure out how to fix it!

Oh.  Shit.

Our gear there consists of non-penetrating "tripods", which are held
down with cinderblocks, with a vertical mast about 4-feet tall, to
which we have attached an additional 6 foot mast (with some overlap),
to which is attached our radio gear and antennas.  Each of the radios
are connected to the building via a length of UV-rated cat5 (power is
supplied over the unused pairs of the cat5 [1]).

I call and get a few more details.  There are three tripods, all three
went over the side.

Building manager tells me two of the masts are damaged.  The other one
got held up by a tree and was dangling from the cat5 until morning
(this explains the non-simultaneous failures).  The perp had
(thankfully) removed the cinderblocks from the tripod before hurling
it over.  Of course, with the cinderblocks it weighed about 400 lbs.
The cinderblocks stayed on the roof.  The building manager (and,
later, Don Park) took some photos of the carnage [2].

So, I rustle up some helpers and head over.  Don and I arrive first.
I find two of the masts sitting inside partially recombobulated.  One
of the radio enclosures has some damage (broke off the polycarbonate
mounting bolts at one end, and a small crack at the top.  Just the
small crack penetrates to the weatherproof section.  Don starts
opening up the boxes with a screwdriver, while I run home to get some
power supplies to fire up the radios to see if they still work, and
some rope with which to haul the gear back up onto the roof.

It's about 1pm when I get back, Don has the boxes open.  In the
cracked-case box, the board is loose.  The four plastic standoffs
that hold the single-board computer inside either broke or pulled
out.  I find one that isn't damaged and hang the board from it.  One
of the mini-PCI radios is slightly ajar in its socket.  We reseat the
radio.  We apply power, to each of these two, and happily they still
function.  We identify which one goes where, and start hauling the
gear outside to where we can rope-lift it up the side of the building.

Meanwhile, Caleb Phillips and Michael Weinberg let me know they are on
their way to help.  Don and I get the masts up on the roof.  When
Caleb arrives, a little after 2pm, he and Don carefully pull up the
tripods. 

In the process we discover one of the sector antennas we are using for
local coverage was also damaged.  A couple-inch long hole was broken
in the polycarbonate radome.  It doesn't rattle, but peaking through
the opening it appears the antenna elements might be damaged.

I run off to get a spare replacement antenna from my house and a
replacement bolt from the hardware store for one that got munged in
the fall.  By the time I get back, they have finished determining that
the cat5 runs are still okay, but they've fried my cat5 tester in the
process.  Well, two leds of my cat5 tester.  The leds didn't like the
48V supplied by the PoE.  Oops.

The only remaining problem is disassembling and reassembling the
Amphenol IP67 weatherproof ethernet plugs [3] on a newly crimped tip.
There is a special tool to do the disassembly, but small screwdrivers
and similar devices work also, with persistance.

That solved, we plug in the devices again, a little electrical tape to
temporarily patch the radio enclosure crack, and bingo, back online.
Total downtime, about 13 hours.

The only remaining questions are:  

  a) Why did the perp do it?  Was it just random drunken exhuberance,
     and a crime of opportunity?  Or did he have something in for PTP?

and

  b) Can we recruit this guy?  He's obviously not scared of climbing
     on roofs.  PTP needs people like that, we just need to curb his
     caber tossing[4] impulses a bit.

oh, and maybe:

  c) is this what I get for asking questions of last night's PLUG
     speaker regarding backhoes (or equivalent) taking out his fiber
     runs?

Don't be surprised if the SBC or radio fails at some point in the
future.  After a fall like that, the circuit board traces and
connections could have hairline cracks.  A little expansion and
contraction due to temperature swings may cause a trace to fail.  Of
course you probably knew that.

   Are any of you using a small drawing tablet that works on a linux box? I
understand that some should work, but I don't know if there's a "linux
drawing tablets" compendium.

If you can run the long smart test and comes back with no
errors, then you just had a few bad spots on the drive.
The problem with un-correctable errors is that the firmware of
modern drives won't re-allocate un-recoverable sectors, it
requires manual intervention.

smartd drive status should report good, then your ok.
A few bad sectors don't qualify as a dying drive.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0608070814300.27979@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Yesterday I tried to finesse an annoying gtk+2 bug that displays the
calendar incorrectly in jpilot. This problem appears with the version of
gtk+2 I had installed, but not with earlier ones.

   So, I spent ... er, wasted, too much time trying to build the latest
gtk+2. That involved building upgrades of atk, pango, and cairo, too. To
make a long story short, I could not build pango with cairo, and gtk wants
that. Also, there are apparently serious bugs in gtk+2-2.10.1 so I really
didn't want to try that for my calendar display problem in any case.

   The result is that my system was FUBAR this morning. I got X11 running
again, and also fixed the problem that kept gnucash from loading and
running. But, my mission-critical jpilot is still AWOL. When I try to invoke
it from the command line I see:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ jpilot
removing stale pidfile
*** glibc detected *** free(): invalid pointer: 0x0810b2e8 ***
Aborted

   To which I respond, "huh?" Of course glibc is present, and it's the same
one that's been here since the distribution upgrade. I also re-installed
jpilot from the original (freshly downloaded) package, but that didn't
change the situation.

   I don't understand what the error message is telling me. There's nothing
in /var/log/messages. I cannot find where the pidfile was.

   Your collective wisdom and focused insight is greatly appreciated in
helping me get this application running again.

TIA,

Rich

that message indicates that a subcomponent of glibc detected badness, and the 
program that was trying to execute this badness was trying to free memory that 
it didn't own (invalid pointer).

That's a huge bug in either jpilot or any of the libraries that jpilot uses 
(gtk+-2 etc). it should be reported upstream, and perhaps already has been.

unfortunately I fear that downgrading gtk+-2 is your best option. Gtk+ seems 
to be very unstable the last period, and many non-backwards-compatible changes 
have gone in recently, driving some of my fellow coders insane. 2.6 or 2.8 
seem a better choice. Perhaps it helps...

Auke

So, not to diminish all of your good work here, but did you consider
just booting the FreeDOS image directly from GRUB?  I just recently
realized I could boot lots of things from GRUB that I hadn't thought
of--particularly the kernel and initrd from an installer (because not
all of my NICs have PXE support [that works reliably], many have neither
floppy nor CD-ROM).

Anyone here familiar with it?  I got tipped onto it via the backupPC-users
mailing list.

Apparently, you can only bare metal recover Windows with it if you have a 
Linux system on the machine.

Another suggestion I got from that list is DriveImage XML, apparently XP
has the ability to let you image your system drive while you are running.
Okay, I trust this not.  This option looks like it requires a WinPE boot
cdrom, so I'm thinking license headaches.

I want to boot the system recovery OS over network, strange that these two 
bare metal recovery tools aren't designed with that in mind.  Boot from cd 
means you have to find the cd and have a cdrom drive in every computer you 
want to bare metal recover.  Ick!

Not that I've ever gotten a rsync setup working, but how with the rsync 
approach do you avoid backing up corrupted files?  Sure rsync can help
you back up just what has changed, but those changes are not necessarily 
good ones.

<Aside>
Since XP Home seems to slow down until it dies after Microsoft updates 
are applied to it, are there any third party upgrades that actually
improve XP security and performance?  Is Microsoft seriously going to 
force consumers to purchase a service to get Vista running?  Isn't
XP phoning home bad enough?
</Aside>

Auke,

   Yeah, I got that. Why, when I dropped back to previous versions and the
error still occured, is beyone my ken.

   There's the rub. The same jpilot-0.99.8 has been running here since last
November without a problem. Heck, I've never before had _any_ problem with
jpilot. I re-installed the Freerock Gnome (to get gnucash running again),
and that put gtk+2-2.8.12 back on the box.

   Neither of these caused any problems before I dug the hole into which I
fell.

   Any other thoughts or magic incantations that might help? :-)

No, I hadn't considered GRUB.  I assumed that it needed to reside in
an ext2/3 filesystem.  If it can live on a FAT filesystem, I'll have
to give it a try.

  It depends on which machine I use.  My Linux boxen has trouble
burning FC5 CD's that will pass the installation check.  My Linux and
XP laptops both produce FC5 CD's without a problem.

  I suspect the CD writer in the first box is bad.  It reads CD's and
DVD's OK, but appears to have a problem writing.  I'm going to replace
the drive one of these days.

All of mine have passed the media tests.

What brand of media are you using? What speed are you burning at?  What 
brand of burner?

well, if you run `ldd /usr/bin/jpilot` you'd probably see it pull in about 200 
libraries. My guess is that some gtk+ related library is mucking about too, 
and glib-2 comes to mind immediately. Other than putting traps and debugging 
the whole thing, I would see if downgrading that helps. You should have at 
least the same glib2 version as the gtk+-2 version installed.

Well, I think GRUB will work on a FAT filesystem, but that's not really
the point--the point is that the existing GRUB on your HD (assuming, of
course, you're using GRUB and not LILO) can boot the image directly.
Hm, well, now that I think about it, I think you'll still need memdisk
from syslinux.  Something like this in your /boot/grub/menu.lst, after
coyping memdisk and your FreeDOS floppy image to /boot:

title FreeDOS boot
  kernel /memdisk 
  initrd /freedos.img

Not being one to recommend things I cannot try too easily, I just did it
and it works.  My point, here, is to try to avoid booting off USB, which
too often doesn't on my lousy old hardware.

Have not had an issue here, burned both the orig FC5 and
the latest spin. The latest spin is DVD only.

Did you do an MD5 check before burning ?

Subject: [PLUG] centos4.3 rpmbuild not working as normal user
Message-ID: <20060807170332.6FBDE8F0D@tinman.seitzassoc.com>


In the past I have been able to build rpm packages on my CentOS 4.3
(x86_64) system as a normal user, but something has broken.  Now the
prep and build stages seem to be NOPs, causing the install stage to
complain about missing files.

I'm using the cdecl source rpm as distributed by CentOS for testing.
This is a small and presumably known-good package.

Any ideas what might be wrong?

Check the permissions on your build tree. Also check your .rpmmacros file 
and make sure everything is defined correctly.

Auke,

   It's no where near 200 libraries, but there are about 50. It's finding
glib-2, which does not track the gtk+2 version numbers. glib2-2.8.6 from the
freerock gnome project is installed, and jpilot is finding that library
without difficulties. Running ldd shows nothing unresolved.

   This is a particularly frustrating error to find and fix as I've not had
problems with jpilot since Judd first released it a number of years ago. I'm
sure it will turn out to be some simple missing package, but I've no idea
which one.

   I've asked for ideas on the jpilot mail list, too.

Many thanks,

Rich

Do you still have /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.92486 lying around your filesystem? 
If so, do the contents look like the script that produced the 
root-invoked output:

The files in /var/tmp are being removed and I don't know how to prevent
that.

I have.  Well maybe I didn't check the last -- Rescue.

Twice in fact.  Forgot where I put ( to whom I loaned ) the first set.

The only times I've had problems with downloaded images was when I *had* 
to use a Windows system to ftp them and the connection was slow-ish.

I don't think rpmbuild provides an option for keeping temp files. What 
I've typically done is pressed Ctrl-c shortly after the temp script 
begins its execution run. The temp file won't be cleaned up if 
rpmbuild is killed that way.

I temporarily gave write permission to other for ~/rpm/*, but it
didn't help.

Okay, I caught it with a Ctrl-c.  I had to change to a full build in order
to catch it.  So the tmp file is empty.  That would explain the failure,
but now why is the file empty?

I'm guessing you tried 'df /var/tmp'?  Also, I think if you put 'exit 1'
in the appropriate section the tmp file will not be removed (not
verifying this time :)

Doh!!!  Thank you!  I recently caught up on a bunch of CentOS updates.
I thought maybe one of the new packages had broken something, but it was
just that the yum cache filled /var.

Windows FTP clients will sometimes default to ASCII instead of binary. 
That introduces all sorts of corruption into the iso.

Always check the md5sum or sha1sum results after download.

Actually you can.  Look at the man page for rpmbuild.  You can 
short-circuit it anywhere you want along the process.

Honestly, I would much rather put the money I would spend on the warranty
into a decent investment when I buy the laptop.  I do this for three
reasons:
1. Depreciation - By the time the manufacturers warranty is up often times
the computer is worth about the same or just slightly more than the amount
spent for the extedded warranty.
2. If I get a lemon laptop that keeps requiring repairs, use the money I put
aside to buy a different brand or model of laptop, extedded manufacturer
warranties effectively lock you into that model of laptop.
3. None of the money is getting wasted to pay people who's job it is to find
some reason the repair isn't covered.
4. The money can be used to replace the battery
5. I can use the money in the investment to upgrade to a new laptop if I
don't use it for repairs.

Like you said the warranty is a bet.  Just like in Vegas the companies
offering the warranty have done the math and made sure they will on average
make more money off of you than they pay out.

So some of the reserved filesystem blocks were used when root ran the 
rpm process, resulting in a normal rpm-tmp file in /var/tmp, but your 
normal user account saw 0 free blocks.

That's a good symptom set to tuck away in the ol' gray matter. :-)

Oh, in case someone doesn't know -- most Unix filesystems will reserve 
a certain percentage of blocks purely for root's use, just for this 
sort of case when a filesystem fills up. By default, ext2 and ext3 
reserve 5% of the filesystem blocks for root, though on quite large 
filesystems I usually reduce that to 2%.

You can see your current settings using tune2fs:

  tune2fs -l /dev/hda1 | grep -i 'block count'

Using tune2fs, you can also adjust the percentage of reserved 
filesystem blocks.

None of which helps you if you drop it, it gets knocked off a table or 
someone pours Mike's Hard lemonade into the keyboard.

The warrenty I have covers all of the above.  And even after 2 years, it 
is still a pretty fast laptop.  (HP zv5000z.  AMD64 3700+ with an nVIDIA 
440 go chipset and a 1920x1200 resolution screen.)

Warrenties do not just cover defects, they cover accidents as well. (At 
least the good ones do...)

The trick is in how they cover the warranty expenses.

I've heard from fairly reliable sources that of the types of insurance 
carried by most people -- life, health, homeowners, and auto -- only 
auto policies are able to create profits on their own. The others are 
all break-even or losing propositions.

Companies that offer those types of policies are often little more 
than brokerage houses -- using premiums as cash flow to fund their 
investment portfolios.

With laptops and warranties, the question becomes, do laptop 
manufacturers fund warranty work strictly from warranty fees or do 
they underwrite part of the warranty expenses by building some extra 
cost into all machines.

I can imagine the logic working this way:

 * people who buy laptops are not cheapskates

 * people who buy warranties are not cheapskates

 * people who buy warranties are risk-adverse and likely to stick
   with a brand that works rather than buying from this month's
   lowest-price vendor

 * it's worth encouraging a longer term relationship with these
   folks, since there's a reasonable chance that this type of
   person *wants* to be a repeat customer and avoid changing
   vendors

 * let's underwrite part of the warranty costs with a mild price
   bump on all laptops

The corporation loses only if a huge percentage of customers purchase 
warranties. It actually makes more money if fewer customers do, since 
everyone is paying part of that cost anyway.

There is nothing wrong with companies making money, IF they provide
value.  Keep in mind that part of their warranty calculation involves
keeping you as a customer rather than losing you to the competition
(worth $), and part of it involves stocking spares, keeping technicians
trained, etc.  The high prices charged for out-of-warranty repairs are
indicative of the high costs associated with unpredictable repair
demands.  It is a bet, but it is not Las Vegas, more like commodities
futures.  A warranty provides assurance to both parties.

In my case, I started with a very good laptop (a Thinkpad T30) with 
features I like a lot (trackpoint, decent speed, good quality).  It
is not a "lemon" per se, but it has needed quite a few repairs, mostly
due to getting a LOT of use.  I prefer its feature set to many of the
follow-on models,  and migrating to a new laptop ranges from annoying
to painful.  The relatively high price for used T30s on Ebay, years
after they stopped making them, indicates that others think the T30
is a good machine, too.  I'd buy a new one if they still made them.

Junking 2 year old laptops is not virtuous - if the hardware still
meets the need, it should be maintained.  So, assuming that I keep
it (earning 2x its depreciated market price per week), and that it
will need repairs from time to time,  what is the best way to do so? 
Warranty is a bargain, for me and for the manufacturer.  

Yes, there are bad warranties out there.  The IBM->Levono->Selectron
warranty is trending towards suckiness (and many manufacturers have
outsourced their repair to Selectron).  I am considering alternatives,
but I still may buy Levono next time, if that turns out to be the best
warranty available.  I consider a good warranty an important product
feature, and an comprehensive warranty indicates the manufacturer's
confidence in the quality of their product.  

You say bad warranty service is not worth it - I agree.  But that
does not mean that good warranty service is also worthless.  If you
have ever had excellent repair service, such as I have had in the 
past from IBM for my laptops, or in other domains (for cars from
State Farm / Heitzmann, for example), you would be less enamored
of the "disposable crap" approach to life.  There are still people
that take pride in quality, and I enjoy basking in their sunshine.

  We bought top-of-the-line warranties on a couple of Dell laptops a
few years ago.  They saved our butts.  One laptop just had bad luck.
It had a bad motherboard within the first couple of months.  The
screen went bad a few months later.  Dell fixed both problems without
complaint.

  Our CEO is *real* tough on laptops.  The second laptop has been
completely replaced (one part at a time) a couple of times over.  Dell
even replaced the broken plastic case after he drove off with the
laptop on top of his car.  Dell Support never had one word of
complaint.

  The Dell Customer Call Center in India was next to useless.  The
only way to get service was to stay "on script".  On *their* script.
Strange things could happen when you went "off script".  We finally
got decent service when they switched us to the "corporate" support
line down in TX.

I have used a 'live' image tool a couple times on XP as a last resort 
and had no problems both times.    As far as WinPE is concerned, use 
BartPE.  It's legal to use and shouldn't be the cause of any licensing 
obstacles.

Is this a reliability issue?  How often does this happen to you?  BartPE 
can be put on a thumb drive too.  I've found that maintaining current 
and properly prep'd Windows installation media is better than keeping 
system images in many cases.  But I'm not aware of your exact need.

Enabling the XP firewall and installing and setting Mozilla as the 
default browser as well as one of the popular free AV software packages 
works well enough.

Where did you read getting Vista running will require the purchase of a 
service?  Again, not the case.

Having the media checks fail is a pretty common problem.  There is a
long-standing bug in the Linux kernel where it miscalculates the
length of CD and this results in read errors or the wrong checksum.
Normal reading from the CD is okay.

One solution is to pass ide=dma as kernel option.

Exactly, warranties have to be evaluated for what you are getting out of
them.  Many times people buy warranties and insurance based on feelings
(usually fear) instead of taking the time to evaluate the risk/rewards of
the warranty.

Generally I think warranties make more sense on expensive laptops than on
cheaper ones.  However, it is really important to consider what isn't
covered by the warranty.  If you have a manufacturer warranty of 1 year and
your visa card doubles it to 2 years, what will the covered part of your
computer be worth?  I.E. replacement cost minus the cost of the battery and
any other non-warranty covered components.

Example:
$1000 Laptop with one year manufacturer warranty.  With a 3 year extended
warranty for $300.

If the laptop totally failed after that 2 years and you had the 3 year
extended warranty.  You would receive a refurbished laptop which has 1 year
of warranty coverage remaining and have a useless laptop battery that cost
$100+ that needs to be replaced.  While the laptop is being repaired, you
don't have a replacement.  You can also potentially run into other issues
with the laptop that aren't covered in the fine print.

Purchase the same laptop with a Visa card that doubles the manufacturer
warranty.  The laptop has warranty coverage for 2 years.   At no additional
cost.

Invest the $300 you would have spent on the extended warranty after 2 years
you would have anywhere from $310-$380 depending on how it's invested.   For
which you buy a new laptop with similar specs to the one that failed which
after 2 years is about half the original cost and has a good battery and
once again you have 2 years of warranty coverage.  Out of pocket cost
$120-$200 (not much more than the cost of a replacement battery).

Which is the better deal?  The second option has a bit more potential out of
pocket cost worst case, but if the laptop doesn't fail you still have your
money.  If it fails after 3 years, you still have your money, if it fails
after 5 years you still have the money.  If you want to run a new
application that requires a faster laptop, you can sell the old one on ebay
and use the money set aside for repairs as part of the purchase price on
another laptop.  And if you use the money you invested to purchase another
laptop, it has the manufacturer's warranty again.  Obviously for a more
expensive laptop the warranty might be a better deal, but then that isn't
necessarily so.

Rich,

I should have posted something.  I not only enjoyed it, but sent it 
along to a few others.  One of the others liked it so well, that he made 
this to send along to his Micro$soft dependant friends.

No, people would raise all kinds of hell if I allowed stuff like that

Or send it to me directly and I'll put it somewhere.

Bruce Kilpatrick wanted to send a picture to the list - the list
does not accept attachments.  The best way to send along a picture,
a program, a computer virus, etc. is to put it up on a website
somewhere and then post the link.

Someday, PLUG will have a wiki.  Until then, I maintain a few wikis
which permit page attachments, and I can provide access to people
I know.  Contact me off the list.

Have you tried Cat5e jacks?  I just wired an entire building with Cat6 
and used the 5e jacks (they sent the wrong jacks in the shipment).  Even 
though Cat6 wire is thicker I had no trouble.  AFAIK, the only part of 
the jack that makes it Cat6 is the larger diameter holes, and the way 
the holes are offset to make them still fit in that small space.  I 
believe Fry's does have Cat6 jacks but I am unsure of brand and you will 
pay dearly there.

I finally got hold of someone at Fry's, but I am not sure he gave me
correct information. He did confirm that they had Cat5e and Cat6, but
only in packs of 5 for the Cat6 ($16.99) and 10 for the Cat5e ($29.99).
In other words, for quantity ten, the Cat6 are $34 and the Cat5e are
$30. That's not a huge difference.

On eBay I can get a bag of 50 Cat6 for $97 with free shipping. It's
just that my wiring project needs them *now*. (I thought I had bought
them already, so here I sit unable to finish until I get them.) I can
also get Cat5e on eBay for far less. I thought of doing what you did --
use Cat6 cable (which I have already bought), and Cat5e jacks. After
all, the bandwidth I have today isn't going to come close to taxing
even Cat5e. If somewhere in the future I need full Cat6 bandwidth, I
can just replace the jacks.

However, the dude at Fry's said that the Cat5e are Leviton and the Cat6
are not -- although he couldn't tell the brand name. Then he said that
"Keystone" and "Leviton" are not interchangeable. That is, you can't
use a Keystone jack in a Leviton wall plate and vice-versa. That's the
part that sounds bogus to me. I have already bought the plates, and
they are Leviton. And I have *one* Cat6 jack that I got at Fry's, and
it fits the Leviton plate just fine. I think he was making stuff up. 

I guess tomorrow I'll call ENU, Norvac and other local suspects to see
what I can turn up.

My experience is a couple of years old, but...

I bought Leviton Cat5e jacks at Home Depot. I don't know it they had 
Cat6 or not. Lowes probably has similar stuff.

What about your project requires Cat6? From my days in the office at 
Electrical Construction Company's Voice & Data division, I know that 
there is a significant difference between each of the levels, but only 
if you are trying to work at the extremes of performance. My 
recollections are rusty, but as I recall, Cat5 was good enough for 10Mb, 
Cat5e for 100Mb, and Cat6 for Gigabit speeds. Around the house, I get by 
fine with 10Mb. I can see where some folks might want 100Mb around the 
house, but I suspect Gigabit within the house would be more than most 
folks require. Then, again, I'm not trying to push a lot of video over 
my Intranet.

Home Depot and Lowes have only Cat5e. And their prices are the highest
in town. Plus, I'm not sure it's a good idea to buy computer stuff from
a lumber yard.

You are absolutely correct. I do not need Cat6.

[Ahem] years ago a computer salesperson, in attempting to sell me an
IBM clone for $1499, far less than IBM wanted for their version,
informed me that it was the last computer I would ever need to buy.
That was, he assured me, because it would be impossible in one man's
lifetime to fill up its state-of-the-art 5 MB hard drive.

A speed of 100 Mb is more than adequate today. But ten years from now,
after the internet matter transporter is invented, it will never do.
That is, unless you want it to take all day to download a cup of coffee
from the ethernet-ready coffee maker in your kitchen.

Cat5e will do 1000Base-T (ie Gigbit) 100mhz
Cat6 is speced to 250mhz so it could do 2-4 Gigibit fibre channel over copper

Both of need to be of runs less than 90meters to run speced speed.
There is a Cat6a which is rated to do 10Gb.

I'm wanting to say Cat3 is sufficient for 10mb, but I'll be safe and say
Cat4 is sufficient for 10mb. Cat5 will do 100mb, in short runs might
handle 1000mb, but isn't supposed to. Cat5e will do 10gb over a pair of
cables (very short, perhaps 3-6 meters _officially_).

Nothing to my knowledge requires Cat6. In fact I'm not entirely sure
there is an official specification for Cat6. Failing that cabling labeled
"Category 6" was out well before any specification was.

If you don't believe me, I'll just need to grab whichever expert is handy
for an authoritative source (though Google might be faster).

Get real!  You won't want to have strung your house with fiber in ten 
years?  Sure, Cat6 is good for five, but will be totally out of style 
by then.

It's absolutely required.  Who in their right mind would wire a building 
with old tech?  It's not easy to replace this stuff when the dry rock is 
up and the paint is on.  I get into this with low volt guys all the 
time.  People should use what's "current" in cases like this. Gb over 
copper won't last forever.  It's going to find it's limit in some new 
application that will require higher speeds that Cat5e won't do.

The Cat6 specification *is* has been done for some time.

Ah fudge.  You said "jacks" and I thought "plug".  It was the plugs I 
had in Cat5e, the jacks were Cat6.  Anyway, I still don't think it 
matters.  This is the last inch we're talking about here.  The secret 
sauce of Cat6 is in the cable itself.  Tighter twists at varying 
frequency and slightly larger diameter in the copper.  None of that 
exists in any jacks anyway, so I wouldn't worry about replacing them in 
the future.  You might be able to get a low volt guy out with a tester 
that supports bandwidth testing.  It will tell you what your lines will run.

Here's what I would do.  Look up Home Automation installers or Low 
voltage electrical contractors.  They may carry this stuff in stock. 
I'm buddies with the owner of an electrical contractor who like Leviton. 
  I will give him a call tomorrow and see if there is a local pickup for 
Leviton stuff in the area.

I might have a few extra left I could sell you, but not 30.  I would 
have to go out to the building I did and look in the big box-o-extra 
parts.  They are Leviton.

The lowest cost places I know of for bulk networking supplies
(including Cat6) are:

1) Pat Heiden's PCH Cables, http://www.pchcables.com/keystonejacks.html
in Hillsboro.  Pat buys stuff off the boat from China.

2) Norvac in Beaverton, http://www.norvac.net/, no online parts catalog.
More expensive but located a bit closer to you.

Home Depot has all sorts of assorted networking supplies of that sort. 
I did not look at the pricing because I am avoiding thinking about 
rewiring until I finish unpacking.

Thanks to all for the suggestions. 

First, Graybar has three brands, including an ample supply in one brand
of the color I want (ivory) in stock, but of the three brands the
cheapest price is $5.58 each, for quantity 30.

Norvac has none in stock, takes seven to ten working days to order, and
wants $4.30 each, just in case I'm willing to sit around and wait.

PC Heidens is too far. Fry's, "the store you love to hate," seemed the
best choice. So this morning I drove 30 miles down to Fry's, cursing
George Bush and his oil friends every expensive mile of the way.

When I got there I discovered that they had only 15 in stock. I put
them in my shopping basket anyway. I also needed some blank fillers,
but all they had was one package of white ones. Oh well. Those are not
urgent. I can get them later elsewhere.

And I also needed more cable. Previously I had bought 100 m of Cat6
cable from Fry's but, after reconsidering my networking requirements, I
had decided I needed another 300 feet or so. I searched everywhere in
the networking area, but all they had was boxes of 1,000 feet. From
last night online I knew that the same cable I had bought before was
available on outpost.com. I asked employees where it might be, but all
I could get was a shrug of the shoulders. "Might there be more in the
back," I asked. This elicited the standard employee answer "all we have
is out on display." This from an employee standing next to the entrance
to the back stock area where additional boxes of cabling were plainly
visible. OK, I know his job is to get rid of me so he can go back to
chatting with the other employees, but you'd think he could be more
creative. I might have even accepted the brush-off gracefully if it had
been artfully contrived. Really, these people need some new lines.

I decided to give up on the floor staff and go to the checkout counter.
Perhaps they have access to a computer with a searchable inventory
list. (Why doesn't that lady who tells you which checker is free have a
clacker like the ladies in front of the elevators used to have at
downtown Meier and Frank -- "third floor, ladies apparel, bagatelle"?
She totally needs a clacker. "Checker #17 is free <clack>.")

I got to the checkout counter and asked the person behind the cash
register if she could check to see if they had Cat6 cable in stock,
other than in spools of 1,000 feet. Her response was "huh?" OK, her job
description is to scan the barcode and enter the numbers manually if it
won't scan. Other problems she is to refer to a supervisor. She
discharged the latter duty and a supervisor showed up. I repeated the
question, pointing out that it was on outlook.com, and could they
please check their inventory in the computer database. It took 10
minutes, but she finally succeded in verifying that they had 23 boxes
of 1,000 feet of cable, but none of smaller quantities. Then she
assured me, sotto voce, as though it were a state secret, that
outpost.com has nothing to do with Fry's.

For some reason that did it. My annoyance escalated to a high level of
pissedoffitude. "Fine," I said. "It appears I am going to have to go to
PC Heidens to get the cable I need. Since their prices on everything
else I have in the basket here are a bit lower, I won't be needing any
of the rest of these things." Whereupon I turned and walked out. <Note
to self: You really need to develop that haughty twist and turn of the
head for scenes like this. Check out queenie gay flics.>

On the way out the door it occurred to me that I had never been to PC
Heidens in Hillsboro. "No problem," I thought. "I'll just look them up
in that funny phone book that I keep in the car." But that was not to
be. They are not listed in the Verizon Portland area phone book. OK,
back into the store. Walking up to the greeter, I asked if there was a
Portland phone book around. "Portland phone book?" she inquired "Sonny,
you're in Wilsonville." OK, she didn't say "sonny," but that was her
intent. I could tell from the prosody of the sentence. I'm a
linguistics major.

After a few minutes trying to figure out how to divine the location of
PC Heidens without a computer, a phone book, or a phone number, I gave
up. I decided to visit that great Thriftway in the shopping area next
to Fry's. They have a very nice wine section, where I found a bottle of
Chaucer's Mead. OK, Chaucer died 700 years ago, so I doubt this is his
personal production. Nevertheless, it is a fitting reminder for History
of English spring term, and will make a nice end to an otherwise
fruitless, annoying and exasperating day.

----

Back home, it is 4:30 and there is still time to call surplusdepot.com
and order 30 Cat6 keystone jacks for $2.22 each. I do so, and they will
be here Tuesday. The network wiring will have to wait. I totally hate
it when my plans get derailed, but sometimes we must become
philosophical. The wiring this week was not meant to be. In the
meantime, the Attitude Adjustment Hour is upon us. Nobody needs an
attitude adjustment more than me. Time for that bottle of mead. :)

The thing about Fry's is, you only go there if you have no other 
alternative.  Once that is firmly in your head, the attitude (aptitude?) 
of most of the employees there is working against you.  Get in, get out.

I've had to go to that store on numerous occasions and not a single time 
can I remember anyone asking me for help.  And back where the hard 
drives are they have that little podium where one person sits like 
they're on a freaking throne and refuses to do anything for you to help 
outside of delegating you to the next available floor jocky.  They will 
sit there and do nothing right in front of you without making any eye 
contact that might sow a seed of guilt for being like they are.  I've 
waited for 10 minutes for a floor guy to ask me for help, only to turn 
around and check inventory on the computer right next to 
said-king-on-throne and give me my pick up slip.  I honestly can't 
understand these people.  Is it the Fry's management that searches these 
people out?  Or is this just what happens to you when work there for 
more than a day?

Last night Keith Loftstrom and I gave a lot of greif to Chris 'podcast yr meeting'
Dawson about buying a microphone from Fry's.  Among other rethoric we stated
"Fry's is the WalMart of electronics."  I'd argue there is always an alternative. 
The Portland area is rich with locally owned vendors.  If you have to send your
money out of the area by spending it at a chain the Internet offers a much more
efficient mechanism.

It's a winnowing process.  Only the truly dull and demented can survive in that
environment.

That's my experience most times I go to Fry's.  Yes, the majority of
times I go there, I spend two hours being frustrated and then buy
nothing.  I think they're a sophisticated Slack-stealing operation
cleverly disguised as an electronics store.

Wow,

I am glad to know it is not just me.  Walking into that place sets me on 
edge, and, like most of you, they usually don't have what I drove all 
that way for.  Find some help...surely you jest.

When the bimbo at the check out counter asks me, "Did you find 
everything okay?"

My reply about the lack of sales help is usually ignored...go figure!

A couple of years ago, I showed moral failure and went to Fry's for
a laptop drive.  The lowest price was on outpost.com, the price was
decent at Enu, and the shelf price at Wilsonville Fry's was the
highest.  I pointed out the ad in Computer Bits to the felon\\\\\
sales associate at the Drive Altar, who proceeded to the runaround.
"Why don't we call them and verify that price?" sez he, and starts
a phone call to Enu.  At the time, it took Enu about 5 minutes to
answer the phone, and he gave up after 30 seconds.  "Too bad" sez
he, "Nobody there".  I did the John-like scowl and basket abandonment
maneuver, and burned some dinosaurs up to Hillsboro.  I didn't go
back to Fry's for a year.  While moral weakness has taken hold
again (I stop by when in Wilsonville for other reasons), it did
cost them business.

Note to John:  there is often a Portland phone book near the pay
phone by the bathrooms at Fry's.  Also, 411 on the cell phone.
And here's the info for PCH Cables (www.pchcables.com):

Monday thru Friday 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM  / (503) 629-3200 
2020 NW Aloclek Drive, Suite 107 (On Cornelius Pass Road), Hillsboro
It is closer to Portland than Wilsonville is, and Enu is nearby
for other computer gizzies.  

UPS ground takes one day from Hillsboro to Beaverton, and I have done
that a couple of times when I was willing to wait.

And finally, this is a chance to get misty eyed and remember our
dear departed fiend\\\\\friend Gary Groesshoeme of Oregon Electronics,
which was located at NE 9th and Davis and had all sorts of adapters
and cabling and jacks at pretty decent prices.  He did not have rock
bottom prices, but he was always good for half an hour of good advice
and great conversation - worth a little extra.  We miss you, Gary!

I found this to offer excellent advice, and $10 isn't a bad price:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0376018062/ (Sunset books "Wiring
Home Networks")

Below is a nice complement to the above which gives more technical
detail on the wiring itself, and it's free:

On checking of sources, looks like Cat3 will do 10mbps just fine. Also
looks like the Cat5 limit is 1000mbps, though you need Cat5e for 10gbps.

You're assuming that the future is low-voltage cable. There is a pretty
good chance it will be fiber. The price differential is small enough that
Cat6 is likely a decent investment. Note that I didn't say not to use
Cat6, I merely stated nothing uses it yet. The investment only works out
only if we continue with copper, a pretty fair risk, yet the price is
still small.

Pat Heiden has moved on to another venture: PCH Cables (which is a
fantastic store, BTW). What remained of PC Heidens became Iguana

You might want to figure out which .pc file pkg-config is finding and
look at it.  One possibility is that you have two versions installed
and it isn't finding the newer one's .pc file. This is quite possible
if you are using a different prefix. The PKG_CONFIG_SEARCH_PATH
controls the search path.  Another is that the new version wasn't
installed properly and didn't install its .pc file.

The --debug option spits out lots of debugging info.

Please send me a link for this info.  I was unaware of any documentation

I don't think Fiber is the (short distance) future for a while yet.  The 
cost is far more than going from 5e to 6.  I would have used Cat7 in my 
last wiring project had it been easy to get the parts.  Cat7 is what is 
officially takes copper to 10Gbs.  Cat5e and 6 are both rated for 1Gbs, 
though Cat6 has better qualities in S/N ration and NeXT.

When Fiber gets cheaper, and consumer products using it are 
(foreseeably) readily available, then it will be good for consideration.

Don't let us scare you.  It's not that difficult.  I recommend Cat6, but 
even if you use Cat5e it's still all hooked up the same.  Find a good 
central location for a switch, and as much as possible from there run a 
drop out to each location you have a computer/peripheral.  Think home 
run wiring.  Sometimes a second switch may be more convenient than 
making to runs to a location.

If this is new construction, and you're into gadgets and all this tech 
stuff, I would run Cat6 to every location in the house that may have a 
major appliance, phone, video/tv, and security camera.  Blanket the 
place in copper. :)

An additional problem with fiber is it's extremely difficult to splice. But 
that's doubtless as solvable as bringing the cost down.

I considered fiber, but then I decided that Cat6 would hold me for at
least five years, probably ten. That is, barring the invention of some
incredible new technology that requires greater bandwidth.

So what will become of my Cat6 inside the walls in ten years? Well, I
am thinking that by then wireless will have advanced greater than Cat6
can currently provide. And hopefully the security issues with wireless
will be adequately addressed as well. This is all gross speculation,
but I think when the time comes that my Cat6 will no longer provide
what I need, I'll move to whatever wireless technology is available
then. And if that is inadequate, then it's time for surface wiring. Or
I'll just tear the sheetrock off the walls, do it over, and put up new
sheetrock. In fact, all the holes I made in the studs are very large,
so I could probably just use the Cat6 to pull new fiber in. Or
whatever. Or I'll be dead. In fact, just finishing this wiring project
may kill me.

I don't fasten wire to anything if I don't have to.  It help for just 
that purpose.  Another thing you can do is when you run wire, leave 
sections of the pull string in the walls.  That way you can use the 
string to pull more wire (and more pull string for the next time) though 
without using the old wire to do it.  In case you don't want to remove 
the old wire when running new that it.

Does WIRELESS  mean anything to anybody???

Why drag wire if you DON'T need to???

Because it's the only way to make full use of anything faster than

i'm going to be rewiring a old but now minus all its sheetrock house
later this year. for LV i'm thinking about running flexible ENT conduit
to many of the destinations. The ENT may run into wireways that
then end into a small room dedicated to utilities.

checkout http://www.carlon.com/brochures/2f58.pdf

on those holes, be careful not too big

The diameter of drilled holes in studs should not exceed 40 percent of the
stud depth, and the minimum edge distance to the boundary of the hole shall
not be less than 5/8-inch. When studs are doubled, drilled holes should not
exceed 60 percent of the stud depth. Holes of maximum diameter should not
occur in more than two consecutive studs. Adjacent holes, or holes and
notches
should not occur in the same cross section. As an example, a 2x4 can have
a maximum hole of 1 3/8-inch or 2 inches if studs are doubled.

Get yourself a bit of real-world wireless experience. You won't look at any of 
those links in the same way again. :)

It's all very relative. Wireless (and by that I mean 802.11a/b/g) is
inarguably slower than fast/gigabit Ethernet. It will never be as
secure (regardless of any software-based security measures are used),
and in many environments the reliability (connection quality) is
spotty.

Bear in mind that many of us use our home networks for far more than
simply accessing the Internet.

Well, he said he was wiring so I assume the reasons why had already been 
thought of on his part.  I have wireless at home and I will give you a 
few areas it sucks in:

   - My 2.4GHz cordless phone get major static if I'm using the Wi-Fi
   - When the microwave is on my wireless is often weak or unavailable

In my house, these two things happen often enough when I am using my 
wireless in some way to make it really inconvenient.

The next phone I buy will be a 5GHz phone, just so I can get away from 
the 2.4GHz band.  Yes, I have tried different channels.  The next time I 
am in the market for a microwave I will do a little research and see 
what can be done there as well.  Maybe mine is leaky, or maybe there is 
nothing you can do about that in particular.

I saw your comment to Paul and as for the 'unreliable' issue, with what 
I outlined above, sorry.  Not much you can do when those sorts of things 
pop up.  You just deal with it.

At the recent Blackhat conference, Johnny Cache claimed a new exploit of 
a common wireless driver flaw.  Although the demo showed rooting a Mac, 
he said he'd found the same flaw in some Windows drivers.

Extra specialness of this hack: it doesn't require you to even have an 
active connection running on your wireless card, only that the card is on.

As if that helps against unknown exploits...

If you really want to protect against unknown exploits, I suggest using a 
pair of wire cutters to sever all network cables, followed by embedding 
the system in a combination of concrete, thermite and magnesium.

It is the only way to be sure.

Back at the turn of the century (I can say that now, can't I?), the 
toughest part about fiber was the terminations. At EC we had just a few 
of the techs who could do it, and only one who specialized in it. The 
trick was to polish the glass the right way. They use a puck that looks 
something like a checker game piece with a short rigid tube to hold the 
fiber perpendicular to the very fine emery cloth that was sitting on a 
very flat piece of thick glass. They did something of a figure-8 pattern 
as they polished. It seems like a straight forward task, but the 
"perpendicular" to "very flat" parts were critical for it to work well. 
I'm assuming that the objective is to get the two pieces of fiber to be 
parallel to each other so that refraction is minimized.

They also kept a package of band-aids (TM) on hand. Fiber is glass, and 
apparently, it was not uncommon for them to poke themselves with a sharp 
edge of a broken fiber.

   That's what happened, Ian. I knew nothing about pkg-config before this

One place I don't see mentioned here is Home Depot. Yes, they have a few 
networking parts. Including keystone ports, plates, and blanks.

However, if I have the time, nothing beats mail order. I shop online for 
lots of things. I do a lot of business with Computer Network Accessories 
in Ohio. For the keystone jacks you are talking about, it's $3.25 each, 
or $2.95 if you buy 5 or more.

I put 30 of them in my cart, and came up with the following (ground 
shipping to a business address):

Purchase price:	$88.50
Shipping: 	 $8.07 	
Total:		$96.57

2nd day air was $19.95, so even that's not too bad.

I do shop local when I can, but damnit, I work hard for the money I 
have, and have to scrutinize each purchase... Otherwise, there's not 
enough to go around.

We weren't talking about absolute security (the fairy-tale), or security 
against someone that has physical access to the computer and/or network 
(a very very difficult problem as implied above).

We were talking about wireless vs wired, i.e., we'd already decided to 
network.  All other things being equal, I say:

[OS/net weakness]   <   ( [OS/net weakness] + [wireless weakness] )

Is it worth it to use wireless when there isn't any convenient 
alternative?  That's a completely different question.

I ended up getting them for $2.22 each, plus $6.99 shipping from
California. Will be here Tuesday.

I'm not cheap, I merely optimize price:performance on my transactions.

Message-ID: <20060813110346.GA20223@gate.kl-ic.com>


My sister's Win98 machine finally died of virus infestation and
partial hard drive failure.  I was not able to talk her into a
Linux box, but I did talk her into a Mac Mini, which at least I
can maintain remotely, and can be fixed up for proper backups.

I was able to recover her Outlook .dbx files from her damaged hard
drive.  Googling reveals som open source programs for converting 
.dbx files to open formats,  but as usual I expect most of them are
poorly written alpha software, with one or two good ones. 

What Outlook converter is good, and runs on either the Mac Mini or
on Linux?

An important distinction, that's Outlook Express, not Outlook.  It would 
make a difference in your search results.  Thunderbird imports Outlook 
Express, and I would imagine the Mac software would as well as OE was 
made for Apple too.

I've never seen anyone get "burned" by Lite-On, and the price is right!
I have one myself.  It worked in 2.4, it works in 2.6, and I expect it
will keep working for a long time to come.  I've had other, cheaper
burners that worked in 2.4 SCSI emulation mode, but failed to work in
2.6 IDE mode.

Subject: [PLUG] Apache and mod_perl configuration
Message-ID: <44E21D98.6080906@acm.org>

My adventure has me at "wit's end" ( whit's end?  Been too many years. )

I'm working on a application that use Catalyst and it is set up to use 
mod_perl.

The problem I've run into is I can't get past mod_perl when accessing 
static files ... *.js *.css with out placing the whole path in the XHTML.

For those not familiar with Catalyst the standard 
installation/configuration places javascript, css, and ( static ) html 
files directories in [/var/www/]root/static/.

The only way I've been able to get to them is to use the full path from 
DocumentRoot.

DocumentRoot is set to /var/www/root/

But even with Aliases I have to use /static/css/site.css or 
/static/js/site.js

I've tried reordering the declaration in httpd.conf, going from 
<Directory> to <Location>, with and without trailing slashes; finally 
arriving at wit's end.  ( The dragon looks pretty simple right now. )

All the documentation I've found for mod_perl helps with over-riding the 
Apache default handlers but nothing on circumventing mod_perl -- which 
is suppose to be the "default" behavior.  Go figure, eh?

Any suggestions, examples, clue-sticks?


Thanks,
Rod

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0608151409540.16187@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   On my main workstation/server (running Slackware-10.2 with the 2.4.32
kernel), many pages will not print from firefox-1.5.0.x. I upgraded this
morning to -1.5.0.6 and cleared out all other firefox binaries and
libraries. The problem remains. I've posted here before on this topic.

   However, when I try firefox on my notebook (currently -1.5.0.4), the same
pages that produce no text on the workstation print just fine (using print
preview to save time and energy in both cases).

   Opera-9.x prints these pages on the workstation/server that firefox won't.

   My question is: how can I systematically check to learn what broke firefox
printing on the one machine? Other than some applications I run on the big
box but not on the notebook, they are synchronized in kernel and GNU
utilities.

   I am not sufficiently clever to know where to start looking for the source
of the problem. Most of you are many times more clever than I on these
issues and can undoubtedly lead me by the hand to the solution.

TIA,

Rich

Now you understand the problems with using a distro that doesn't have
package management.

Have you tried printing the same pages as a different (ideally,
brand-new) user on the problematic box?  If you run Gnome or Kde I
would suggest trying with the other, or some other WM. running.  I've
found that gnome often puts it's fingers in places they most certainly
don't belong (eg: hibernation stopped working on my thinkpad when I
went back to fvwm.) It's possible that there is some weird layer
between firefox and the printer driver that is broken due to some
other strange problem.

It could (possibly) be a firefox plugin that has gone haywire, perhaps
not updating correctly because of some minute version difference on
one system that wasn't present on the other.

When faced with weird problems like this, one of the first things to
do is to determine if it is a problem with the system, or a problem
with your settings, and the easiest way to do that is by creating a
new user for testing purposes.  Hopefully the new user doesn't have
any problems, in which case you can move your dot-files over to the
new dir. one at a time until the problem arises again, at which point
you can figure out how to fix it.

Rogan,

   I've used only Xfce on my systems. Haven't created another user and tried
from that account.

  I should also mention (because I forgot in the original
post) that invoking firefox with the -safe-mode option makes no difference.
So, it's not an extension or theme causing the problem.

   OK. I'll work my way through this.

   Guess that's why I'm not a SysAdmin, Wil. When I go to the firefox web
site it identifies my need as linux in English. I've never seen a package up
there, not Fedora, Red Hat, Debian, Slackware, Gentoo, Ubuntu, or any other.
It's a gzipped tar that needs no configuration, making, or installing other
than untarring in the directory of our choice.

   How would a package management distribution prevent this problem?

Roderick,

Is the reason that you can access some static files because you have 
your server set up to intercept all requests within certain directories 
to be processed by mod_perl or such?

You might like to have a look into Catalyst::Plugin::Static::Simple to 
see if it will fix your problems:

How many years have you been denying that, Rich?  You've got to admit
that to yourself; you've been doing it for a long time now.  Admitting
it is the first step to alt.sysadmin.recovery :)

The difference is that you don't do it often enough to have gotten sick
of doing the manual stuff over and over again and realized that
sometimes you should trade off control for certain worries.  That
encapsulates my opinion of Slackware pretty well--but it's not just
Slackware, I used to worry and fiddle with an installation to keep the
size down as small as possible, to tweak and tune and fiddle bits here
and there.  Nowadays, I could mostly care less.  I'd rather work within
the constraints of the system and focus my time where I get either the
least work down with the most accomplishment, or the most fun.  I mean,
if doing stuff manually is your thing, and you've got the time, then by
all means, love yourself all over it.  But it doesn't sound like you do.

I've only ever downloaded Firefox from mozilla.org for Windows
installations; for Linux installations, I used the included binary (or
one from an established 3rd party), built for my particular system.  The
problem that people complain about with Linux systems is the diversity
of environments; with a huge application like Firefox that depends so
deeply on many parts of the system, it's particularly bad.

>    How would a package management distribution prevent this problem?

 o If you think you've missed uninstalling something, package management
would have let you know that you'd completely uninstalled it.

 o If you installed things with library version dependencies that got
mangled (which it sounds like it has), package management would have
made it harder for you to shoot yourself in that particular foot.

 o Most of the distros with package management would also have provided
you a binary, the right libraries, etc.

Rogan,

   Not a brand new user, but another user. It's the same issue.

Wil,

   I don't use Slackware for control, but for stability 'way back from the
bleeding edge.

   I've not been a twiddler and tweaker, but a learner. When I learned enough
to know how to do the things I wanted, I simplified my network and settled
back to use the system as a means to an end, not an end in itself. Other
than security upgrades to the system, and certain security or bug fixes to
the applications I use daily, I don't futz with the system until I get a new
distribution set in the mail. It takes me perhaps an hour to upgrade all
three hosts here, and I'm done with system administration other than
checking the log summaries mailed to me each morning and changing the backup
tapes on Friday and Monday.

   I don't know why you think I do things manually. The Slackware package
tools (installpkg, upgradepkg, removepkg) make distribution and application
upgrades much less of a hassle than I had with Red Hat.

   Well, the problem also occurs with packages created specifically for
Slackware. The same package won't properly print on the one box, but will on
another. What that has to do with the distribution I don't know.

   I know full well that you've a ton of experience. When three systems are
running the same distribution and the same versions of everything, but one
has a problem with one application that is not a problem on the other hosts,
I fail to see how it's the result of my choice of a linux distribution.

Rich,

You could have at least one backend library that Firefox uses that could 
be different versions, or at least compiled against different versions. 
  It could be anything in a printing library or even a rendering one. 
Use the 'ldd' command on the firefox binary (firefox-bin) to get a list 
of libraries it depends on and then check those library version numbers 
between the systems.  Please note that most of the versions listed by 
ldd are symlinks so you should not use those numbers, just get the names 
of the libraries.  Also note that some libraries depend on other 
libraries and so on.  Some libraries linked against my version of 
firefox that seem likely causes include, but not limited to (from most 
likely to least):
- libcairo
- libpangocairo
- libpango
- libgdk_pixbuf
- libgdk-x11
- libpangoft2
- libgtk-x11

Cheers,

Daniel Hedlund

Daniel,

   I'll work my way throught these. I know that trying to upgrade wxGTK lead
me to trying to upgrade gtk+2, and that depends on cairo, pango, pangocairo
and all the rest. It was a real mess, and I finally went back to what I had
before. But, that was last weekend and the firefox preceeded that by some
months.

   When I'm done I'll report what I find.

Many thanks,

Rich

So, would this problem qualify as "internal bleeding" ;) ?  (sorry,
couldn't resist.)

Re: the other user test, I'd still suggest a brand-spanking new one,
but I'm not that worked up over it ;).

I don't know slack very well, so I can't help much.  Maybe some one
here would have an idea if you could post some of the links that fail
to print.  There could be a weird technology at work that is known to
cause problems or something. (I'm shooting in the dark here, so I'll
shut up.)

Daniel,

   Well, for a start, some libraries are missing. Running 'ldd
/usr/lib/firefox/firefox-bin' produced a long list. All were resolved to the
appropriate libraries except for these:

 	libxpcom.so => not found
 	libplds4.so => not found
 	libplds4.so => not found
 	libplds4.so => not found
 	libplds4.so => not found
 	libplds4.so => not found
 	libplds4.so => not found
 	libplds4.so => not found
 	libxpcom.so => not found
 	libplds4.so => not found

   All right, already! I got it that libplds4.so isn't on the system. Neither
is libxpcom.so. So, my first task is to find in which package those are
located and install them.

   One of these days I may actually remember on my own to try 'ldd.'

Thanks,

Rich

Debian Stable is infamous for how far back from the bleeding edge it stays.

Scientific Linux (re-worked RedHat) is used by research labs and offers
stability and backwards compatibility.

Two alternatives that meet your requirement from the top of my head.

It appears that most of the libraries you are missing (libplds4.so) are 
part of the nspr (Netscape Portable Runtime) library:
"NSPR provides platform independence for non-GUI operating system
facilities. These facilities include threads, thread synchronization,
normal file and network I/O, interval timing and calendar time, basic
memory management (malloc and free) and shared library linking."
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/nspr/

The libxpcom.so library should be in Firefox's directory 
(/usr/lib/firefox-1.5.0.x/libxpcom.so) for me.  Because it's in the same 
directory as the binary, it is detected by firefox-bin when started.

   Turns out that these are both installed here, in both /usr/lib/firefox and
/usr/lib. However, the latter were broken soft links.

   I fixed that up, so 'ldd /usr/lib/firefox/firefox-bin' shows no missing or
unresolved libraries. But, the printing problem remains.

   We seem to be eliminating possibilties, and fixing broken links along the
way. I look forward to your next suggestion for me to check out.

Many thanks,

I think Wil and Michael's points are best taken now.  If you had broken 
softlinks, your package management system is failing you.

You could go around hunting these little problems for ages and you will to 
get this little printing problem resolved.  And then you can go around 
hunting a new set of problems when you encounter the next error...

Or you could go to a systemic fix.  Debian Stable does seem to be exactly 
what you need.

/usr/bin/firefox is usually a shell script that sets up LD_LIBRARY_PATH
to include /usr/lib/firefox; if that didn't work, you've know a lot
sooner because it wouldn't start at all.

Go to a website this is not printing properly using your laptop (which 
does print), save the complete web page to disk ("Web Page, complete"). 
  Take that page and the subdirectory it creates to your desktop 
computer and see if it prints.  This way you can at least have a static 
page for reference (?).

Once you do that, you might be able to find someone else with a copy of 
Slackware with the same or similar version installed and get them to try 
to print it to see if the problem is reproducible on another Slackware 
install.  This might help to eliminate that it's just a fluke with your 
one desktop install.

I agree with this, especially about the binary not loading if there are 
any missing libraries.  I'm not personally concerned with Rich having 
any missing libraries, but rather the versions of his libraries being 
used might not be in sync; his printing problems could be because of a 
simple/trivial bug in a library somewhere.  One thing Rich could/should 
also take into account is modifications made by the "firefox" shell 
script that adds to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  This can modify the libraries 
that Firefox uses as compared to the results that 'ldd' returns.  The 
script could be overriding system libraries or the other way around.

Playing around with the firefox script, I have noticed that firefox 
seems to be executed not necessarily just by "firefox-bin", but also by 
"mozilla-xremote-client".

Rich, try running the following (assuming you are using Bash):

MOZILLA_DIST_BIN="<path_to_firefox_lib_dir>"

if [ "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" ]
then
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MOZ_DIST_BIN:$MOZ_DIST_BIN/plugins:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
else
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MOZ_DIST_BIN:$MOZ_DIST_BIN/plugins
fi

This should act like the shell script (since I took it from there) and 
resolve all the libraries the same way as the firefox binary.  From a 
realistic point of view, I don't think this will lead to a result that 
will fix your problem since you have identical versions of the firefox 
binary and libraries.  The libraries overridden by firefox will probably 
be the same.

I think it's important to just stick with what you're comfortable with 
and what works.  The question itself is very vague and I hope it doesn't 
turn into a discussion about which email server is the best.  I don't 
see the Sendmail community completely dieing out anytime soon, so as 
long as you're comfortable [with security and other related issues], 
just pick the tool that is right for the job and has the features you're 
looking for.  If you're lacking a feature or feel uncomfortable with a 
particular product, please let us know so we can make recommendations 
based on that.

Also, doesn't the Debian community officially prefer Exim[4] now?  I 
think that's the default email server under Debian.  Does anybody know 
any other distributions that also choose Exim as their default?

Is the IDE hard disk set to master?  Also, I've had some problems with 
cheap USB attached storage enclosures on some VIA chipsets that just 
would identify themselves properly; when it did get recognised, it would 
randomly lock up after a period of time (after transferring about 30MB 
or so).  This only happened on certain computers.

Check '/var/log/messages' for any errors that might be reported by the 
kernel when you plug in the external drive.

Also, with this static website loaded on both browsers, try printing to 
file (postscript) with the same printer driver.  You (or someone who 
knows a little about the postscript file format) might be able to use 
the differences between the printer output to determine how far into the 
rendering/printing stage things made it before things started going 
funny; there might be some signs of an attempt to start rendering the 
page but it stopped a few lines in for example, or possibly corrupt 
postscript data.  This is unlikely, but at least you might be able to 
find out if Firefox at least attempted to generate valid content within 
the postscript document.

If you do a "man firefox", it also appears that there are some GTK 
options you can pass to Firefox to enable some debugging output.  If you 
  can figure out the options to pass, you might be able to produce some 
debugging output that could reveal your problem or differences between 
the inner workings of the two Firefox installations.

Then why are you installing Firefox?  Netscape 4.78 was rock-solid.
(Okay, it wasn't.)

If Slackware isn't providing you with Firefox updates, then how stable
can it be?  Firefox is one of your core tools--and a common one at that.
It's like saying a particular car is rock-solid but you have to supply
your own transmission.

That's now how it looks on this side of the mailing list.  Let's see, in
the past few weeks you've:
 o Had a /usr/lib/ with broken symlinks to NSPR libraries
 o Had a Firefox that wouldn't print certain pages
 o Had a broken pkg-config for glib (probably caused by an incomplete 
   attempt at manual installation w/gtk+)
 o Had jpilot crashing with an invalid pointer to free()
 o Attempted to rebuild and install gtk+, atk, pango, cairo, which you 
   then had to (manually) uninstall
 o Had jpilot not displaying the calendar correctly
 o Which seems to have been caused by a prior attempt to manually 
   build  and install gtk+
 o Had GPG break mysteriously by installing the package from some 
   other site on the net
 
That's a lot of problems for a stable system that you don't twiddle or
tweak.

You do realize that second-level-version upgrades to libraries like
glib, gtk+, atk, pango, etc. are the kind of things that only get
upgraded on major releases, even on a bleeding-edge distro like Fedora,
because everything that links to them should be relinked.

Wrappers around 'tar'.  The reason you had hassles with Red Hat was
because it was enforcing dependency tracking, which exists to prevent
exactly the kind of problems you're having now.  You can't list the
files a particular package owns, find the dependencies of a package,
find what packages depend on a package, verify that all the files are
installed and are correct checksums, etc.

Then they're badly packaged or badly built?  As I said before, a core
application like Firefox should be supported out of the box in a desktop
distro.

There's no way to know what's different between these supposedly
identical systems because you don't have package management.  Well,
that's not /entirely/ true--you can do it the brute-force method--use
'find' to create a list of every file on the system,
pruning /home, /var, maybe others, and then diff them.

Subject: [PLUG] flash plugin and sound
Message-ID: <44E281D1.7030200@digitree.org>

I have a simple script that I use to enable and disable the flash plugin 
for Firefox that I normally keep as "~/bin/flash".  Unfortunately the 
script isn't perfect and there are a few things I'd like to improve upon:
- if you have sound playing when the flash plugin is first used on a web 
page, you no longer have any sound support in flash until after you've 
completely restarted Firefox.
- when you disable the plugin, you have to restart Firefox for the 
changes to take effect.  Enabling flash while the web browser is open is 
okay and changes take effect immediately.

What I'd like to do is to find some way to unload or replace the flash 
plugin with an empty/shell plugin to cause it unload without restarting 
Firefox.  This is becoming a huge pain for me in that I am almost always 
listening to music using rhythmbox or mplayer while browsing the web. 
Fairly often I like to listen to streaming music (radio, GarageBand.com, 
CDBaby.com, etc) and would simply like to stop rhythmbox and hit 'play' 
within the flash plugin.  I have even reverted to such tactics as 
loading Firefox as another user using sudo so I don't have to restart my 
Firefox client with 20+ pages open.  I think the problem is mostly 
because flash doesn't use alsa and thus doesn't allow mixing?

Any ideas, solutions or success stories?  For anyone interested in 
enabling/disabling the flash plugin, my script is as follows:

#!/bin/bash

display_usage() {
     echo "USAGE: $0 [ --enable | --disable ]"
     echo
}

if [ ! $# -eq 1 ]; then
     display_usage && exit 1
fi

if [ $1 = "--enable" ]; then
     echo "enabling flash..."
     chmod 644 ~/.mozilla/plugins/flashplayer.xpt
     chmod 755 ~/.mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so

elif [ $1 = "--disable" ]; then
     echo "disabling flash..."
     chmod 000 ~/.mozilla/plugins/{flashplayer.xpt,libflashplayer.so}

elif [ $1 = "--help" ]; then
     display_usage && exit 0

else
     display_usage && exit 1
fi

Yes and no. Folks using Postfix or Qmail, aren't actually using Sendmail,
but they're almost certainly using the Milter interface. Everyone copied
the interface for Spam filtering.

Yes, and I sure as heck wish the Exim disaster wasn't the preference.
Using the package install scripts, all the other MTAs are similarly
simple to setup in simple installations. For complex installations Exim
isn't suitable, so why bother?

Further, during the Exim 3 days, they were making Sendmail look like Fort
Knox. I was glad to avoid needing security patches several times a month.
Further, Exim doesn't support support the username+tag syntax; the big 3
all support it, and this is very helpful for filtering.

Rich,

With all these sysadmins telling you that you are a sysadmin and just
recently trying to help you with your problem, you must be even more
frustrated than usual.

I am just wondering if your font server is setup properly on the
misbehaving box.  Maybe you are not serving all the fonts the pages
need.  Check into xfs, chkfontpath, etc.

I feel that if Rich didn't have the font server running, he probably 
wouldn't be able to get into X.  If he could, I think it would become 
quickly noticeable through his general use of various applications. 
Also, if he didn't have the correct fonts installed, I'm sure he'd 
notice visually within Firefox long before printing; there are also 
normally default fall-back fonts used when others can't be found...and 
they're pretty awful looking.

Thanks for the suggestion though; it's worth taking everything into 
consideration.

Cheers,

Just a super wild-ass guess from someone who knows little. In the world
of IDE, hard drives expect to be the master, and are shipped from the
factory with that setting. CD drives, on the other hand, expect to be
the slave. And that's about all I ever cared to know about master-slave
relatiionships.

The master/slave setting is just another way of saying device 0 or 1. 
You cannot have two slaves or two masters on a single ribbon.  Sometimes 
there are performance reasons for having devices set as a master or a 
slave, but it won't prevent anything from working.  This has nothing to 
do with USB enclosures though.

I would imagine the drive needs to be set as a master in this case 
though, but it's not something I've ever experimented with.  The 
enclosures I have had were always master and I just left them that way.

I've fixed my problem relating to sound in flash when sound is being 
used by another application.  The solution was to install the 'alsa-oss' 
library and then use the 'aoss' wrapper program around Firefox, i.e. 
'aoss firefox'.  This solution seems to work well for me and even allows 
Firefox to play sounds at the same time as another application.  This 
solution may also fix some other sound problems related to flash (sound 
lagging while playing videos), but I haven't tested this thoroughly yet.

A walkthrough for Debian and Ubuntu can be found at:
http://planet-geek.com/archives/003048.html

For Fedora/Redhat-based users, you'll need to manually download an 
alsa-oss RPM from a 3rd party website and then run the 'aoss ...' 
command above; it doesn't appear to be in any common 2nd/3rd party 
repositories used with Fedora though.  CCRMA seems to be the preferred 
download site by posters on other mailing lists.

Fedora Core 5:
http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/mirror/fedora/linux/planetcore/5/i386/alsa-oss-1.0.11-1.rhfc5.ccrma.i386.rpm

Fedora Core 4:
http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/mirror/fedora/linux/planetcore/4/i386/alsa-oss-1.0.9-1.rhfc4.ccrma.i386.rpm

Fedora Core 3:
http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/mirror/fedora/linux/planetcore/3/i386/alsa-oss-1.0.9-0.1.rc1.rhfc3.ccrma.i386.rpm

...

I am not sure the steps required to get flash's sound working properly 
under other Linux distributions since I don't have them installed.

I still have not yet come up with a solution to dynamically unload flash 
from Firefox while it's still running, but I did talk with someone who 
gave a suggestion of modifying mime-types dynamically within Firefox to 
prevent new Flash applets from using the library.  I have not yet tested 
this idea and whether or not it can be triggered by a shell script.

Based on my experiences with the Flash plugin and various idiosyncrasies 
between different distros/platforms, I have created a project that I've 
dubbed 'flashlight'.  It's basically the script I provided a couple 
emails ago on steroids with several new features added.  I do realize 
that Flash 9 will be coming out sometime next year, but there's still 
some time to go before then.

'flashlight' is a tool which helps user to install and manage the 
Macromedia Flash plugin on Linux-based operating systems. flashlight can 
be used to download and install flash, correct alsa/oss sound-related 
issues, fix distribution-specific bugs, and enable or disable flash on a 
per-user basis.

The flashlight project page can be found at:
http://projects.digitree.org/flashlight/

If anyone is interested in helping me to develop this further, please 
contact me off list.

Cheers,

   Thank you, Daniel. And your assumption that it would make no difference is
borne out by a trial.

   Since this is a problem on one of three hosts running the same
distribution and versions of the application, I need to find some
firefox-specific help. I'll go looking for the appropriate forum for that.

It was.  Turns out it was a <Location /> where it 
should-have-been/needs-to-be <Directory /> for the Documentroot ( and 
Catalyst ).

I'm still playing with the Apache configuration and looking at how the 
Catalyst development server will work when I change the templates ( with 
the XHTML ) to not have the /static/ in their paths.  My reading last 
night lead me to believe that Catalyst::Plugin::Static::Simple will 
solve that problem.


Thanks,
Rod

By Humphrey Cheung
August 7, 2006

Las Vegas (NV) - The great need for qualified computer security personnel is
now forcing the government to rethink rigid hiring guidelines. At the Defcon
computer security convention in Las Vegas, more than a dozen federal agents
told attendees that traditional requirements like college degrees and
polygraph tests were no longer strictly required for government employment.
They also said security clearances are being approved quickly.

In a rather surprising change of strategy, the government is streamlining
its process of attracting hacking talent. Jerry Dixon, deputy director for
the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, told journalists that
his organization has hired several people without degrees. Jim Christy,
director of the Defense Cyber Crime Institute told attendees that most of
the people who come to work for him usually come in as contractors and have
no background with the government. "We're gonna teach you how to do the
job... without college degrees," Christy said.

Apparently, "very gifted" have the chance of being hired even without a
high-school degree. "I just spent five and a half hours last night talking
with someone who has never graduated high school. And he is one of the most
innovative people I know," said Dr. Linton Wells II, assistant secretary of
defense for the Department of Defense.

Wells expalined that the government desperately needs qualified people as
40% of the senior personnel will be retiring during the next few years. With
this upcoming shortage, the government is willing to accept people gaining
skills away from schools. "The last standing perception of government
service is that you need a college degree,"  
said Wells. He said this perception does not match reality. According to
Wells, many employees, contractors and even people in the senior executive
service do not have degrees.

Christy told us that becoming a contractor first is the "easiest and
quickest" way to eventually getting a government job and said 60% of his
organization is composed of contractors. Government hiring procedures often
can be "slow and antiquated" and working with contractors sometimes is the
only option to complete a critical job, he explained.

"If we need immediate help, we will hire someone as a contractor and then
try to create a government position to move him into," said Christy. He
added it can take "two to three years" for that position to be created.

Another misconception, according to the Defcon speakers, is that security
clearances take months or even years to complete. Christy told us that new
hires are getting cleared surprisingly quickly. In many cases, hires can
receive an interim secret clearance in about 3 to 4 weeks. According to
Christy, the interim check consists of a "quick little" background inquiry
and a check for warrants and convictions. "Even some people in government
are surprised at how quickly people are being cleared," Christy said.

Even though the government is willing to drop the four-year degree
requirement, other federal agents on the panel warned of requirements that
cannot be eliminated. Mike Jacobs, vice president and director of SRA and a
former deputy associate director of the NSA, warned about security
clearances.

"You gotta sit and take the polygraphy, folks," said Jacobs. However this
strict polygraph requirement only exists at some agencies - like the NSA.
Both Dr. Wells and Christy told us that polygraphs are usually not required
for other government agencies.

Many people and probably most Defcon attendees believe polygraphs are
required for most government jobs, but Wells said, "This is absolutely not
true... polygraphs are not required for most secret level jobs."  
Christy told us, "Everyone doesn't have to be polygraphed. In certain
programs, up to 90% are not polygraphed."

The applicants that must face a polygraph often just take a basic polygraph
instead of the much tougher "lifestyle" polygraph test.  
"Basically, we ask if you are a spy in the basic test," said Christy.

Other factors that could disqualify an applicant are financial problems and
drug use. Financial responsibility is the "number one"  
disqualifier, but Christy adds that drug use is also a major disqualifier.
"If you used drugs in the last year, you would probably be precluded.

It is possible that you have missed nothing.

A couple of things to be aware of.
Hard drives consume more current than CD drives.  If the adapter is
being powered by
the USB port then you have a problem unless you are using a laptop
drive and even
then it still could be a problem.  Power could still be the problem if
the external PS
is under rated for HD's.

Check the web site of the manufacture to determine if they have HD
support in the
USB adapter set.

If you are using a slide in enclosure bay, change the bay.  It could
be the cable or
connector in that bay.

Have you considered using the Flashblock extension instead?  Flash

Same effect, no tedious scripting, loading/unloading and suchlike.

I'm not aware of any way to do network root and network booting over a
wireless lan.  It's important to note that network root over wireless 
would magnify all the security problems.  Lose signal, lose host.
I don't think anyone has played with networking enough till they
have experimented with remote root and network booting.  For large
distributed computing environments, the cost savings can be
incredible.  While wired networks are supposedly more secure than
wireless ones, it's important to note that wire tapping can 
become a big time issue with copper cables.  You csn't wire tap
a radio signal.  A software secure wireless network could indeed
be safer than a wired one that is vulnerable to tapping, but not
as fast.  Has 54mbps wireless been exceeded yet?

Subject: [PLUG] ReactOS new release out...
Message-ID: <1155708523.44e2b66bf30c6@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

It is still fairly dysfunctional, but at lease there is some progress.  
With the release of ReactOS 0.3.0 RC2, I'm wondering when a 1.0 version 
will finally come out.  

I'm concerned about the developer forum comment, 
"we implemented ReactOS in ring 0 to be driver compatible with drivers
released for Windows NT."  Hmm, I have yet to even see a working device
manager implementation let alone a working clone of the Windows add new
hardware wizard.  Touting ReactOS as a future free replacement for 
yesterday's version of Windows may be a pipe dream.  Apparently, NTFS 
won't be supported for a long time because some of it's inner details 
are secret.  Who is to say that the Win32 API alone defines Windows, 
any version, completely?  ReactOS can't currently replace Windows 95 
and Windows NT very well let alone any newer version of Windows.  
Implementing a Windows like system from the ground up under the GPL 
probably isn't worth it if the result isn't sufficiently stable and 
compatible with existing Windows software.  Maybe the ReactOS 
community should focus on a good implementation of the portions of 
the Win32 API that are worthwhile and convincing vendors to write 
software specifically for ReactOS.  Just because Microsoft doesn't
pressure software vendors to write software that doesn't have to be
run as root doesn't mean that the ReactOS community can't attempt to.  

One major problem with Windows XP when you have multiple users is that 
shortcuts for new programs don't tend to propagate across all accounts 
and there seems to be no simple way to define which programs are visible 
to users on an individualized basis.  To be honest, I'm not certain how
to do this in gnome on top of Linux either.  For example, I want evolution
installed to gnome, but I don't necessarily want user XYZ to be allowed to
use it.  I want to be able as the administrator to define any lower users
desktop and enforce that definition to varying degrees.  I may, for example,
want to limit sudo on a Linux system and runas on a Windows machine.

Why doesn't Microsoft offer to help the ReactOS community get their system
out of Beta and use the system as the basis for the next commercial version 
of Windows?

Message-ID: <34097.170.135.112.12.1155752874.squirrel@mail.patch.com>

OK bind wizards . . .

IXFR is failing between our primary DNS server and a customer's secondary.

We see the IXFR request, the response, then no transfer.

The question I have is:  is there anything in the response that indicates the
secondary should not initiate the transfer?  My eyeballing the packet decode
doesn't find anything.   It looks to me as if the event sequence is:

  Secondary - send IXFR pkt
  Primary   - respond with SOA
  Secondary - decides to initiate TCP for IXFR or not

Is this accurate?

That is accurate.  When it was suggested the client put a sniffer on the same
segement as their DNS server they discovered an internal firewall rule blocking
the traffic.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't a large part (if not virtually all)
of the concern about wireless networking preciesly because it's much
easier to intercept signals? Even if it does take some non-standard
equipment, you don't need physical access to anything (aside from
being within range of the signal, which I assume is largely a function
of how sensitive your listening gear is.)

You could do it with groups and selective application of the x bit,
but I'd guess that any upgrade attempt would blow away your changes.

I would however, expect that it's easier to prevent user's from using
given applications to do the things you don't want them to do.  I'd
expect it's not the running of apps that you want to prevent, but the
side effects of those apps -- reading/writing from/to parts of the
disk, manipulating hardware of other types (playing audio, accessing
tape drives, etc..), or accessing the network, or parts of it.  The
means to prevent those things are well documented, and you'll have to
take those measures anyway (unless, of course, there really is an app
you just don't want anyone to run for reasons intrinsic to that
application.  I can't imagine any of the standard tools will fall into
that category though, in which case just don't give that user's group
execute permissions.)

"Let's get together with the hardware providers and Microsoft to make sure
that games only work well in Windows."

Is this why you often have to buy a new computer to play the latest games
even if you bought one last year, or two years ago?  With XBOX, it seems
that Microsoft is attempting to abandon the PC as a gaming platform.  
What would stop another group of people from saying, "We'll
develop cutting edge games which do not depend on secrets that people have
to pay a ton of cash for," from being successful as well?  Games certainly 
aren't the end all be all of life, I'm most interested in the potential 
angle.  

Another problem area, CAD/CAM programs.  AutoCad or MasterCam anyone?  Anyone
seen shops where Windows 2000 or 2003 is needed to run the CAD/CAM software?  

PCC and PSU attempt to lock computer science students into Microsoft Word,
latest version, and Waterloo Maple, latest version.  Weren't the Maple 6 
and Maple 9 releases fairly close together?  I remember at PCC that the
computers tended to have multiple versions of Maple and insufficient 
memory, as well a broken MS-Windows interface.  Computers in the classroom 
that are slow or broken seem rather pointless, yet I'm guessing that PCC 
lacks the will even for the math department to abandon Microsoft.  PSU 
appears to be no better about this.  PCC is trying to shove Maple into the
CS curriculum because of PSU.  Yes there is Maple for Linux, but that
costs just as much and you don't get free upgrades as you upgrade your
Linux system.  You are buying a binary, so it's easy to upgrade the
library it depends on.

Will American colleges and Universities ever become comparable to
institutions in foreign countries that have strong open source software/open
standards policies?  Why should students depend on proprietary hardware 
and software when they are supposed to be learning?  I think there is a strong
lobby for Microsoft to remain a monopoly even if college students and foreign
governments get fleeced by the company.  Is MIT the only American institution of
higher education that has an open lab?

Simple Answer:

American Colleges are designed to prepare young people for life in America.

This means that most if not all of the potential employers out there will be
using Microsoft products.

So why exactly should colleges teach student software that they won't be
using in the workplace???

I fully support open source software and all the effort behind it, but until
Corporate America gives

Up it's addiction to Microsoft, colleges NEED to be teaching it or our
students will be ill prepared.

even if you bought one last year, or two years ago?  With XBOX, it seems
that Microsoft is attempting to abandon the PC as a gaming platform.  
What would stop another group of people from saying, "We'll develop cutting
edge games which do not depend on secrets that people have to pay a ton of
cash for," from being successful as well?  Games certainly aren't the end
all be all of life, I'm most interested in the potential angle.  

Another problem area, CAD/CAM programs.  AutoCad or MasterCam anyone?
Anyone seen shops where Windows 2000 or 2003 is needed to run the CAD/CAM
software?  

PCC and PSU attempt to lock computer science students into Microsoft Word,
latest version, and Waterloo Maple, latest version.  Weren't the Maple 6 and
Maple 9 releases fairly close together?  I remember at PCC that the
computers tended to have multiple versions of Maple and insufficient memory,
as well a broken MS-Windows interface.  Computers in the classroom that are
slow or broken seem rather pointless, yet I'm guessing that PCC lacks the
will even for the math department to abandon Microsoft.  PSU appears to be
no better about this.  PCC is trying to shove Maple into the CS curriculum
because of PSU.  Yes there is Maple for Linux, but that costs just as much
and you don't get free upgrades as you upgrade your Linux system.  You are
buying a binary, so it's easy to upgrade the library it depends on.

Will American colleges and Universities ever become comparable to
institutions in foreign countries that have strong open source software/open
standards policies?  Why should students depend on proprietary hardware and
software when they are supposed to be learning?  I think there is a strong
lobby for Microsoft to remain a monopoly even if college students and
foreign governments get fleeced by the company.  Is MIT the only American
institution of higher education that has an open lab?

bzzzzzzzzt!  Wrong answer.  Trade schools are designed to prepare people 
for jobs.  Colleges are for teaching, not training.

Okay, maybe some colleges *are* designed for training lately, but that's 
maybe more lamentable than the idea that using Open Office means you 
can't manage if you get put in front of Word.  Learning by wrote isn't 
learning at all.

It seems like the lack of a ton of cash is a bit of a problem.  When you 
have to spend developers like bullets, it takes a good amount money to 
keep the clips full.

>Another problem area, CAD/CAM programs.

Again, a ton of cash.

What do they do to lock you in?  Require that you submit your code 
in .doc format?  Does visual studio compile .docs now?

As for the real world, are developers spending more time messing with 
change tracking of "design documentation" in Word than they are editing 
subversion commit messages with vim?

No one is well served a lack of subtlety in this debate.

There's a gray area between "Trade School" and "Ivory Tower." While 
there's certainly room for healthy disagreement as to where in that 
gray area colleges and universities should aim their curriculum, 
there's no room at all (in my mind) for denying the existence of that 
tension.

I cannot speak for PCC, but PSU most assuredly does not "attempt to lock
computer science students into Microsoft Word".  The vast majority of CS
(and math) classes assume and teach to a UNIX environment, often
Solaris, but frequently Linux.  I have never had a Professor ask for an
assignment in .doc format.  I *have* had professors specifically exclude
.doc from the list of acceptable formats.  As for the Maple requirement
for some classes, Maple is provided on the PSU lab computers, to which
you can SSH.  In fact the last project for which I needed to use Maple
was done entirely from home using Maple running at school, displaying at
home using the wonders of SSH X tunneling (not to mention the beauty of
a network transparent window system).

In fact, PSU is a very strong supporter of Open Source.  It hosts
freedesktop.org, for example.  They employ a number of professors who
are strong proponents and very active in different areas of OSS.
Microsoft's presence within the PSU CS department is minimal (although
growing slightly, no doubt as a result of some large donations) and it's
influence and prevalence within classes almost nil.

We're talking Windows here right?  Because I can think of a couple games 
off the top of my head that run on Windows and Linux, and their hardware 
requirements were no different.

How do you come to this conclusion?  Nintendo's et al, have been around 
since early 80's.  It's a huge market, and there's room for competition. 
  It seems much more plausible that they just wanted to get into the 
market.  You can look at MS's own game line up for PC's and see they're 
not letting titles go.  If they're attempting to abandon it they're 
doing a pretty bad job of it.

Like id, or Epic?  There are companies out there that do this.  And they 
probably lose money on it.  Sometimes the economics of developing a game 
for such a minute demographic actually matter.

AutoCAD used to run on Slowaris.  But it's hard to justify the R&D of 
porting such a huge application for all three customers that used it. 
Outside of that, there are many higher end, or discipline specific CAD 
programs that run on Linux, AIX, BSD, etc.  Think Catia, SDS, etc.

> PCC and PSU attempt to lock computer science students into Microsoft Word,

If you had to pick a word processing application that they will *most 
likely* use after graduation, and you could only pick one, which would 
it be?  The fight here should be getting full support for open document 
formats so regardless of word processor used it looks and prints the same.

You just don't want people to use MS.  This is the communistic, elitist 
side of the Linux group I can't stand.  You want people not locked into 
MS by locking them out.  You don't want choice.

> Will American colleges and Universities ever become comparable to

My wife works with international students, and she is partnering with a 
professor at PSU in some of what she does.  Students are coming over in 
droves because they want our college degrees.  I wouldn't necessarily 
pin it on a choice of OS for their motivation, but they don't really 
seem to care.

> Why should students depend on proprietary hardware 
> and software when they are supposed to be learning?

So proprietary = not learning?  You're just going too far with all of 
this.  It's "tool for the job".  Sometimes it's something that runs on a 
Win|Mac|Lin box and sometimes it isn't.  I see all of what you're saying 
as being just as bad as what you're complaining about.  You're just on 
the other side of the fence.

No, it's not.

I'm not saying colleges have to be "Ivory Tower", but should they be 
teaching architects how to weld or even swing a hammer?  I think you 
have to have a solid base in theory to be able to continue learning and 
stay innovative, but a high practical competence to be of any use.  I 
just think that you should get the practical experience from your 
summer job rather than a classroom.  If the classrooms teach only "how 
to work" and not "how things work", then you graduate in "ignorant 
consumer" mode and are powerless to innovate.  However, like the 
architect and engineer of the Hyatt Regency walkway, we have to 
understand that it just isn't feasible to run a 60' rod through three 
flying walkways without some inefficient gymnastics of temporary 
support.

Back to being topical:  what better way to gain practical software 
development experience than studying, using, and contributing to open 
source code?

There's not a huge gap between theory and practice in software anyway, 
so of course writing code that doesn't compile won't solve any 
problems.  But, repeatedly tapping F9 in visual studio without any way 
to really see what's happening just encourages the "I dunno, magic?" 
view of technology.  Maybe learning the GNU toolchain and running Linux 
is more about practice than theory though?  I'm not saying there are 
easy answers, it just seems like a CS department built entirely on 
Windows is like housing the architecture department in a strip mall.  
Except, to make that analogy work, we have to put blinders on everyone 
in the department to illustrate the black-box-as-counter-example thing.

And of course developers are both craftsmen and scientists, so a good CS 
department should probably be a "Towering Ivory Trench".

I am hearing your angle as, "Applications running platform independent."
I am not a programmer so I do not know how difficult it would be to code a
platform independent application. I assume that it would be quite difficult,

<snip>

I do not see these schools as locking 'computer science students' in to MS anything.
I would agree that among non comp sci and math majors, there is little (if any) 
teaching in alternative operating systems. Of course the artist majors are 
using macs for music and drawing.

<snip>
Computers in the classroom that are slow or broken seem rather pointless, 
yet I'm guessing that PCC lacks the will even for the math department to

Would the math department have to train students to use a Linux box to 
complete homework? It seems to me, that it would be quite outrageous to 
expect students to learn new operating systems and applications before 
they can do their homework. So do you make Linux 100 a prerequisite for 
math 243? Again, why waste a students time and money to learn an OS,
they will only use for three months?

Having said that... Why not teach students OpenOffice.org with the CS120,
and CS121 classes? My guess is that there are no books that cover both MS
Office and OpenOffice.org

<snip>
PCC is trying to shove Maple into the CS curriculum because of PSU.  Yes

We have some very good schools that have oss policies. Foreign countries are

tend to be very specific in nature.

Many countries are going to open source because of the MS world. College
students aren't getting fleeced by MS, nearly as much as they are on their
books. I mean really, what is the dollar ratio of software to books? How
much did you spend on software during the last year, and how much did you 
spend on books? How many books were not purchased back by the school? I don't
know about you but a $100 a book can be outrageous.

Re: CAD/CAM in Windows.

Some of the more mature, and full-functional class solid modelers, such as 
Pro/Engineer and Unigraphics NX, and possibly IDEAS as well, were originaly 
written to run on Unix big-iron. (I ran EDMICS in Unix on an SGI Spark 
Station in 1991.) NASTRAN is another fossil that's still used heavily in 
automotive design world for things like crash-simulation and crumple-zone 
designs.

When Windoze came on strong in the mid-90's. these companies had to re-write 
their core software to run in the MS world. Pro/E version 10 did this by a 
wierd kind of internal Unix emulator - in your C:/Program Files/proe 
directory were a bunch of subdirectories labled 'usr,' 'lib,' 'bin,' and so 
on...

COSMOS/M though, emerged out of the MS-DOS text-adventure command line epoch; 
I don't think it has any *nix roots.

Wow that's ambitious :)

I was thinking more on the lines of renting a half or full rack in an
existing colo -- this would give each person a lower space and
bandwith cost, over each person getting colo space on their own.

The questions I'm currently wondering about are if there would be
enough people willing to join a co-op, and if the savings would be
enough to make it worthwhile.

Hi,

As a full time instructor at PCC in the Computer Information Systems 
department I too am frustrated by the Microsoft centric nature of computer 
classes. Unfortunately, in this new era of tight budgets, we have to cancel 
classes which do not come close to paying for themselves, typically when 
enrollment is below 20 students. For whatever reason, CIS classes in Linux, 
open source software and security are less popular than MS oriented classes 
on similar topics.

I guess it might be more accurate to say more students ask for MS so that's 
what we shove down their throat :-)

Trust me, when a scheduled Linux Networking class is cancelled due to lack 
of students and I have to teach an MS class instead, it is distressing to 
me, the students and the community

Anybody interested in a Computer Forensics class for network 
administrators? I'm developing it now for Fall term and need more students...

Thanks,
Mike

Subject: [PLUG] Personalized Search Page Generator?
Message-ID: <20060820105754.GA1530@gate.kl-ic.com>


The top 10 or so of my browser bookmarks are for search engines:  
Google, Wikipedia, Addall(books), Switchboard, etc.  It would not
seem to difficult to build a local html (or if necessary, Java)
webpage that I can use as a homepage and search all these different
services by clicking different activation buttons.  Not a customized
portal page elsewhere, a page that is stored on my own machine that
I control.

I am not looking for the usual RSS feed pages, lots of content but
few data entry boxes.

If such a thing is possible, someone has probably already thought of
it, and a tool to design such customized home pages may be out there
on the web.  Any suggestions?

I'll be willing to bet that most search engines work like google, in
that they are stateless apps that use the querystring to convey all
needed information.  For example, here's a google URL to search for
"linux":

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=linux&btnG=Search

It wouldn't be tough to use wget or some other HTTP client to send
pre-crafted search querystrings to a list of search engines, and then
parse the responses and spew the data into your own view.

You mention java.  In any OO language, I readily envision a class called
SearchResource (or something) that is a superclass or interface for a
host of individual classes named "GoogleResource", "YahooResource", etc.
Each one could implement a method called "public String buildSearchUrl(String
searchQuery)" (or something) that would contain the logic needed to
craft a URL for that particular search engine, given the search query
that would normally be typed into that search engine's textbox.  Adding
a new search engine to your app would be as simple as adding a new
SearchResource subclass.

Oracle Global Search is a product that gives the corporate world a
google-like interface to all their data, including websites, database
tables and views, and (since it is an Oracle product) Oracle
Collaboration Suite.  It is a typical Oracle product, bloated to the
extreme.  Someone needs to come along and demonstrate that this task is
doable with a minimum of tight, concise code.

There are several fun challenges here: the reverse engineering of the
URLs of the major search engines; the abstraction of their differences
into a generic framework; the parsing of their text responses,
extracting the raw data and discarding the rest; and the display of the
data (well, this part is not so interesting).

Have you tried keyword searches in Firefox? Right-click on any search
field and select "Add a keyword for this search".

If I do the IMDb search field and set the keyword to imdb, then I can
enter "imdb snakes on a plane" in the Location bar to find out what
security scenarios TSA isn't accounting for.

Subject: [PLUG] Setting the Refresh rate for FC5???
Message-ID: <000a01c6c4d0$ccfea540$6d01a8c0@RAMA>

I am using FC5 with a Dell E173FP flat screen.
The monitor claims that 1280 X 1024 @60Hz is the "optimal" setting.
The only refresh rate that is selectable is 75Hz.
XP has no problem offering a 60Hz refresh.
At 1280 X 1024 @75Hz resolution some of the smaller text flickers.
I am unable to set the refresh rate to 60 Hz
I have poked at xorg.conf.  
There does not seem to be a setting in there for refresh rate.
Below is the EDID data pulled from the display.

I assume you've tried using the "Screen Resolution" program under 
Preferences in GNOME and found that it only displays 75Hz, correct?  I'm 
also assuming that you're using the standard [S]VGA connector as opposed 
to DVI.  Have you tried changing your monitor type to something else 
(Generic LCD Display/LCD Panel 1280x1024, or even one of the generic CRTs)?

Another solution that might be easier is in the "Monitor" section of 
your X11 configuration file, set the vertical refresh to only 60Mhz:

Section "Monitor"
     ...
     VertRefresh  60.0 - 60.0
     ...
EndSection

Depending on the type of video card you're using, it might also be 
corrected with proprietary NVidia or ATI video drivers.

Cheers,

Note that some colos (ELI frinstance) can give you a PSTN T1 of your own
pretty cheap if you want to start your own VoIP phone company.

They (ELI) provision a T1 right to the cabinet.  I find this as a bit of 
an additional expense up front as you have to provide a router w/ 
CSU/DSU.  It's been a while since I was out there, so maybe they offer 
throttled ethernet these days as well.

FYI, here's the relevant stanza from my FC5 xorg.conf:

Section "Monitor"
 ### Comment all HorizSync and VertSync values to use DDC:
        Identifier   "Monitor0"
        VendorName   "Monitor Vendor"
        ModelName    "Samsung SyncMaster 955df"
        DisplaySize  360        270
 ### Comment all HorizSync and VertSync values to use DDC:
        HorizSync    30.0 - 85.0
        VertRefresh  50.0 - 160.0
        Option      "dpms"
EndSection

Good luck,
Mike

Daniel,

Yes, I am connected using SVGA (through a KVM).
How do I select "Generic LCD Display/LCD Panel 1280x1024" for the display
type?
If I damage or delete xorg.conf, X sends me through a reconfiguration
process, but nothing to select display type.
The result of the reconfiguration is always worse that what I started with.

The "VertRefresh  60.0 - 60.0" has no effect.  Still set to 75hz.

Any more suggestions?

I assume you've tried using the "Screen Resolution" program under
Preferences in GNOME and found that it only displays 75Hz, correct?  I'm
also assuming that you're using the standard [S]VGA connector as opposed to
DVI.  Have you tried changing your monitor type to something else (Generic
LCD Display/LCD Panel 1280x1024, or even one of the generic CRTs)?

Another solution that might be easier is in the "Monitor" section of your
X11 configuration file, set the vertical refresh to only 60Mhz:

Section "Monitor"
     ...
     VertRefresh  60.0 - 60.0
     ...
EndSection

Depending on the type of video card you're using, it might also be corrected
with proprietary NVidia or ATI video drivers.

Cheers,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0608211035120.9621@blackbox.fnordora.org>

I ran into this yesterday. In case someone runs into a similar problem.

After a power reset, my mail server rebooted.  (I was troubleshooting a 
problem at the breakers and got the wrong one due to bad labeling.)

After the reboot, mail did not work at all.

The problem was that the greylisting database got corrupted when the 
reboot occurred.  The only indication was a message in /var/log/maillog 
about a timeout on the socket used by the greylisting daemon.

I stopped the greylisting daemon, deleted all the files in the greylisting 
database directory and restarted postgrey and postfix and everything was 
happy.

I will be installing a phone line at a house in
the boonies, its will just be used for a
couple builders. I put together a small linux
box, they will be doing web+web/email, and
open office calc.

I looked into dial up but so far best i have
found is $20/month.

Qwest has a package that gives you
phone +
extended area (scam) +
unlimied ld +
dsl +
msn (isp) for    $68/month

Anyone have a better idea ?

I've been very happy using SpiritOne DSL service.  I found out about it 
on this list.  A static IP with every account, modem in bridged mode. 
It's great.  Good prices too.

Is anyone else concerned with the move to wikis and web based documentation,
especially for recent Linux distros such as Fedora Core 5, that local
documentation will be increasingly treated as a thing of the past?  I need 
to know how to compile custom kernels to boot Fedora Core 3 and 5 NFS root.  
There used to be a kernel-source package, but now things have dramatically 
changed leaving me very confused.  I don't understand in Core 5 what the note 
that an initial ramdisk is required now means.  Information doesn't need to be 
on the web, it needs to be in my hands thank you.  This is especially true if
I'm unfortunate enough to find myself offline or trying to support an older
Fedora Core system that the web has lost interest in...

How about $29.99 for 6 months Comcast cable Internet promotion plus
Vonage for $27/month after taxes?  $68 is arguably a bargain if the 
non promotion price of $54 something has to be paid for cable Internet
unless: long distance, speed, or a second phone is an issue.  Some 
folks say that Vonage isn't interesting to them because it will go up 
dramatically in price.  Note that Vonage is only sold month to month, 
so anyone can get out of it.  Also, a second line on Vonage for faxes
is cheap and yes faxing does work over VoIP in my experience.

Vonage and cable Internet isn't likely to save you money, but it will
save you a headache by freeing you from the confusing phone bills of
traditional phone companies.  Some phone companies, like CenturyTel,
hit you with so many strange deposits that cable plus Vonage is 
always cheaper.  Unless you have to have a static ip subnet,
I recommend cable plus Vonage as the primary choice.  Comcast Cable and 
the local phone company are parallel monopolies right now.  No matter 
which one you choose, there are definite pros and cons.  Even if you get
DSL, I recommend stripping the POTS line down as much as possible and 
adding Vonage.  Sadly, most EAS areas shove the extension down people's 
throats so that traditional phone service for less than $35/month is 
hard to find anywhere anymore in Oregon.  EAS should be available, but 
not required.  Unfortunately, the telecommunications lobby must be 
strong enough to enforce an, "everyone pays for it, or noone gets it," 
policy.  EAS wiped out a lot of long distance where featherbedding and
monopoly status are contributing in my opinion to what the phone companies
do these days with their pricing.  If the phone companies want to survive,
they need to replace the frame relay infrastructure with either an ip
infrastructure or something else that's cheaper and higher bandwidth.

The biggest problem with phone companies today is that they require
contracts, so they are a poor option for say college students
that don't want to stay at the same residence for a whole year.  Cell
phones are popular, but they are not a cheap route to go for broadband
service.  Any kind of wireless is harder to secure than the wired 
alternatives.

It looks like the php is looking for 
/var/www/htdocs/obm/obminclude/obinclude/global.inc and not 
/var/www/htdocs/obm/obminclude/global.inc which is probably where the 
globals.inc file actually is.

If that is the case then you should either change the include path to 
"/var/www/htdocs/obm" or change the include to "global.inc"; probably 
changing your php.ini include path would be easier (remember to restart 
apache).

I'm assuming the full path to the file
is /var/www/htdocs/obm/obminclude/global.inc, right?  And you want to
include 'obminclude/global.inc', so you want to have
'/var/www/htdocs/obm' in the include path.

Brent,

   Yes, that was it. My php ignorance kept me from seeing that I specified
one directory too many. All fixed.

Extened area: (insert lots of 4 letter words)
 .. the line terminates in
the north plains switch. the house is in
the USPS area called Banks, i.e. it is
closer to Banks then it is to North Plains.
but is on the side of 26 that is services by
the N.Plains switch.

With out extened area, you would not be able
to call Banks 3 miles away with out a charge !

There's still a kernel source package, but it's now a
kernel.*.src.rpm, where it used to be a kernel-source.*.rpm.  And yum
won't get src rpms for you (grumble, grumble) so you have to drag it
down from one of the mirrors yourself.

As for documentation, is the kernel-doc package not being kept up to date?

AFAIK all of the fedora documentation is available for download..

But no, I'm not concerned about online documentation only.

That was fixed recently.  yumdownloader in the yum-utils package
downloads packages.  With the --source option, it downloads src.rpm
packages.  FC5 added repositories for sources but they are disabled by
default.  The -e option was recently added to yumdownloader to enable
repositories on the command-line.

yumdownloader -e updates-source --source kernel

I much preffer up-to-date, on-line, searchable docs that I can fix
when they're wrong to whatever was thrown together "because we've got
to ship something" when the packaged binary was created.

I *do* take advantage of the debian local docs, (in
/usr/share/doc/<packagename>) but generally that's the last resort.
(Well, before looking at the source.)

This has been the case if you have used the default install options since
FC1.  The kernel is built as modular as possible but the default install uses
LVM and must load these prior to mounting the Logical volume that contains
your root file system and swap partitions.

The initial ramdisk contain all the modules for mounting the Logical volumes
and a script to make all that happen.

The thing that got me was as I researching just this type of thing, I found out
that Fedora was using a different format for the initial ramdisk than what
everybody else had been using (and documented online).  Typically a ext2
FS gzipped.  Fedora a cpio gzipped.

If anyone is interested and does not have cable as an option

You can get a DSL loop throttled to 896K/1.5M + IP from
Easystreet for $43.50/month + taxes.

It is basically a phone line (called a loop in telco'eze) with
DSL (subscriber) but with out POTS (old school phone)

You can then subscribe to Vonage for $15 300mins/month
or $20/month unrestricted usage + free adapter to a POTS phone
for free.

So if dont have a cell phone, $65~70/month you get unlimited local
(such as my 3 miles = more $ with regular land line) and US long
distance and an IP connection.

Hmmm me thingk my POTS at home is going away, ....

Pete said something about "web+web/email".  While I'm not sure exactly 
what that means, if he intends on running a web or email server then he 
better check up on Comcast's TOS.  Last I checked running a server of 
any kind on their consumer service was not allowed.

I also think that this 'general rule' is way overrated and unenforcable. If 
they would disallow *all* incoming connections then you wouldn't be able to do 
much with your internet connection at all. Things like VoIP would fail to work, 
p2p traffic etc (even legal) stops functioning and technically those are 
'services' (think of your vonage box as a server accepting incoming VoIP phone 
calls).

The provider is covering his ass and wants you to prohibit making money off 
your service by running a pr0n site at home (or worse!). He does not want to 
prohibit you from running a webmail app for you and your wife, but he doesn't 
word it as such to deter 'fair use'. After all, all he wants is control over 
what you do with your connection ;) (world domination is next BTW).

There's no reason the ISP should go after you for hosting a ssh service on your 
box at home, or run a webmail app to check your personal mail. It's much the 
same as allowing remote help in windows (vnc for unix!)...

Cheers,

Auke

Space, space, and space again.  Printed books are even worse.  One of the 
reasons people will use a computer is to save space.  A lot of web pages, 
especially those in wikis, don't print right.  The Fedora Core community 
has done a very poor job from what I can see of providing printer friendly
documentation web pages.  In Windows, one can print postscript output to 
a file and view the file later.  I don't know about Linux on this.

Printing also costs money, name one place that will let anyone print
whole books for free?  Being the interest of broke college students,
one would think that the documentation community for Fedora could be
more thoughtful with their wikis.  ASCII text or Tex version anyone?

What I want to see more of are standalone web pages that I can download
in a documentation pack and burn to a CD or DVD.  I should be able to
download the final Fedora Core 5 docs when Fedora Core 6 comes out...

Fine Rogan, but at some point interest is lost in the current release
of Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora Core, etc.  It is likely to get harder
to find relevant docs online.  You can't always upgrade your Linux
distribution because support for older computers is quickly dropping.  
You have to have a 400 mhz Pentium for Fedora Core 5 and it is 
supposedly optimized for the P4.  I don't think it's unreasonable
to pursue a local copy of the last docs that are posted for 
todays most popular Linux distro that I am using.

Maybe what is needed is an rsyncable repository of high quality documentation
written with the future in mind.  Out of say 100 documentation files, only
a handful need to be replaced/updated if the writers are careful.  If there 
is a way to download the wikis for Fedora Core 3, I'd love to hear about it.  
Thing is, I think a long term documentation project dealing with all of the
Fedora Core releases makes more sense.  As far as answering ones questions 
by looking at the source Rogan, how can you manage to be quick enough with 
that method?  Source perusal takes a lot of time and requires a lot of skill. 
If Linux distributions are only practical for prorgammers, then a lot of
people who could be good administrators otherwise are just simply out of
luck I guess.  It's not just an understanding of Ansi C that's needed to
read Linux's source code, I'd say one needs to understand much more than
that.

See, I just don't believe that it's becoming that much more difficult
to get a current distro on old hardware (There is one exception:  If
your hardware doesn't support networking and has no input devices
newer than a 5.25" disk -- even then, you can still install almost any
version of slackware.).  The kernel has improved in performance and
hardware support constantly over the years, and the infinite
customizability means you can remove bloated packages in favor of more
streamlined applications and environments.

The defaults of the mainstream distros have changed, and now those
defaults (such as gnome / kde) take more resources as the defaults
used in older versions -- however that does not mean that the "lean"
apps are no longer available.  There is still a large segment of the
computing market that deals with new, but computationally weak
machines (compared to the current desktops).  Kiosks and embeded
devices come to mind.

Unless you start citing references, and demonstrate that you've made
an honest attempt at the things you say are impossible, I see no
reason to believe your ramblings.  Particularly since my experience is
contrary to your statements.

This is much what TLDP was -- I'm not sure of the state of it now,
however.  (Note that tldp wasn't that much different from a wiki that
was printable....)

Sorry, I forgot the <sarcasm></sarcasm> tags when I posted that
satirical comment.

I *have* looked at the source to figure out what an app does, but
that's just because I'm weird.

the way i looked at it was the $20 is less then getting extened area
coverage with LD tossed in. They have a lower $ plan, that you pay
for all LD minutes instead.

don't know of anyone cheaper. be interesting to see their operating
costs.

Subject: [PLUG] DHCP Question
Message-ID: <44ECBFBB.4070102@gisnet.com>

I just installed Fedora Core 5 as a workstation using pretty much the 
default settings. This morning the machine was running Windows XP and 
the DHCP connection to the internet was working fine (i.e. all hardware 
and connections were okay.) But for some reason FC5 on this same machine 
isn't geting a DHCP connection. It recognizes the eth0 card, but seems 
to hang trying to get IP information and then fails to connect.

Since I know all the hardware was okay, I assume this is due to some 
configuration setting that I don't know about. I'm sort of new to this, 
so I don't even know what to look for or what info to report to get 
help. Can someone get me started?

I did notice in in the Gnome "Network proxy" utility that it's set to 
"direct connection to the Internet" and I don't think that's right, but 
I don't know what to change it to, if I should change it at all.

Any help on this problem or how to track it down would be much appreciated!

TIA,
- Bill Thoen

I didn't say I agreed with it, but if you're running services you and 
other people are depending on, and if money is involved, you don't take 
chances like that.  They can easily enforce it.  They just disable your 
account.

Bill,

On my FC5 there is a dhclient command.  Looks like there is even a
dhclient.conf file, too.

I typed: apropos dhcp and found this command.

Could you please supply the output from the following commands, run as

be in a root-only path):

- lspci

This would help troubleshooting efforts immensely.

I would attempt the following things to see what the problem is:

1.  Restart the computer at least once with the network cable plugged in 
the entire time (I'm sure you've already done this).

2.  Try using a static IP address with the values DHCP gives you in 
Windows.  If you don't know how to change this manually, you can access 
the graphical network configuration program in the Fedora menu by going 
to: "System" -> "Administration" -> "Network".  When you've set up a 
static IP address, try pinging the router or another computer on the 
network (ping the gateway address for example:  "ping x.x.x.x").

If pinging works, then you can change the settings back to DHCP as your 
network card appears to have been properly detected under Linux.  If it 
doesn't work, you may have some bigger issues involving hardware 
compatibility (or firewall, see below):

3.  While the default firewall settings for FC5 have holes automatically 
built-in to handle DHCP, if you've made any modifications to the rules, 
it could be your firewall.  Try temporarily disabling your firewall by 
running the following command as root:  "service iptables stop".  This 
disables the firewall until you restart your computer or type "service 
iptables start".  Once the firewall is disabled, try running (also as 
root):  "service network restart", which will try to restart the network 
services and bring up DHCP.

Let the list know if any of this does/doesn't work.

Cheers,

I haven't found it difficult to do the same thing on Linux. I tend to filter 
all my printer output through "kprinter" and it allows me to select one of my 
configured printers or there are additional options to print to a Postscript 
or PDF file.

Given the variety of printing and filtering tools available for Linux I'm sure 
there are a variety of ways to accomplished what i do in many different ways. 
I do like online or "soft" documentation since it can be searched more 
quickly compared to paper documentation but I still buy reference books once 
in a while as well.

Curiouser and curiouser... It seems that during the night a miracle 
occured, because when I started up the machine this morning everything 
worked. The problem with the eth0 card not getting a DHCP connection 
seems to have fixed itself! Apparently, waiting 5 minutes yesterday 
before a cold boot wasn't long enough (which I tried twice), but waiting 
all night did the trick.

So I guess there's some truth to the rumour that if you have a machine 
with nVidia chips and something called "forcedeth" and you run Windows 
XP before you install Linux, that Windows leaves the ethernet card in 
such a state of shock and awe that it won't connect to DHCP under FC5 
(even though all evidence other than the obvious says it's working) 
until you shut the whole thing down for a while (longer than 5 minutes.)

Anyway, thanks everyone for your kind assistance and patience with my 
lack of knowledge.

I used to dual boot laptops and desktops and generally didn't experience this 
behavior. Once in a while when I did have DHCP issues in Linux I would 
usually just restart the network service which caused the DHCP client to also 
be stopped and restarted.

If you're really curious you might run something like "ethereal" and watch the  
traffic on your network if you have anymore problems like this. You should be 
able to see the DHCP request go out from your client box and see if the DHCP 
server's responds or not.

Modern machine don't power all the way off when you press the power
button.  One of the things that is left on is the ethernet chip as it has
an option to wake up the machine from what would otherwise be an
off condition.  This is a management option of most motherboards these
days.  That option should be able to be turned off in the bios setup.

Subject: [PLUG] listing of --bind mounts
Message-ID: <44EDCFAD.7010101@acm.org>

How do I get a listing of the 'submounts' (?) those mounts done using 
the --bind switch?

It appears I'm clueless on this but I have RFTM or at least the man page 
for the mount command but still don't see a method.

All I'm seeing is the regular mounts; partitions, nfs, etc.


TIA,

Mine shows 'bind' in the mount-option field of the 'mount' command:

$ mount|grep bind
/home on /net/rheingold/home type none (rw,bind)
/var/ftp on /net/rheingold/var/ftp type none (rw,bind)

(This is some cleverness on automount's part, since it's not generally
possible to mount an NFS export from the same machine that's exporting
it.  The bind mount puts it in the right place so the NFS server doesn't
have to be a special case.)

Thanks for the easystreet tip Pete.  Unfortunately, your phone lines
apparently have to be owned by Qwest.  My folks are trapped with CenturyTel,
CenturyTel won't even release your current phone number for use with Vonage.  
Getting POTsless DSL in a number of areas, including Scappoose, probably 
involves having your own dry pair laid.  One might as well have fiber optic 
cable laid instead.  My girlfriend and I had reasonable luck using mgetty and 
kermit chipset modems to do dial-up.  Something like that, your down to the 
cost of the phonelines.  You don't want to do dial-up if it can be avoided.
I think the cheapest ISP is $10.95/month, peoplepc.  I doubt that the 
el-cheapo outfits are Linux friendly.

If the climate is dry, wireless should work really well.  If you can establish
a stable wireless connection to broadband somewhere else, go with VoIP and 
you're set.  Either that, or start a cooperative and run landlines over your
partners' private property to hook everyone together.  If the prices are steep
enough in the area, a cooperative could prove very cost effective.

Concerning comments that Comcast doesn't want anyone to make money with their
residential service, why would that be so?

Has any company come out with decent Linux friendly two way satellite service?

I contacted easystreet.  In Scappoose, CenturyTel owns the phonelines.
Qwest has to own them.  CenturyTel wouldn't even release my girlfriend's 543
number when she switched to Vonage.  At least in St. Helens, which is Qwest, 
it should be possible to get dry-pair DSL.

Have any companies come out with Linux compatible 2 way satellite service?
Starband 360 is the best I've ever seen.  It wasn't impressive in my 
opinion because you had to use winproxy under Windows 2000.  The satellite 
was USB connection only unfortunately.  In a predominantly dry area, 
Baker or Burns for example, satellite and wireless connections are far 
more reasonable than they are around Portland.  Still, personaltelco seems
to do quite well.

I'm curious why Comcast or any other landline service provider would want
to keep "residential" customers from conducting business over their network?
What is a company like Comcast afraid of?

On the subject of unenforceable, who was smoking crack when they wrote in 
the manual for Magical Quest III on the gameboy that you can't make backup
copies or even attempt to operate the game on a different type of computer?

Thanks Wil.  This doesn't show on my setup.  It is a little different. 
A Linux-Vserver with a nfs mount in the host to a fileserver and then 
some Vserver magic to get a portion ( sub-directory ) of that mount into 
each Vserver guest.

I have a message to the Linux-Vserver list but sometimes they are slow 
to respond to the list as most are in Europe and do a lot of the work 
via chat.


Again thanks,
Rod

going to occur Tuesday afternoon.

Here is a quick summary:
 * Penguin Computing server
 * Sangoma POTS cards (8 ports FXO)
 * Signate sigMAN with their own asterisk/CentOS distro
 * Snom 360 with expansion bridge for reception
 * 30 Snom 320's (we only need to configure 5, show the client how to do
the rest)

It is compatible with most Linux distros.

I would use either GAIM or Kopete over what the version of messenger that 
Yahoo has available for Linux. They've haven't updated it in years. I 
guessing since there are open source versions of IM clients available they'll 
probably never update their own IM client.

I use GAIM myself on my own systems and we've even been encouraged to start 
using GAIM at work as since we have an internal Jabber server. GAIM is also 
multi-platform and is available for Windows so when I need to use Windows I 
don't need to have both Yahoo and MSN clients running to have all of my IM 
contacts available.

How is GAIM's Jabber support these days?  I used to use it a fair
amount, but it's Jabber support was somewhat limited in comparison with
Psi.  It lacked service browsing, multi-user chat extensions, raw stream
monitoring, etc.  With Jabber gateways to other IM networks, I don't
actually need anything other than a Jabber client (although some of the
more advanced features of the other networks are not available).

All of my friends and relatives are either on Yahoo or MSN for IM and so I 
hadn't used a Jabber server up until the announcement was made at work. GAIM 
is simple enough to setup and works quite well the company Jabber server 
which allows me to keep in touch with colleagues that work in other parts of 
the country.

I have finally resolved my refresh problem.
In addition to adding your suggested: VertRefresh  60.0 - 60.0
I needed to add to the monitor section: Option "DDC" "false"

With the addition of the option, the refresh rate is now 60

Thanks

Subject: [PLUG] Personal Telco Field Day 2006 report
Message-ID: <86odu6gia0.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


The Personal Telco Project held a Field Day[0] yesterday in which it
practiced its ability to construct long-distance wifi links.  By
Slashdot standards these were pretty short ones, but for most of us
doing the practicing they were pretty long ones.

The Field Day has been an annual event of Seattle Wireless[1].  This
year we were invited to participate with a coordinated event here.  In
the end we discovered that Seattle Wireless had decided to put off
their event until October.

On Wednesday evening, a group of PTP activists hiked or biked to the
top of Mt Tabor to scout out sites.  I was surprised when, unaided by
special antennas, I was able to intermittently connect about 2 miles
to one of our nearby nodes, the Hawthorne Hostel [2], with my laptop.
With a viable link to the outside world, we considered other
destinations.  One of our group, Tamarack Birch Wheeles, works at
Portland State University and has access to the roof of the Ondine
building, which we could see clearly from our perch on Mt Tabor.
Another feature visible was Council Crest, which has good access by
vehicle, so we hopped into Tamarack's car and headed over to scout
there as well.

Council Crest has good views to the northeast, less good to the east,
but if you stood in just the right spot, in a gap between a couple of
trees, through binoculars you could make out the street light above
the spot where we'd been standing on Mt Tabor.

Over the next couple days, scurrying ensued, as we had not really been
preparing or planning very much since we first found out about this
event about 6 months ago.  I worked on getting some of our two-radio
outdoor enclosures[3] ready, assembling needed high-gain antennas and
other gear, considering power supplies, etc.  Then, at the last
minute, we discovered two things: a) that Seattle Wireless had
postponed their end, which took some of the pressure off; and b) that
due to family obligations, I (aggregator of most of the gear) wouldn't
be able to get started until late morning on the day of the event.  Oh
well.  We carried on as best we were able.

When I arrived on Saturday morning at about 11 am, Tom Higgins,
Tamarack and Don Park had set up near the reservoir on Mt Tabor and
were scouting out signals from a vehicle-mounted yagi.  This location
was further down the hill from our original site.  Tom could hear the
Hostel node, but not associate, which might have been an issue either
with the location, or perhaps the radio card or associated drivers.
Meanwhile, I set about configuring our Metrixes to make sure we had
them working correctly at close range before attempting the longer
shot to Council Crest.  Tom Higgins had brought a nice marine battery,
from which he operated an inverter which allowed me to keep my laptop
charged up, as well as supplied the Power-over-Ethernet injectors to
energize the Metrixes.

After about 90 minutes of fiddling, during which Sam Churchill
arrived, we had the Metrixes ready to go and configured for the most
interesting Mt Tabor-Council Crest link.  Tom and Don took their
Metrix, Sam's tripod-mounted 24 dBi dish antenna, and an omni with
them to Council Crest, while Tamarack departed for the Ondine and Sam
and I headed for the top of Mt Tabor.

The upper loop at Mt Tabor is beyond a locked gate, requiring us to
cart our gear up on foot.  Having anticipated this, I had brought
along a jogging stroller.  Sam and I parked at the gate, loaded up the
stroller with about 50-75 lbs of gear secured with gaffers tape, and
pushed it through the gate and up the paved road about a 5-10 minute
walk to the top.  Arriving on site, we set about assembling a
non-penetrating "tripod"[4] we had borrowed from the Mississippi
Grant Project stores.

Don had brought along FRS radios for the event, and we were able to
maintain voice contact between Mt Tabor and Council Crest while we
were getting set up.

At the Mt Tabor end we attached two panel antennas to the mast.  One
was a 19 dBi loaned by Sam Churchill, pointing at Council Crest.  The
other was a 13 dBi, pointing at the Hostel.  We discovered a slight
problem with the mast mounting hardware, which consists of machined
aluminum brackets, on one of the antennas.  The bolts that hold the
opposing brackets together around the mast were inexplicably not long
enough to accommodate the diameter of the mast.  We swapped bolts with
the other antenna so that the more critical 19 dBi antenna had the
better mounting and then jury-rigged the other less-critical antenna
with one bolt and some gaffers tape.

All this activity, with the odd, un-park-like gear, attracted a fair
number of questions from passersby.  One gentleman approached and
started to ask some questions, and it soon became apparent that he was
there "on purpose".  Jay was in town from his home in Seaside for
another event.  He'd heard about our Field Day from a friend of his
who lives in Arizona, who had suggested that our thing might be worth
checking out.  While Jay got filled in on some of the details, he pitched
in and helped as we assembled the final bits.

On Mt Tabor we didn't have a nice marine battery and inverter to use
with the PoE injector, so after mounting the Metrix to the mast, we
opened the enclosure and applied 12V to the internal power jack and
device sprung to life.

We used channel 1 on the longer link, since the Hostel's node operated
on channel 11.  I had configured the Mt Tabor node radio to AP mode
with an SSID of: www.personaltelco.net/tabor.  I logged into the local
Metrix from my laptop via ethernet.

Right away, we had a solid signal to the Hostel, and I was seeing what
our driver (madwifi-ng) reported as "associations" from the Council
Crest Metrix and one other, which turned out to be Tamarack's Apple
laptop from the Ondine.  However at first, neither of them were
_actually_ associated.  As we started fiddling with the gear to get
the Council Crest link working, Tamarack got his Cisco 1242ag device
out.  We fiddled a little with our antenna aim, which didn't help
much.  Then, ultimately, the Council Crest crew decided to try
flipping polarity of the antenna.  We'd set up vertical polarity at
Mt Tabor, and Council Crest initially thought they had as well (I
think they were just confused).  They flipped the tripod over 90
degrees, and BAM, association!  

We spent another 15 minutes or so getting some minor NAT issues and a
little local DNS problem worked out, until I was able to authenticate
with the NoCatAuth captive portal software at the Hostel node, and
then Council Crest was online!  Tom got on the IRC channel, made a
Skype call over the link, and was generally just pleased.

Afterwards, we repointed the Mt Tabor antenna about 5 degrees to the
right to hit Ondine, but despite polarity flipping, could not
establish an association there.  We decided, as the Ondine roof was no
doubt quite warm by this time, it was not worth trying to debug on the
spot.  We called it quits and began tearing down the gear.

The link to Council Crest was about 5.6 miles (9 km), according to our
GPS coordinates and an online calculator.  The radios at either end
were ~19 dBm, with 24 dBi and 19 dBi antennas at the end points.  We
had some modest Fresnel zone interference at the Council Crest end.
The link to the Hostel was about 2.0 miles (3.2 km), which we
connected to with a 19 dBm radio and 13 dBi panel.  The Hostel's gear
consists of an unspecified Cisco outdoor AP and antenna originally
donated by Intel and installed about 4 years ago.

We were pleased with our success, modest though it was, and resolved
to try something slightly more ambitious next time: perhaps an
additional link to Rocky Butte, and/or (if we can do it before winter
weather sets in) a longer link to the top of Larch Mountain, about 25
miles to the east.

How much damage can you do with a normal account anyways?  If all software is
safe and can't be operated in a malicious manner against the system, or in such
a way that a normal user becomes root, how much risk is there?  One of the
beauties of Linux is that even baseline security allows for the seperation of
users.  How much damage can an ordinary user do with rm -rf * from /?  Is
chrooting users to their home directories an attempt to solve a problem that
doesn't exist?  Maybe a better solution is per user permissions on programs
and not allowing any user to install or run a program in his/her home directory
without oversight.  With chroot, you are talking massive overhead and
duplication of software.  I believe SELinux is an attempt to implement finer
grained security that goes beyond user, group, and world permissions on files.

Maybe the overriding concern is that you want users to write to one particular
place on your filesystems and nowhere else.  On an ordinary system, they can't
write to a directory they don't own unless they get permission to somehow. 
There may be ordinary users that are a problem, they set their permissions
wrong.  How about wrapping ftp with ssh and going back to a true ftp session?

Given infinite time any code can be cracked.  This isn't a problem if the
information being protected becomes irrelevant.  The ether in ethernet is 
a radio term, there actually is a radio field out to a certain distance 
around an ethernet cable.  Thing is, tapping a copper cable is a cheaper 
way to spy on wired lan than purchasing the expensive radio equipment.

If you have encryption disabled, common considering how much of a pain 
wireless ethernet encryption schemes are to work with especially in 
Linux, then wireless is significantly less secure than it's wired 
cousin.

About non standard radio equipment, if you have to be in the same block
to tap into an ethernet cable's RF field, that could look awfully 
suspicious.

By abandoning dhcp and firewalling wireless links tightly, you can 
discourage people from hopping on and getting a free ride.  If you
have a skilled radio technician that records your signal...  you
better be encrypted if anything important is going out.  The radio
interception problem exists for wired networks, but the proximity
that the spy has to be within is different.

How secure is wireless via laser light compared to wireless via an 
RF signal?  If laser light can be pinpointed and interception can 
be caught in real time, it is a potentially more secure then RF.

Slackware 10.1 is a lot easier to network boot than Fedora Core 1.  A lot of
people say that slackware's rc scripts are easier to imderstand than Fedora's
init scripts.  

The way the pango etc. libraries are twisted into packages, I question if 
there is a Linux distribution today that isn't library and dependency hell.  
I think a library manager would be far more helpful than a package manager 
if indeed a library is broken.  I wonder if http://www.linuxprinting.org/
has a mailing list where this problem is mentioned?

On package management being so hyped by people, that's exactly why my
oldest brother abandoned Debian.  He got overwhelmed by Debian wanting
to install kde on him.  Being a slackware fan before, he still had 
problems with dependencies in Debian.  I think he's back to Slackware,
though he could just be an OSX user.

According to the posted interview, Fedora is not bleeding edge.  I've had
problems more often with CentOs more than I have with Fedora.  Fedora does
seem to be getting fat though.  Fortunately, the focus now appears to be
trimming  the fat.  Is there a free up-to-date maximum rpm floating around?

I'm blocking icmp fragmentation needed packets I think.  Turns out, taking
the 10 megabit hub out fixed the problem.  You have to fragment to go from
100 mbps network to a 10 mbps network.  Question is, how do I get iptables
to log this problem?  Maybe it wasn't logging on the server because it was
a problem for the client?  Anyone have some definitive guides on the icmp

Message-ID: <20060829001237.GA12968@www.gisnet.com>

I've got a problem with the cursor in the graphic interface going
invisible. Here's the scenario: I boot up my Fedora Core 5 system in
runlevel 3 (text mode). Then, when I want to switch to the Gnome desktop, I
run startx. Everything's fine; the monitor is running at 1280 x 1024
resolutoin and the cursor is visible. Then later, I log out back to text
mode. The trouble happens when I run startx again. This time the cursor is
invisible. The cursor is still working, but I just can't see it. The only
way I've been able to fix this is to reboot the system, but this isn't an
ideal way to operate.

Has anyone got any ideas how I can fix this?

I don't know if this helps, but here's some bits from /etc/X11/xorg.conf:

This is appears to be a know bug and relates to NVidia cards.  Have a 
look at the following bug report:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=182517

Also have a look at the following forum thread:
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=447233

If these don't directly help, make sure that you've upgraded to the 
latest RPMs.  Also try changing "nv" to "vesa" and see if that solves 
the mouse issues when restarting X...if so then it's probably definitely 
with the "nv" driver.

If you're using an nvidia card with the nv driver, why not take the next
step and use the nvidia driver from nvidia corp (rather than the nv
driver in the kernel)?  If the problem is a driver issue, then a
different, better (opengl) driver just may fix it, and you'll be able to
play tux racer too.

I'm a gentoo guy, therefore I'm accustomed to getting the driver using
portage.  Perhaps you can get the driver for fedora using the usual
package management system, whatever it may be?

When using the nvidia driver, you change "nv" to "nvidia" in xorg.conf.
Also, after every kernel rebuild you'll have to reinstall the driver
(quick operation, easy to do).

It was going to install KDE because he wanted a package that requires the
KDE libraries to install. Debian's front ends make it pretty easy to
determine what package(s) depend on those libraries if you want to remove
the libraries. Debian will even listen to you if you get insistant and
tell it to remove libraries and damn the consequences. I have noticed the
situation of all the booby-trap packages that suck in KDE/emacs without
it being obvious, it would be nice to have a
do-not-even-suggest-installing-this-package flag, similar to the "hold"
flag.

The decision is simple, do you go for package management systems which
guarentee (or should guarentee) that all packages will work, but will
suck in packages/libraries you don't want; or do you go for a system
where you manually select all packages to install and can prevent the
installation of undesirable ones, but at the cost of manual dependancies
and possibly broken packages due to forgetting a library? I don't think
it is worth my time handling dependancies fully manually.

Unfortunately, people who experience the problem with the "nv" driver 
also seem to experience the same problem with the [proprietary] "nvidia" 
driver.  It appears to be more related to using hardware acceleration to 
draw the mouse with certain video cards.  It could be corrected in the 
driver, but it's part of an initial flaw possibly in the chipset; I 
don't know enough about this to be sure, just read the bug reports at 
RedHat and upstream at freedesktop.org.  The problem goes away for most 
people by turning off the hardware accelerated mouse support in the 
X.org configuration file, which the bug reports explain how to do as a 
workaround.

Thanks, Daniel!   Putting :
Option "HWCursor" "Off"
in the Devices section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf did the trick!

Now I have a new problem... Now if I run startx too many times, the 
"power daemon" refuses to to reload. I'm getting tired of chasing these 
little bugs just because I want to do things differently from the norm, 
so maybe I'll just boot up in graphic mode and be done with the stupid 
thing! I just like the black background and white text of the text 
inteface better than the white background and black font of the terminal 
window when I need to do any coding or editing, but it seems like it's a 
bit of a chore to get it on this machine and distro.

Warning to other clueless Linux newbies... Don't buy a machine with 
nVidia chips in it and expect smooth sailing with FC5!!  But if you do, 
then at least you can get great help on this forum!

Bill,

   Nah, it isn't the machine or the distribution.

   What virtual terminals are you running? rxvt? eterm? aterm? xterm? All of
'em support the command line options of '-fg white -bg black'. You can
change the cursor color, put the scroll bar on the right instead of on the
left, and do all sorts of customization. Look at the man pages for the
details. My preference is for rxvt, but I use an xterm within pine, and both
a- and eterms support transparency if you like looking at the pattern of
your root window decoration behind your text. Cool effect, but I found it
too distracting for older eyes.

   From within X, whichever desktop/window manager you use to invoke
applications will let you specify the command line to invoke terminal
windows. Put the options there.

   Well, there goes the morning as you have fun trying different virtual
terminals and deciding just which options you want for them. :-)

I have a question for you.  Have you ever thought about running X just 
once and using <CTRL>+<ALT>+F1|F2|F3|F4|F5|F5 to get to the text 
console...and then <CTRL>+<ALT>+F7 to return to the GUI?  It would save 
you from having to continually start and stop X all the time.

One of the things I really really like to do with my terminals is to use 
gnome-terminal, set the background to black, foreground to white, remove 
all scrollbars and menubars.  I then set up a shortcut key inside the 
keyboard shortcuts preference to make <ALT>+<ENTER> enter fullscreen 
mode.  I then go <ALT>+<ENTER> and I'm presented with a fullscreen 
terminal window that is almost indistinguishable from the normal 
console...except that it's running at a higher resolution, has the fonts 
I choose to use and I can run X apps (ie. Firefox) without having to get 
sidetracked and start X.

Just to comment on NVidia cards and the invisible cursor problem.  The 
problem is in absolutely no way specific to Fedora Core 5.  The problem 
exists with just about all of the major Linux distributions as it is a 
problem with X.org itself and not any changes that the Fedora project 
has made.  Note that many NVidia cards also do not have this problem and 
it appears to be limited to certain chipsets (maybe firmware).  The 
problem also occurs in a graphical boot-up (runlevel 5) configuration, 
not just 'startx'.  The reason it can affect graphical boot-up modes is 
because many distros are using a graphical X session to display bootup 
statistics and then restart X to bring up the GDM/KDM (GNOME/KDE display 
manager).  It's this process of restarting X that appears to corrupt the 
hardware mouse cursor on some NVidia hardware.

??? ! Hmm, no I didn't know you could do that. We newbies who are so 
used to Windows and DOS have to unlearn a few things.

I'll take a look Gnome terminal soonest. Your last two paragraphs pretty 
much point the way to getting me where I want to be. Thanks again!

Yes, but my earlier problem of not being able to get my NIC to connect 
was also directly related to nVidia chips . So I'm a little less than 
impressed with those chips. Of course, I still know so little perhaps I 
should be sparing with the negative comments until I actually know what 
I'm talking about...

First, grab the binary nvidia drivers.  Aside from being good with the
3D stuff, they're supposedly faster (I can't say, I use ATI these
days).  

Then, add to the above section of your xorg.conf:

Option "SWcursor"
Option "NoRenderExtension"

At least, this is what worked when I had a similar problem on another
system a while back.

   I cannot find this information in either the ORA "Learning GNU Emacs" or

   A data file consists of columns of numbers. Within a single column I want
to search for a specific integer value and replace that with a string. I
cannot figure out how to block such a region. When I press ctrl-enter to
highlight the first column, and continue down the file, entire lines are
blocked.

   What's frustrating is that my old DOS editor, Multi-Edit, had this
capability and was tremendously useful for manipulating large numeric data
files such as satellite imagery. I'm sure that over the past three decades
or so, someone's had a need to mark a block within emacs and operate just
within that.

What mode are you in where ctrl-enter selects a column? I've wanted to
do that in the past, and not known an easy way (so I just make a
selection and use C-x r k to kill the rectangle and C-x r y to yank it
back into *scratch*).  Or better yet, what's the name of the function
bound to C-ret ?

Since I'm not sure how to make rectangular selections, I can't test
this, but 'narrow-to-region' *might* work, once you make the
selection.  It will restrict the buffer to the selected text, at which
point you can work as if the remainder of the document didn't exist.
Run 'widen' (C-x n w) to go back to normal.

   Pages 230-236 in the dead tree edition. I can kill, delete, yank, clear,
or add a rectangle, but not conduct search and replace. Oh, well.

Not necessarily the easiest solution, but how about using

I'm using gnu emacs 21.4, and I don't see "Rectangles" anywhere.  Is
this an xemacs thing?

Carlos,

   No. If you place the cursor on the space where you want to start marking
then press C-@ (or C-space for most of us), then you move the cursor to the
end of the rectangle + 1 space (just as with regular block marking). You can
then press C-x-r <key> to kill, yank, clear, etc. the marked rectangle. The
addition of the 'r' tells emacs you're dealing with a rectangle and not a
block that extends to the end of each line.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0608292041340.5568@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Folks here were so helpful this morning with Bill's nVidia mouse issues in
X that I'm hoping you can help me solve a problem with the mouse on
consoles.

   gmp is running, and when I move the trackball the cursor rectangle moves
across the screen as directed. When I hold down the left button and drag, I
can highlight text. But, I cannot then use the 'middle' button (both of
them) or the right button to paste the blocked text. This used to work just
fine; it stopped some months ago and I don't recall just when. It _may_ have
been when the old trackball finally wore out and was replace by the Logitech
orbit.

   I've read the man page and found nothing of value there. The last time I
searched with Google I didn't find anything pertinent.

   The gpm daemon is started with '/usr/sbin/gpm -m /dev/mouse -t ps2'.
/dev/mouse is a soft link to /dev/psaux. Neither of these has been changed
in years. I'd really like to fix the problem and your help will be
appreciated.

Try holding down the shift key as you drag (or highlight), then also
hold it down when you middle click.

Good Luck,

   I've tried that, Derek. That's how it works in X so I've tried it that way
on the console, too. No difference. I've also tried Alt and Ctrl.

   Forgot to mention last evening that I've tried other mouse types on the
gpm command line, but either it makes no difference or I lose the pointer
completely.

   It's a really annoying issue that showed up relatively recently.

Yum has an extension that will so this.  Smart does as well, if I remember

I have done RPM updates by hand.  Not fun.  Yum and similar tools make the
process so much nicer.  (Especially with tools like yumex.)

Has apt ever been modified to handle multiple architecture installs?  (Like
x86_64.)

I always though debian-unstable was pretty far behind the curve.  The ones
at the front tend to be Fedora and Gentoo. (As well as OpenSuSE.)

Fedora Core 1 has a number of issues.  Fedora Core 5 is much more stable.

As for Slackware init scripts...  It depends on what you mean by readable.
Almost all Redhat init scripts look alike.  Once you understand how one
works, the rest are simple.  Slackware init scripts are from the bad old
days of Solaris style tangled init script.  If you are used to them, they
are not too bad, but they are still a mess and they are very hard for an
installer to work with without serious kludges.  (I had to build a Slackware
box reciently.  I was amazed how little they had learned from the
experiences of others since 1995.

The problem of library interdependacies is distro independant.  Each handle
it differently.

The problem is library interface changes and security.

If you have a program that wants version 1.1.1 of library foo and another
that wants 1.2.0, what do you do?  Keep both? What if there is a security
related bug in version 1.1.1? Do you backport the patch to 1.1.1 from 1.2.0?
What if it is a rewrite?  Multiple libraries are a pain.  RPM handles it by
adding in compat-foo packages and then trying to backport packages.  I
assume Debian does something similar.  Slackware just lets you have
overlapping libraries.  Who knows if they get patched.

The problem becomes knowing what to install and why.  Software in Linux is
becoming more and more interconnected.  As libraries use chunks from other
libraries, it generates this big web of dependancies.  Because the packager
is usually trying to address the largest audience as possible, they drag in
more and more packages.  The only way to get out of this is to break
packages the Slackwear way or use Gentoo and build just what you need.

I have been looking at building an "core and extras" set of dvds for FC5.
Just to busy trying to get Compiz to work on my laptop.

For the most part, I have been very happy with Fedora.  Yes it is bleeding
edge, but that is because they are trying to do useful things.  If they
didn't, it would not be as useful.

There is a gpm option on my system called "-2" which forces emulation of 
a two button mouse.  From the gpm man page:
"Force  two  buttons.  This means that the middle button, if any, will

If that doesn't work, there is a program called "inputattach" that is 
used to change the type of mouse that gpm uses...I think.  It comes 
bundled with the gpm package on my system.  Have a look at the following 
command:
$> inputattach --help

That will list all the support mouse types.  The ones you'll probably be 
interested in are the "2-button Microsoft mice" (--microsoft) or 
"3-button mice in Microsoft mode" (--mshack).  The former one uses 
right-click for paste, the latter one uses right-click and middle-click 
for pasting.  There might be a better driver for your trackball but the 
MS ones seem to work for most people.

So you might try:
$> inputattach --microsoft /dev/mouse

I am not sure how well X plays with this or whether the inputattach 
settings are saved across gpm restarts.

Daniel,

   This does not seem to be the issue.

   No inputattach here, unfortunately.

   I can type 'gpm -t help' and get a list of all available types. The only

Subject: [PLUG] Rectangular Editing
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0608310650540.28921@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   A couple of days ago I asked about editing a rectangular region using
emacs, and Russell pointed me to the docs on how to do this. While emacs
will let me block and move (or delete) a rectangular region within the text
file, it won't let me edit within it. That is, no restricted find or search
and replace.

   This morning (too late for this one data file I was modifying a couple of
days ago), I re-discovered that 'joe' can do this. Press ctrl-t x, and use
the usual block marking commands (ctrl-k b and ctrl-k k) to mark the
rectangular area. Within that one can find (using ctrl-k f) and search and
replace (ctrl-k r).

   Do not take this as a slur on emacs, but as a resource for when you, too,
need to change columns in a data file.

Message-ID: <200608301639.08375.carla@bratgrrl.com>

o great pluggers,

I am futzing with Pyramid Linux on a Soekris board to build a nice Internet 
router and wireless access point. It's a temporary setup because next week 
I'm blowing it away and using Bering instead, which is much nicer. (long 
story, don't ask.) But for now I must make it work. 

The wireless bit works perfectly; clients find the WAP and get DHCP, ping back 
and forth, etc. But it ends there. I want the wireless clients to get the 
same goodies as the wired LAN clients, Internet and LAN services.

Pyramid does not have bridge-utils, so as near as I can tell there is no way 
to bridge the wireless NIC to the wired LAN NIC without rebuilding the whole 
dern operaring system (insert much cussing.)  So what other options do I 
have? I spose a couple iptables rules will do the job- what about routing? 

thanks!

Are the internal wired, wireless and Internet all interfaces on the same
unit?  Are the internal wired and wireless separate IP networks?  If so,
assuming you're using NAT between the wired LAN and Internet, then it
should just be a matter of one iptables rule to do the outbound NAT.
Since the router interfaces are the default gateways for both the
wireless and wired LAN, the router should be able to forward packets
transparently between the two; you will, of course, want to lock down
what the wireless LAN can read on the wired or, depending the default
rulesets, need to open the rules a bit.  Should be pretty
straightforward.

First: Search Freshmeat.net for "SMS".  Manymanymany things there.

Second: What does "SMS server" mean?  What does it do?

Third: As far as I know, any ol' email server can send SMS three ways: 
(1) Using a modem and a cell company's TAP pager gateway.
(2) Using an email->SMS gateway provided by the cellphone company.
(3) Using commandline utilities such as Gnokii to send SMS via a
    cellphone or cell modem.

I've used (1) and (2) with Nagios at previous jobs.  Problem with (1) is
that TAP gateways are going away.  Problems with (2) are that you need a
working internet connection and you have to know the target's cellphone
provider.

I haven't tried (3) yet, but you need a cheap cellphone account for it.
That one might allow you to receive SMS as well.

Pyramid is based on Ubuntu Breezy.  You can get whatever package you
need for pyramid, unpack it on your Ubuntu live-cd box, copy the
necessary files to the pyramid image.  dpkg -L <foo> for the list of
files in the package.  I did this at least once (twice or thrice i
think) for PTP nodes.

I like pyramid.  No reason not to use it I can see.  It's biggest
drawback was that the image was hand-hacked to fit in 64meg, which
means it isn't easy to rebuild on a newer distribution.  It also lost
the dpkg/apt/etc in the process, so you can't install packages easily
on the fly, like you used to be able to with pebble.

Another quirk of pebble/pyramid is that in order to write to your file
system, you need to make the file system writable, e.g. using the
convenience script "remountrw".  When done, reverse to readonly with
"remountro".  Some files that need to be writable are symbolic linked
to a tmpfs filesystem.  Those files, such as hostname, resolv.conf,
etc are located in a /ro tree that gets copied to /rw on startup.  The
symbolic links point at the /rw tree.

If you've got any more pyramid questions, please let me know and i'll
try to help.

Will Vonage work over a private TCP/IP network that is Internet connected
via a Linux gateway?  My friend's Linksys made Vonage router configures 
itself via dhcp designed for direct connection to the Internet.  Theoretically,
it should be possible to give a Vonage router a private network router and have
that router masquerade the necessary ports onto the Net for it to work.

This is an interesting web site:

For the hardware on http://www.voicetronix.com.au/index.htm, 
does anyone have any experience with it?  I could use some help 
understanding the terminology.  What is SIP?  How about FXO and 
FXS?

I've looked into the Skutch CK-4 and Teltone line simulators, they
are exorbitently expensive and I'd have to replace some phone lines.
Worse than that, I have more than 4 locations that should have their
own phone number if possible in my network.

In a few places I have wireless links, but no phone lines.  For cost
and appearance reasons, I don't want to run physical lines everywhere.

Do the voicetronix products only allow people to spread a POTS line(s)
over an IP network?  I want to allow telephony across my ethernet
lan, but not beyond it unless a code is entered.  I want to avoid 
expensive POTS simulators.

PSTN phone lines are too expensive and there aren't enough of them coming 
in anyways for every single room in my network.

Can the Linksys made Vonage routers be reprogrammed to work with open source
software?  I wish Voicetronix would offer a nice solution similar to the 
Linksys router that Vonage uses.  There are plenty of people talking about 
VoIP as a paid service, but what about those of us who want to deploy it 
over our own private lan?

It will work but could give you bad voice quality as the linksys has
built in QOS to give sip traffic priority.  You can do it on linux but you
will have to install class based queuing and give the ip traffic from
your linksys priority.

You ask a lot of questions that could be answered by going to wikipedia.
Sip is the udp protocol for real-time voice traffic. It actually covers the
call setup,ring, and call teardown.
For fxo fxs look here.

You will have to buy hardware but what you spend depends on
the level of quality and expectations.
http://www.digitnetworks.com/store/ is one of the places I would start
looking to buy hardware but not necessarily the only place.  For a home
system you should look into asterisk or sipX.

Doable but not without a local pbx system like asterisk or sipX

You will have to have a network drop for each phone or fxo gateway.

You can use the sipphone service.  I use it with a softphone and it works
quite well for out-going calls but incomming requires changes to the
router to allow sip traffic into the network.  My work is not ready to do
that yet without using a voip provider or local voip pbx.

Thanks for the reply,

Check out this link,

http://manageengine.adventnet.com/products/opmanager/send-sms.html

it's pretty much what i am trying to accomplish. I do use OpManager right
now to monitor our network, it does send me email messages when a server or
router goes down. What i was hoping to build was some redundency, so if the
email server went down, i would still be notified of failure.

Of course, this solution requires a special modem and SIM card. the solution
you provided seems more simplified, but a little confusing. I have never
done anything like this before.

So, if you could be more specific that would certainly help.

Thanks again,

Joe

Ok, I take it back :)

Matt Westervelt at Metrix was very helpful and pointed me to their Subversion 
repo. http://pyramid.metrix.net/

The current build has bridge-utils and pcmcia support, though I still can't 
make it see any of my pcmcia 10/100 cards. I'll dig into this later, 
hopefully it's something easy like missing yenta_socket or something.

No package management, no user forums, and not much documentation are all 
little hurdles to deal with. In this era of 8-gig CF cards it might not be 
vitally important to produce the smallest possible distribution, but I like 
that devs are trying.

It helpfully tells you the scriptnames when you SSH in:

/sbin/rw - remount the file system read-write
/sbin/ro - remount the file system read-only

Thanks, it is easy with iptables, I was just not wanting to. The latest build 
put bridge-utils back in, so I'm going to build me a bridge.

It is vital for devices without a CF socket.  E.g. the soekris 4526
and 4826 that the metrix boxes use have 64 meg of flash soldered on.
The 4826 has a USB1 header, so you can add more storage (it's just a
pain).

If you've got lots of storage, you could go ahead and just install
debian!  ;-)

If I understand correctly, you're looking for ordinary one-way
pager-notification.  I used to do that with Nagios.

That's (3) as I was describing in my previous email.  Easiest way is
(2), just add in a notification email to your cell provider's email-sms
gateway.  E.g. for a T-Mobile cell at 503-555-1234, add
5035551234 at tmomail.net to your notification list.

I've been pretty specific so far, and given you information and pointers
to resources that will allow you to solve your problem.  I hate to be
rude here, but this is not the ManageEngine Support forum.

OK,

I guess what i was getting at was that it didn't really matter what network
managing software it is, i was pointing to OpManager because it used a linux
platform. It could be anything for all i care.

I guess what i was looking for was someone who knew how SMS functioned in a
network inviroment, and how i could configure something to achieve
notifications via phone.

And yes, a one way pager notification. Sorry, im just a little new to the
concepts like SMS and how that functions.

Subject: [PLUG] more fun with Pyramid Linux
Message-ID: <200608312231.11091.carla@bratgrrl.com>

For anyone who's interested in this small saga- I had originally installed the 
pyramid-1.0b1.img.gz using good ole dd from a PC with a CF reader/writer. 
Then pop the CF card into its slot on a nice ebay Soekris 4521, and voila! 
All done. (you may follow my adventures in detail here,
http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/nethub/article.php/3627861
http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/nethub/article.php/3627861
http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/nethub/article.php/3629216)

Unfortunately that particular release has a number of problems, including no 
ethernet bridging or pcmcia support. So the nice folks at Metris pointed me 
to the Subversion repo for the current build. Which is all nice, but it's 
just the filesystem with no boot sector. I don't know how to build a bootable 
image, but of course in Linuxland there are many paths, grasshoppers. I 
popped the CF card back into the reader/writer, deleted all the non-volatile 
directories, and copied over the new ones. Stuffed it back into the Soekris 
board, booted up, and voila! It boots, it runs, and it detected both of my PC 
cards. Haven't tried bridging yet, but it looks like all the right files are 
there.

Just try to do that with certain redmondware, or applegoo....

You don't have to rebuild anything, you just boot your Ubuntu Breezy
Live-CD on a box of your choice, figure out which package you want to
add to your pyramid image, run:

  dpkg -L <package-name>

and look at the file list.  E.g.:

  $ dpkg -L bridge-utils
  /.
  /etc
  /etc/network
  /etc/network/if-pre-up.d
  /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/bridge
  /etc/network/if-post-down.d
  /etc/network/if-post-down.d/bridge
  /usr
  /usr/sbin
  /usr/sbin/brctl
  /usr/share
  /usr/share/doc
  /usr/share/doc/bridge-utils
  /usr/share/doc/bridge-utils/README
  /usr/share/doc/bridge-utils/THANKS
  /usr/share/doc/bridge-utils/TODO
  /usr/share/doc/bridge-utils/FAQ
  /usr/share/doc/bridge-utils/FIREWALL
  /usr/share/doc/bridge-utils/HOWTO
  /usr/share/doc/bridge-utils/PROJECTS
  /usr/share/doc/bridge-utils/SMPNOTES
  /usr/share/doc/bridge-utils/WISHLIST
  /usr/share/doc/bridge-utils/changelog.gz
  /usr/share/doc/bridge-utils/copyright
  /usr/share/doc/bridge-utils/README.Debian.gz
  /usr/share/doc/bridge-utils/changelog.Debian.gz
  /usr/share/man
  /usr/share/man/man8
  /usr/share/man/man8/brctl.8.gz

Figure out which ones are needed (basically /usr/sbin/brctl, and
/etc/network/if*/bridge), and copy them over to your pyramid image
(mount it somewhere and copy away, using utility of your choice).
Test and... Viola!  Package (or the interesting bits anyway)
installed!

You need to test because brctl might depend on something not already
present (I vaguely remember a library, ldd helps here).  Rinse and
repeat.  You might also need a kernel module, not sure.  A few
iterations and you are done.  Not.  That.  Hard.

It's only a 19 incher, those are easy! I could toss those around all day.
Now attempting to go bowling with one would be a bit of a challenge. Then
of course there are the 21 inch ones which weigh 70 pounds, oof!

Subject: [PLUG] CRT dark...
Message-ID: <1157069485.44f77aade3556@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I have a 19" Viewsonic that has gotten dark.  I like it because it is compatible
with Linux, it can acheive 1600x1280 max resolution.

Apparently I can donate it for $10 to get rid of it, but naturally I'm wondering
about getting it fixed instead.

PSU posts Metro's number.

Even if I do get it fixed, it'll go dark again eventually.  This raises the
question, how can I keep track of monitor compatibility with Linux and X?
Replacement is easier to accomplish than repair.

Probably all I need is a tube swap, shouldn't be a big deal, but it appears
that there aren't any buinesses that will do that anymore.

Regards,

Michael C. Robinson
